            "content": "1 Overview . When starting a data science project, you will want to understand the data that you have, how they are related, and whether it would be feasible to extract patterns from the data. One measure commonly used is correlation - which tells you the strength of the relationship among the data. . This artical looks at ways to measure data relationships, using various measures of correlation, and some related measures that might be better such as predictive power score . . 2 Finding and Loading Datasets . The sklearn.datasets package contains several functions to load datasets. These functions are used throughout the scikit-learn documentation of the various algorithms. These datasets are easy to use, and in any event it is quite a useful skill to know how to load sample datasets from the different machine learning libraries. . The code below lists the datasets in the sklearn.datasets package. . Tip: Use the dir function to list the contents of a package . import pandas as pd import re import sklearn.datasets from sklearn.datasets import load_iris pd.DataFrame({&#39;some scikit-learn functions to load data&#39; : [m for m in dir(sklearn.datasets) if re.match(&#39;fetch|make|load&#39;, m)] } ).sample(12).style.hide_index() . some scikit-learn functions to load data . load_sample_images | . fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized | . load_iris | . load_files | . make_swiss_roll | . fetch_species_distributions | . fetch_covtype | . load_boston | . make_s_curve | . fetch_20newsgroups | . make_hastie_10_2 | . load_svmlight_file | . 3 Load Iris Data . We will choose the iris dataset since it is a small, easy to understand dataset that is commonly used for examples in scikit-learn and other machine learning libraries. We use the load_iris function to load the iris data. The function parameters return_X_y, and as_frame are self-explanatory, but pay attention to what they do, as it affects the shape of your data and how you can do machine learning afterwards. . X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True, as_frame=True) X.describe().round(2) . sepal length (cm) sepal width (cm) petal length (cm) petal width (cm) . count 150.00 | 150.00 | 150.00 | 150.00 | . mean 5.84 | 3.06 | 3.76 | 1.20 | . std 0.83 | 0.44 | 1.77 | 0.76 | . min 4.30 | 2.00 | 1.00 | 0.10 | . 25% 5.10 | 2.80 | 1.60 | 0.30 | . 50% 5.80 | 3.00 | 4.35 | 1.30 | . 75% 6.40 | 3.30 | 5.10 | 1.80 | . max 7.90 | 4.40 | 6.90 | 2.50 | . There are four features - sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width. These are all numeric, continuous features, and there are no missing values, which makes it easier to compute correlation. . 4 About Correlation . Correlation is a way of measuring how closely your data items are reated. If you have a dataframe, the easiest way to compute the correlation among your features is to use the dataframe corr. Within the corr function there are three methods used to calculate correlation. . Pearson . There is a linear relationship | The data is normal | For interval or ratio data - not for categorical or ordinal data | . Spearman . Interval or ratio or ordinal data - not for categorical | Monotonic relationship - either always increasing or always decreasing | . . Kendall . Ordinal data | The data does not have to be normal | Returns values from 0 : no relationship to 1 : perfect relationship. (Oddly, Kendall can produce negative values which can be ignored) | . Type of data Description Correlation Method . Interval | Numeric data measured along a regular range e.g. temperature | Pearson, Spearman | . Ratio | Numeric data, but 0 means there are none of that variable | Pearson, Spearman | . Ordinal | Categorical data that can be ordered e.g.&quot;How much do you like ice cream&quot; | Kendall, Spearman | . Nominal | Data with two or more categories e.g. &quot;What type of house do you live in&quot; | | . 4.1 Chart using different correlation methods . The pandas dataframe corr function computes the correlation using one of 3 methods. Pearson is the default, standard measure. Spearman and Kendall are recommended if there are concerns about whether the data is normal. . import seaborn as sns def chart_correlation(data, method=&#39;pearson&#39;): # Calculate the correlation among the columns X_corr = X.corr(method=method) # Use only two decimal places. You don&#39;t need to but looks nicer with pd.option_context(&#39;display.precision&#39;, 2): # Use a sea green color palette cm = sns.light_palette(&quot;seagreen&quot;, as_cmap=True) return ( X_corr # This is all the method needs to return # But styling makes it look nicer .style.background_gradient(cmap=cm, low=-0.6, high=0.2) .set_caption(f&#39;Iris dataset - {method} correlation&#39;) ) . Pearson Correlation . This is the default and which you will use most often. . chart_correlation(X) . Iris dataset - pearson correlation sepal length (cm) sepal width (cm) petal length (cm) petal width (cm) . sepal length (cm) 1.00 | -0.12 | 0.87 | 0.82 | . sepal width (cm) -0.12 | 1.00 | -0.43 | -0.37 | . petal length (cm) 0.87 | -0.43 | 1.00 | 0.96 | . petal width (cm) 0.82 | -0.37 | 0.96 | 1.00 | . Spearman Correlation . chart_correlation(X, &#39;spearman&#39;) . Iris dataset - spearman correlation sepal length (cm) sepal width (cm) petal length (cm) petal width (cm) . sepal length (cm) 1.00 | -0.17 | 0.88 | 0.83 | . sepal width (cm) -0.17 | 1.00 | -0.31 | -0.29 | . petal length (cm) 0.88 | -0.31 | 1.00 | 0.94 | . petal width (cm) 0.83 | -0.29 | 0.94 | 1.00 | . Kendall Correlation . Kendall is generally used for ordinal data. The iris data is not ordinal, but this method still produces a heatmap that looks similar to the other methods. Note that the Kendall method can produce negative numbers, but the sign can be ignored since the Kendall range is between 0 and 1 - with 1 being perfect correlation. . chart_correlation(X, &#39;kendall&#39;) . Iris dataset - kendall correlation sepal length (cm) sepal width (cm) petal length (cm) petal width (cm) . sepal length (cm) 1.00 | -0.08 | 0.72 | 0.66 | . sepal width (cm) -0.08 | 1.00 | -0.19 | -0.16 | . petal length (cm) 0.72 | -0.19 | 1.00 | 0.81 | . petal width (cm) 0.66 | -0.16 | 0.81 | 1.00 | . 5. Pairwise Plots . A pairwise plot is a series of plots showing the correlation of each variable against each other. This can be done using seaborn&#39;s pairplot function. Here we use it to plot the features of the iris dataset, and this provides visual clues as to how the features are related. . sns.pairplot(X, height=2); . 5.1 Adding more information - the species . To gain more utility from the pairplot we can add the target variable - which denotes the species - and then use a hue parameter to add this as colors to the pairplot. With this new information we can see how each of the species is distributed by feature. This gives us a visual cue that the target variable - species - can be detected by a machine learning algorithm. . # Add the species to the dataframe. We will use this to color the pairplot iris_data = pd.concat([X,y], axis=1).rename(columns=({&#39;target&#39;:&#39;species&#39;})) # Set the hue to &#39;species&#39; sns.pairplot(iris_data, hue=&#39;species&#39;, palette=sns.color_palette(&quot;muted&quot;,3), height=2); . 6 Distance Correlation . Distance correlation, first introduced by Gábor J. Székely in 2005, measures the dependence between two pairs of random vectors or arbitrary, if not equal dimension. It fixes some of the issues with Pearson correlation. Distance correlation has been found to have higher statistical power (fewer false positives than Pearson), to find non-linear associations. . Distance correlation ranges from 0-2. 0 means perfect correlation, 1 means no correlation and 2 being perfect anticorrelation. A small correlation means that the points are close in correlational space. . Distance Correlation was further elaborated on by Donald Richards, a professor at Penn State University. In his paper Donald Richards discussed two examples of using distance correlation to good effect. In his first example, Mercedes Richards, an astrphysics professor (also his late wife), used distance correlation to resolve galaxies of different shapes e.g. horseshoe, or spiral galaxies - with greater accuracy than when using Pearson correlation. . For his second example, Donald Richards reported that Washington Post reporter had found using Pearson correlation almost no relationship between homicide rates and the strength of state gun laws. However, using distance correlation, and partitioning by population the states by region and/or population density, Richards found a strong statistical relationship. . Donald Richards is of Jamaican descent, and is also a very good writer. His statistical paper begins . The difficulties of detecting association, measuring correlation, and establishing cause and effect have fascinated mankind since time immemorial. Democritus, the Greek philosopher, underscored well the importance and the difficulty of proving causality when he wrote, “I would rather discover one cause than gain the kingdom of Persia” . Also, when referring to homicide-gun law link . &quot;As sure as my first name is “Donald”, this part of the talk will be Huge&quot; . 6.1 Function to Chart Distance Correlation . from scipy.spatial import distance . def chart_distance_correlation(data): dist_corr = lambda column1, column2: distance.correlation(column1, column2) result = data.apply(lambda col1: data.apply(lambda col2: dist_corr(col1, col2))) with pd.option_context(&#39;display.precision&#39;, 2): # Use a sea green color palette cm = sns.light_palette(&quot;seagreen&quot;, as_cmap=True) return ( result.style.background_gradient(cmap=cm, low=-0.1, high=0.2) .set_caption(f&#39;Iris dataset - distance correlation&#39;) ) chart_distance_correlation(X) . Iris dataset - distance correlation sepal length (cm) sepal width (cm) petal length (cm) petal width (cm) . sepal length (cm) 0.00 | 1.12 | 0.13 | 0.18 | . sepal width (cm) 1.12 | 0.00 | 1.43 | 1.37 | . petal length (cm) 0.13 | 1.43 | 0.00 | 0.04 | . petal width (cm) 0.18 | 1.37 | 0.04 | 0.00 | . 6.2 Distance Correlation Links . dcor distance correlation Library . Scpiy distance correlation . Distance Correlation: A New Tool for Detecting Associations - Donald Richards . Profile of Donald Richards - Quanta Magazine . Distance Correlation Wikipedia . StackOverflow Distance Correlation . 7 Predictive Power Score - A Better Correlation . Predictive Power Score - ppscore - is a new measure of how data features are related. It answers the question - how much can A be used to predict B . It is an improvement over correlation in a few important respects. . Most importantly, it works on categorical data - which none of the 3 correlation methods looked at above does. | It is asymmetric, meaning if can tell you the strength of a relationship between variables in both directions. So the ppscore for how much feature A can predict B is different for the ppscore for B predicting A. This gives you more information to use to decide how to do your modeling | It measures strength of non linear relationships - correlation only measures linear relationships | PP score is related to but different from Feature Importance. Feature importance scores normally take into account all features when calculating the score for an indivicual feature, while PP score ie is calculated on just that feature. . 7.1 Using the ppscore library . Predictive Power Score is implemented in the new ppscore library. First you install the library . {bash} pip install ppscore . If you have a dataframe df you can use pps.score to measure x predicting y . {python} pps.score(df, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) . RIP Correlation - Hello Predictive Power Score . ppscore on github . 7.2 Charting the ppscore . import ppscore as pps cm = sns.light_palette(&quot;seagreen&quot;, as_cmap=True) pps.matrix(X)[[&#39;x&#39;, &#39;y&#39;, &#39;ppscore&#39;]] .pivot(columns=&#39;x&#39;, index=&#39;y&#39;, values=&#39;ppscore&#39;) .style.background_gradient() .set_precision(3) .set_caption(&#39;Predictive Power Score&#39;) . Conclusion . In these notes we showed what correlation is, various ways to measure it, and a new way - Predictive Power Score to get improvements over standard correlation functions . References .

            "content": ". Overview . Pandas is a container for rectangular data but it is astonishingly flexible in what you can put inside. . You can put images inside a dataframe - if you conceive an image being a rectangular block of numbers. You can read a word document into a pandas dataframe - with each paragraph occupying a cell. Even HTML can be read into a dataframe - or at least HTML tables - which are extremely common. And with this flexibility in what a dataframe can contain also comes severel ways to get data inside. . Naturally we start with import pandas as pd . import pandas as pd . Read Functions . Pandas has several functions for reading data. To view these functions, let&#39;s list all the functions that starts with read_ . Tip: Use dir(obj) on a python object to view what&#39;s inside . [a for a in dir(pd) if a.startswith(&#39;read&#39;)] . [&#39;read_clipboard&#39;, &#39;read_csv&#39;, &#39;read_excel&#39;, &#39;read_feather&#39;, &#39;read_fwf&#39;, &#39;read_gbq&#39;, &#39;read_hdf&#39;, &#39;read_html&#39;, &#39;read_json&#39;, &#39;read_orc&#39;, &#39;read_parquet&#39;, &#39;read_pickle&#39;, &#39;read_sas&#39;, &#39;read_spss&#39;, &#39;read_sql&#39;, &#39;read_sql_query&#39;, &#39;read_sql_table&#39;, &#39;read_stata&#39;, &#39;read_table&#39;] . There are at least 19 read functions from a wide variety of data sources. Youcan read data from the clipboard, or from html, or from sql databases. . Tip: use ? at the end of a function to see what it can do . pd.read_sql_table? . Reading CSVs . 99% of the time I use pd.read_csv since it 99% of the time you are doing a data science project the data is in a comma separated value file. I say 99%, mainly to make a point, but this holds for projects that are shared via the web. Inside companies, CSVs are still popular, but you are also more likely to find that data is in databases or json files or excel sheets. Nevertheless, CSVs are very commonly used, and so pd.read_csv is your go to means of reading data. . pd.read_csv is a pretty versatile function, and that versatility comes from being based on an even more versatile function pd.read_table. Mostly, you can use either pd.read_csv or pd.read_table interchangeably, except that pd.read_csv is more focused on CSVs. . Where to get CSVs . CSVs are easy to find. Here are a few sources . Data.gov (USA) | Open Canada Data | Kaggle Datasets | . Reading a CSV File . Firstly, d.read_csv works identically on a local file as it does with a url. To illustrate, we found a CSV file on Data.gov about runways in Notrh Dakota, and we can load it directly with the url, or with the local file after downloading. Therefore - these are file paths are identical. . runways_in_north_dakota_url = &#39;https://gishubdata.nd.gov/sites/default/files/NDHUB.AirportRunways.csv&#39; runways_in_north_dakota_file = &#39;data/pandas/NDHUB.AirportRunways.csv&#39; . Now we can read the data into a dataframe and then display it . nd_runways = pd.read_csv(runways_in_north_dakota_url) nd_runways .

So now you can see the value and the power of using pandas for reading csvs - with just a line of code. And since there is a a lot of valuable data available in CSVs, knowing how to read this into pandas for processing is a valuable skill indeed. . CSV data can get pretty varied you will need to know how to use some of the parameters of read_csv depending on the data you are reading. As noted before, you can use ? at the end of a function in a Jupyter notebook to display documentation. Here we do something slightly different - we want to load that documentation into a pandas DataFrame and display it. We will use pd.read_csv.__doc__ to get the documentation. . Tip: You can use __doc__ to access the documentation for a python function or object . Pandas Read CSV Documentation . The function documentation isn&#39;t exactly rectangular data - but a data scientist takes data from one shape to another. The code gets the docstring, does some stripping and splitting until we have a below does this. . Note: this code won&#39;t work for all docstring since the format varies but it works for this function . read_csv_parameters = pd.DataFrame( # Create a Dataframe [line.split(&#39;:&#39;) for line # For every line split each by colon in pd.read_csv.__doc__.split(&#39; n&#39;) # Get the docstring and split into lines if &#39; :&#39; in line # Keep if &quot; :&quot; is in the line and not line.startswith(&#39; &#39;) # And there is no leading spaces and &#39;,&#39; in line], # And there is a comma in the line columns=[&#39;parameter&#39;,&#39;description&#39;] # Set the column names ).applymap(lambda x: x.strip()) # Strip all spaces from the dataframe . Concepts covered in the code above . list comprehensions | filters in list comprehensions | Splitting strings | Creating a dataframe from a list of lists | Using applymap to strip spaces from all cells of a dataframe | . So now we have the dataframe, the code below makes it look a little nicer by using the dataframe styler. I use it to highlight the parameters that I use, depending on the need. . Tip: learn how to use dataframe styling .. you&#39;ll probably get paid more :-) . params_to_highlight = [&#39;filepath_or_buffer&#39;,&#39;delimiter&#39;, &#39;usecols&#39;,&#39;dtype&#39;, &#39;sep&#39;, &#39;nrows&#39;,&#39;skiprows&#39;, &#39;low_memory&#39;, &#39;names&#39;] def highight_parameter(param): is_key = param.isin(params_to_highlight) return [&#39;background-color: #a7b9f1; font-weight:bold&#39; if v else &#39;&#39; for v in is_key] read_csv_parameters.style.hide_index().apply(highight_parameter, axis=1) . parameter description . filepath_or_buffer | str, path object or file-like object | . sep | str, default &#39;,&#39; | . delimiter | str, default ``None`` | . header | int, list of int, default &#39;infer&#39; | . names | array-like, optional | . index_col | int, str, sequence of int / str, or False, default ``None`` | . usecols | list-like or callable, optional | . squeeze | bool, default False | . prefix | str, optional | . mangle_dupe_cols | bool, default True | . dtype | Type name or dict of column -&gt; type, optional | . engine | {&#39;c&#39;, &#39;python&#39;}, optional | . converters | dict, optional | . true_values | list, optional | . false_values | list, optional | . skipinitialspace | bool, default False | . skiprows | list-like, int or callable, optional | . skipfooter | int, default 0 | . nrows | int, optional | . na_values | scalar, str, list-like, or dict, optional | . keep_default_na | bool, default True | . na_filter | bool, default True | . verbose | bool, default False | . skip_blank_lines | bool, default True | . parse_dates | bool or list of int or names or list of lists or dict, default False | . infer_datetime_format | bool, default False | . keep_date_col | bool, default False | . date_parser | function, optional | . dayfirst | bool, default False | . cache_dates | bool, default True | . iterator | bool, default False | . chunksize | int, optional | . compression | {&#39;infer&#39;, &#39;gzip&#39;, &#39;bz2&#39;, &#39;zip&#39;, &#39;xz&#39;, None}, default &#39;infer&#39; | . thousands | str, optional | . decimal | str, default &#39;.&#39; | . lineterminator | str (length 1), optional | . quotechar | str (length 1), optional | . quoting | int or csv.QUOTE_* instance, default 0 | . doublequote | bool, default ``True`` | . escapechar | str (length 1), optional | . comment | str, optional | . encoding | str, optional | . dialect | str or csv.Dialect, optional | . error_bad_lines | bool, default True | . warn_bad_lines | bool, default True | . delim_whitespace | bool, default False | . low_memory | bool, default True | . memory_map | bool, default False | . float_precision | str, optional | .

            "content": ". Getting Started . Pandas is a python library that you install using pip . pip install pandas . or using conda . conda install pandas Most users should install the latest version though for enterprise data projects it is often important to pin to a specific pandas version to ensure API stability. . import pandas as pd . Key Ideas . There are two primary objects - DataFrame and Series. Most commonly, you will work with dataframes, which are similar to excel worksheets or database tables. You can think of a DataFrame as a rectangular data structure made up of a number of columns. Each of the columns would then be a Series. . Every dataframe or series has an Index - which is a special column. If you create a dataframe without specifying an Index, pandas will create a numeric index of range(0, len(df)). Series in the same dataframe share the same index. . Let&#39;s create three lists that contain information about cats . names = [&#39;Lucy&#39;, &#39;Bella&#39;,&#39;Lucy&#39;,&#39;Nala&#39;] ages = [2,2,3,5] colors = [&#39;gray&#39;, &#39;tabby&#39;, &#39;white&#39;, &#39;black&#39;] . Now we create a dataframe where each of the lists become a column, or in pandas terminology - a series. . df = pd.DataFrame({&#39;name&#39;: names, &#39;age&#39;: ages, &#39;color&#39;:colors}) df . name age color . 0 Lucy | 2 | gray | . 1 Bella | 2 | tabby | . 2 Lucy | 3 | white | . 3 Nala | 5 | black | . Values . The 3 individual data columns - name, age and color have been combined into a multidimensional array called values. . df.values . array([[&#39;Lucy&#39;, 2, &#39;gray&#39;], [&#39;Bella&#39;, 2, &#39;tabby&#39;], [&#39;Lucy&#39;, 3, &#39;white&#39;], [&#39;Nala&#39;, 5, &#39;black&#39;]], dtype=object) . This is a numpy array with 4 rows and 3 columns . type(df.values) . numpy.ndarray . You can see the shape of the dataframe by calling df.shape. This delegates to a call to the numpy array&#39;s shape. Generally, operations on a pandas dataframe result in operations on the underlying numpy array. . df.shape, df.values.shape . ((4, 3), (4, 3)) . Columns . You can see the list of columns in the dataframe by calling df.columns. The result for our dataframe are the names we specified as the keys to the dictionary we passed in when we created the dataframe. . df.columns . Index([&#39;name&#39;, &#39;age&#39;, &#39;color&#39;], dtype=&#39;object&#39;) . Selecting columns . A column can be accessed by passing the column name into the bracket operator e.g. using df[col]. So to get the color column, use df[&#39;color&#39;] . df[&#39;color&#39;] . 0 gray 1 tabby 2 white 3 black Name: color, dtype: object . And to get the age column use df[&#39;age&#39;]. Notice that both the color and age column include the index values [0,1,2,3,4] - because all columns in a dataframe share the same index. . df[&#39;age&#39;] . 0 2 1 2 2 3 3 5 Name: age, dtype: int64 . When you select a single column from a Dataframe you get a series. If you want to get a new dataframe with just one column use a column list with one item e.g. df[[&#39;age&#39;]] instead of df[&#39;age&#39;] . df[[&#39;age&#39;]] . age . 0 2 | . 1 2 | . 2 3 | . 3 5 | . Selecting columns - as a property . When a dataframe is created, it&#39;s columns are exposed as properties of that dataframe object, so it&#39;s possible to use the dot . operator . df.age . 0 2 1 2 2 3 3 5 Name: age, dtype: int64 . Selecting multiple columns . To select multiple columns pass in a list with the names of the columns. . df[[&#39;age&#39;, &#39;color&#39;]] . age color . 0 2 | gray | . 1 2 | tabby | . 2 3 | white | . 3 5 | black | . Notice the double brackets [[]]? The outer brackets are used for selections and the inner brackets are the list of columns. The code above is equivalent to this . age_and_color = [&#39;age&#39;, &#39;color&#39;] df[age_and_color] . age color . 0 2 | gray | . 1 2 | tabby | . 2 3 | white | . 3 5 | black | . When you select multiple columns from a dataframe, you get new dataframe with just those columns. . Adding columns . To add a new column use the same bracket access operator [] as for selecting a dataframe . df[&#39;weight&#39;] = [1.0,0.5,2.0,2.0] df . name age color weight . 0 Lucy | 2 | gray | 1.0 | . 1 Bella | 2 | tabby | 0.5 | . 2 Lucy | 3 | white | 2.0 | . 3 Nala | 5 | black | 2.0 | . Droping columns . To drop columns pass the names of columns to be dropped in a list . df.drop(columns=[&#39;weight&#39;]) . name age color . 0 Lucy | 2 | gray | . 1 Bella | 2 | tabby | . 2 Lucy | 3 | white | . 3 Nala | 5 | black | . Indexes . An absolute beginner to pandas may not need to know about indexes, especially since pandas creates indexes autmatically for you. However considers indexes to be important for its internal operations, and as your use of pandas increases you will eventually bump into index issues. . set_index . You can change the column used for the index using df.set_index, passing in the column(s) to use. Here we tell the dataframe to promote the column name to be the index. . df.index . RangeIndex(start=0, stop=4, step=1) . Index . Since we did not specify an index Pandas automatically created an index for us. Automatic indexes are always a RangeIndex from 0-len(df) . df.set_index(&#39;name&#39;) . age color weight . name . Lucy 2 | gray | 1.0 | . Bella 2 | tabby | 0.5 | . Lucy 3 | white | 2.0 | . Nala 5 | black | 2.0 | . You can set multiple columns as the index. Here we tell the dataframe to promote name, and age to be used as the index. . df1 = df.set_index([&#39;name&#39;, &#39;age&#39;]) df1 . color weight . name age . Lucy 2 gray | 1.0 | . Bella 2 tabby | 0.5 | . Lucy 3 white | 2.0 | . Nala 5 black | 2.0 | . reset_index . The opposite of set_index - which promotes a column is reset_index, which demotes the index to be a regular column. Here for example, we set the name as the index, and then reset. . df2 = df.set_index(&#39;name&#39;) df2 . age color weight . name . Lucy 2 | gray | 1.0 | . Bella 2 | tabby | 0.5 | . Lucy 3 | white | 2.0 | . Nala 5 | black | 2.0 | . Resetting the index demotes name to being a regular column . df2.reset_index() . name age color weight . 0 Lucy | 2 | gray | 1.0 | . 1 Bella | 2 | tabby | 0.5 | . 2 Lucy | 3 | white | 2.0 | . 3 Nala | 5 | black | 2.0 | . reset_index(drop=True) . Since reset_index turns an index into a regular column, if the index was a auto generated range index, then that would become a column, which in most cases is not what you want. So, almost all the time you reset the index, you will drop the column. Su use reset_index(drop=True). This happens to be very common in my Python code, especially after grouping operations where pandas creates MultiIndexes for me which I generally do not use. . df.reset_index(drop=True) . name age color weight . 0 Lucy | 2 | gray | 1.0 | . 1 Bella | 2 | tabby | 0.5 | . 2 Lucy | 3 | white | 2.0 | . 3 Nala | 5 | black | 2.0 | . Pandas Copying . Most pandas operations like set_index returns a copy of the dataframe. This is a pretty standard design pattern and it allows for pandas to avoid issues that arise from mutating dataframes. For pandas returning copies is also faster as it avoids a lot of internal operations such as updating the index etc. . As an example of a copy beining returned from a pandas operation let&#39;s drop the weight column from df . df3 = df.copy() df3[&#39;weight&#39;] = [1.0,0.5,2.0,2.0] df3.drop(columns=[&#39;weight&#39;]) . name age color . 0 Lucy | 2 | gray | . 1 Bella | 2 | tabby | . 2 Lucy | 3 | white | . 3 Nala | 5 | black | . Inspecting df shows that the weight column is still there. . df3 . name age color weight . 0 Lucy | 2 | gray | 1.0 | . 1 Bella | 2 | tabby | 0.5 | . 2 Lucy | 3 | white | 2.0 | . 3 Nala | 5 | black | 2.0 | . To change the pandas behaviour from return copies, several pandas functions allow you to specify inplace=True. Now if we drop the column it will . df3.drop(columns=[&#39;weight&#39;], inplace=True) df3 . name age color . 0 Lucy | 2 | gray | . 1 Bella | 2 | tabby | . 2 Lucy | 3 | white | . 3 Nala | 5 | black | . Reading Data . pandas can read rectangular data from almost anything. Here is a list - or rather, a dataframe containing all the pands read_* functions. . pd.DataFrame(data=[f for f in dir(pd) if f.startswith(&#39;read_&#39;)], columns=[&#39;function&#39;]) . function . 0 read_clipboard | . 1 read_csv | . 2 read_excel | . 3 read_feather | . 4 read_fwf | . 5 read_gbq | . 6 read_hdf | . 7 read_html | . 8 read_json | . 9 read_orc | . 10 read_parquet | . 11 read_pickle | . 12 read_sas | . 13 read_spss | . 14 read_sql | . 15 read_sql_query | . 16 read_sql_table | . 17 read_stata | . 18 read_table | .

            "title": "Easy Machine Learning with PyCaret",
            "content": "What is Pycaret . Pycaret is a new machine learning library that simplifies machine learning workflows. It is a high level library that sits on top of the most popular ML libraries - including general purpose libraries such as scikit-learn, tree-based such as lightgbm, xgboost and catboost, and NLP libraries such as nltk, gensim and spacy. In a sense pycaret shifts the focus from the implementation of mathematical algorithms to the implementation of ML workflow algorithms. Some of pycaret&#39;s functions, such as setup, create_model, predict_model, plot_model, are meant to perform a part of a typical data science project, while abstracting away from how the actual libraries underneath operate. . In this sense it is a little bit like build tools Maven and Gradle, tools that did not really care how the underlying tools in your project operated but focused instead on the workflow of producing build artifacts at the end. It is more of an ML workflow library with a set of opinionated workflow algorithms that guide how a data science project is created. . If you recall Maven artifacts are written in the scripting language most familiar to developers at the time - XML. Jupyter notebooks have the same familiarity for data scientists now - most data scientists use them. Pycaret is unapologetically intended for use in Jupyter notebooks - several of the functions output data to be displayed in a notebook as the data science project is being created. So for example, - when you load using get_data - it displays the data that was loaded in the notebook. This makes use of the IPython.display. Pycaret also uses ipywidgets to show tabs or other UI elements useful to assist a data scientist while working on a data science project. This is familiar to me - I have written a few Jupyter first libraries of my own . Getting Started . To get started install pycaret. In the best case scenario it&#39;s a simple as . pip install pycaret . For more details go to the Pycaret Install page . Included Datasets . Pycaret includes several datasets to get started with. To use the included data, import the datasets package from pycaret. . from pycaret.datasets import get_data . Included with pycaret is a small dataset called juice. This small dataset has information about 1070 purchases of Citrus Hill or Minute Maid orange juice. It is originally meant for R projects and so is hosted on rdrr.io, a site where searching for R related packages and data. Because the data is small, it is conveniently included in the pycaret library. . To get the data use the get_data function. This conveniently also displays the data in the notebook. . juice_dataset = get_data(&#39;juice&#39;) . Id Purchase WeekofPurchase StoreID PriceCH PriceMM DiscCH DiscMM SpecialCH SpecialMM LoyalCH SalePriceMM SalePriceCH PriceDiff Store7 PctDiscMM PctDiscCH ListPriceDiff STORE . 0 1 | CH | 237 | 1 | 1.75 | 1.99 | 0.00 | 0.0 | 0 | 0 | 0.500000 | 1.99 | 1.75 | 0.24 | No | 0.000000 | 0.000000 | 0.24 | 1 | . 1 2 | CH | 239 | 1 | 1.75 | 1.99 | 0.00 | 0.3 | 0 | 1 | 0.600000 | 1.69 | 1.75 | -0.06 | No | 0.150754 | 0.000000 | 0.24 | 1 | . 2 3 | CH | 245 | 1 | 1.86 | 2.09 | 0.17 | 0.0 | 0 | 0 | 0.680000 | 2.09 | 1.69 | 0.40 | No | 0.000000 | 0.091398 | 0.23 | 1 | . 3 4 | MM | 227 | 1 | 1.69 | 1.69 | 0.00 | 0.0 | 0 | 0 | 0.400000 | 1.69 | 1.69 | 0.00 | No | 0.000000 | 0.000000 | 0.00 | 1 | . 4 5 | CH | 228 | 7 | 1.69 | 1.69 | 0.00 | 0.0 | 0 | 0 | 0.956535 | 1.69 | 1.69 | 0.00 | Yes | 0.000000 | 0.000000 | 0.00 | 0 | . The data seems complete and mostly numeric. The only weird thing about the data is that Id column, which we do not need because pandas generates an index for us. So let&#39;s drop it. . if &#39;Id&#39; in juice_dataset: juice_dataset = juice_dataset.set_index(&#39;Id&#39;) . Get Data Niceties . The get_data function has a couple of nice options. With save you can save a copy of the data in the local filesystem. With profile you can output a pandas profile report. You can see more details about get_data by running get_data?? in a code cell . Pandas Profiling Report . When you include the profile parameter get_data will output a pandas_profiling report created using the pandas_profile library. This gives a lot of information about the dataset and its features. Normally this helps in the data exploration phase of a data science project, but it&#39;s nice to also have it included in a function to get data. . . More about the orange juice dataset . We can find out more about the juice dataset by visiting the webpage at rdrr.io. Aternatively, we can grab the html from the site and convert the data description into a pandas dataframe. For this we will use a requests and BeautifulSoup. Here is that code. . #collapse import pandas as pd from bs4 import BeautifulSoup import requests pd.options.display.max_colwidth = 120 # 1. Grab the HTML from the website r = requests.get(&#39;https://rdrr.io/cran/ISLR/man/OJ.html&#39;) # 2. And convert it to a BeautifulSoup object soup = BeautifulSoup(r.text) def find_cells(soup, element): for dl in soup.find_all(&#39;dl&#39;): for dt in dl.find_all(&#39;dt&#39;): # 3. Once we find the &lt;dt&gt; element return it along with the &lt;dd&gt; element yield dt.text.strip(), dt.nextSibling.text.strip().replace(&#39; n&#39;, &#39; &#39;) # 4. Convert the generator to a list of tuples dt = list(find_cells(soup, &#39;dt&#39;)) # 5. Now create a dataframe from the list of tuples pd.DataFrame(dt, columns=[&#39;Feature&#39;,&#39;Description&#39;]).style.hide_index() . . Feature Description .

PctDiscCH | Percentage discount for CH | . ListPriceDiff | List price of MM less list price of CH | . STORE | Which of 5 possible stores the sale occured at | . Preparing Data . First, we split the data into training and test set. It is a small dataset and maybe we can get by with an 80/20 split, especially since we will use tree based algorithms or similar algorithms that can handle small datasets. . train = juice_dataset.sample(frac=0.80) unseen_data = juice_dataset.drop(train.index).reset_index(drop=True) train.shape, test.shape . ((856, 18), (214, 18)) . The setup function . At the heart of Pycaret has a powerful machine learning pipeline that takes the input data and performs a huge part of the traditional data processing workflow. This pipeline is started by calling the setup function. setup initializes the environment, and creates the data transformation pipeline to prepare the data for model training. . It is a bit of a magic function - a lot of work is done inside this function and it has to be called before any of the pycaret model development is started. You call setup on your training data and tell it the target variable, and it will start preparing for model training. Importantly, it does some of the work that data scientists would be doing manually at this point, including making decisions about some of the preprocessing steps, such as apply PCA, or removing outliers etc. How well it does this is yet to be seen but it is certainly a big change to a data scientist&#39;s workflow if this can be done automatically. A lt of steps are done automatically by pycaret, as we will see later. . Regardless, setup displays a dataframe with information it discovers about the data&#39;s features and includes some of the decisions that were taken. This give a nice platform for ML modeling. . from pycaret.classification import * juice_prep = setup(train, target=&#39;Purchase&#39;) . Setup Succesfully Completed! .

Compare Models . Once the data is prepared, a data scientist would now choose among candidate models. Again, there is another magic function compare_models which does this for you. This runs several models - 15 as shown below - on the data , and display key metrics to allow ypu to choose among the model types for the next step. . compare_models() .

Another nice feature that pycaret provides is the ability to plot different charts that can tell you how your model performs. For our ridge classifier we can plot a Precision-Recall Curve using plot_model(plot=&#39;pr&#39;). There are many different types of plots and it would be cool to try them out. . plot_model(ridge_tuned, plot = &#39;pr&#39;) . Predict . Finally, when we call predict_model pycaret runs the predictions and appends the labels to the original data. . unseen_predictions = predict_model(ridge_tuned, data=unseen_data) unseen_predictions[[&#39;Purchase&#39;, &#39;Label&#39;]] .

            "title": "Building a COVID-19 Research Engine",
            "content": ". This notebook contains a library called the CORD Research Engine, which uses search and NLP technology to simplify searching the CORD Research Paper dataset for information that would help solve the current pandemic&quot; . Getting Started . Data files . The CORD-19 dataset on Kaggle contains over 59,000 research papers. This notebook references about 2,000 of those papers, located in the directory data. Inside the data directory, the CORD Research data is located in the CORD-19-research-challenge subdirectory. For the full dataset please see the competition page on Kaggle. . Navigating the data . The original notebook was a Python kernel on Kaggle. On kaggle the data directory is /kaggle/input and when you launch a new notebook you are given a block of code to view the data in the directory. . import os for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk(&#39;/kaggle/input&#39;): for filename in filenames: print(os.path.join(dirname, filename)) . The Data Directory . Instead of the code above we will use pathlib for navigating the filesystem because it is a little bit easier to use than os.path. From pathlib we will use the Path and PurePath classes. The Path class provides almost all the functionality we need except that it cannot be passed directly into _pandas.readcsv as can be done with the PurePath. . Now we can create a Path object at the location of the CORD research data and view the contents of that directory. . from pathlib import Path, PurePath data_path = Path(&#39;data/CORD-19-research-challenge&#39;) list(data_path.glob(&#39;*&#39;)) . [WindowsPath(&#39;data/CORD-19-research-challenge/biorxiv_medrxiv&#39;), WindowsPath(&#39;data/CORD-19-research-challenge/comm_use_subset&#39;), WindowsPath(&#39;data/CORD-19-research-challenge/cord_19_embeddings.csv&#39;), WindowsPath(&#39;data/CORD-19-research-challenge/custom_license&#39;), WindowsPath(&#39;data/CORD-19-research-challenge/metadata.csv&#39;), WindowsPath(&#39;data/CORD-19-research-challenge/noncomm_use_subset&#39;)] . The CORD-19 data directory contains four sub-directories, the JSON contents of the research papers, and a metadata.csv file with the metadata for all the research papers. For the actual details of the CORD Research papers dataset, see the description on the Kaggle site. . Research Engine Design . A tale of two indexes . We will build two indexes into the data: one for search, and one for similarity. An index is just a data structure that provides a way to sort some data. In our case, for search, we want to provide a search term to the index and have it return a list of the research papers, sorted by most relevant to the search term. . With the similarity index, the goal is to provide a research paper as input and have the index return a list of papers sorted by the most similar to that paper. . In the real world, and for applications that you may write, you may encounter those two use cases, so we will show the best techniques to fulfill the requirements. Search and Similarity are related but not identical areas, and both the indexes we will build are better at one than the other. . Object-Oriented Design . An object-oriented design is rarely used with notebooks, and for good reason. A notebook is a hybrid of a Python script and a layout template, which both operate in a top to bottom way. Objects are usually meant to be defined in a certain location or context and interacted with multiple times during the course of a program. This is exactly what we want to do here; we intend to create a Research Engine and use it to find research papers during the course of a single session. . There are two main objects in our design: ResearchPapers and Paper. The ResearchPapers class will load and maintain the list of research papers, while Paper will allow us to work with a single research paper. . class ResearchPapers: def __init__(self, metadata, data_dir=&#39;data&#39;): pass class Paper: def __init__(self): pass . Loading Research Papers . We start with the metadata.csv since this contains the master list of all the research papers and important information about each paper. Some Kaggle kernels started by loading the research papers from the JSON files, but the metadata is considerably smaller, and starting with the metadata might allow us to only load a research paper from a JSON file if required, thereby saving significantly on computational resources. . Load Metadata . The load_metadata function is straightforward - it uses pandas.read_csv() to load the metadata.csv file. Along the way it changes the data types for the Microsoft Academic Paper ID and _pubmedid columns. It also renames a couple of columns, which is optional, and only to make browsing the data a little easier. . @staticmethod def load_metadata(data_path=None): if not data_path: data_path = find_data_dir() print(&#39;Loading metadata from&#39;, data_path) metadata_path = PurePath(data_path) / &#39;metadata.csv&#39; dtypes = {&#39;Microsoft Academic Paper ID&#39;: &#39;str&#39;, &#39;pubmed_id&#39;: str} renames = {&#39;source_x&#39;: &#39;source&#39;, &#39;has_full_text&#39;: &#39;has_text&#39;} # Load the metadata using read.csv metadata = pd.read_csv(metadata_path, dtype=dtypes, low_memory=False, parse_dates=[&#39;publish_time&#39;]).rename(columns=renames) metadata = clean_metadata(metadata) return metadata . Within load_metadata we call clean_metadata. This function is a data cleaning pipeline that fixes some of the issues with the Kaggle data by using a pipeline of data cleaning functions. Notice that each function is specfic to a task, and named specifically for that task, which makes it simple to remove or add cleaning functions. This is important since a new version of the CORD research data is released every week, with new data fixes, so if you can quickly modify your data pipeline, it gives you an advantage. . Clean Metadata . def clean_metadata(metadata): print(&#39;Cleaning metadata&#39;) return metadata.pipe(start) .pipe(clean_title) .pipe(clean_abstract) .pipe(rename_publish_time) .pipe(add_date_diff) .pipe(drop_missing) .pipe(fill_nulls) .pipe(apply_tags) . Each function in the clean_metadata pipeline accepts a dataframe and returns the dataframe after modification. The functions are connected by the pandas dataframe pipe function, which is designed for this use case of connecting functions sequentially. At the start of the pipeline is a special function called start which is defined as: . def start(data): return data.copy() . This returns a copy of the data at the start of a data pipeline. This is very important; it makes sure that the initial data is unchanged and enables you to rerun your notebook from any point without worrying that your data has changed in a way that breaks it. This is a pattern I learned from the presentation Untitled12.ipynb by Vincent D Warmerdam at PyData Eindhoven 2019 . Each subsequent function in the pipeline accepts a dataframe and returns a dataframe. Here is clean_title: . def clean_title(data): # Set junk titles to &#39;&#39; title_relevant = data.title.fillna(&#39;&#39;).str.match(_relevant_re_, case=False) title_short = data.title.fillna(&#39;&#39;).apply(len) &lt; 30 title_junk = title_short &amp; ~title_relevant data.loc[title_junk, &#39;title&#39;] = &#39;&#39; return data . Load function . After loading the metadata, we have the load function. This is the static function on the ResearchPapers class that actually creates the ResearchPapers instance using ResearchPapers.load(). . @classmethod def load(cls, index=None): data_path = find_data_dir() metadata = cls.load_metadata(data_path) return cls(metadata, data_path, index=index) . Preprocessing . While the clean_metadata function does some text preprocessing, it does that in relation to the metadata.csv file that is released by Kaggle to remove any data issues it might have. We still need to do text preprocessing to prepare the text of the research papers for storing in the search and similarity indexes. Text preprocessing is a necessary part of NLP projects, and, despite the fact that there are a lot of utilities available in NLP libraries to preprocess test, it is still part of the art of being an NLP practictioner. For example, the regex below was hand-crafted with input from Google searches, and a lot of trial and error. I found, for example, that the text prepeocessing that came with gensim was hand-rolled. You may or may not need to follow a similar process for your own text preprocessing, depending on your judgement. . TOKEN_PATTERN = re.compile(&#39;^(20|19) d{2}|(?=[A-Z])[ w - d]+$&#39;, re.IGNORECASE) def replace_punctuation(text): t = re.sub(&#39; (| )|:|,|;| .|’|”|“| ?|%|&gt;|&lt;|≥|≤|~|`&#39;, &#39;&#39;, text) t = re.sub(&#39;/&#39;, &#39; &#39;, t) t = t.replace(&quot;&#39;&quot;, &#39;&#39;) return t def clean(text): t = text.lower() t = replace_punctuation(t) return t def tokenize(text): words = nltk.word_tokenize(text) return [word for word in words if len(word) &gt; 1 and not word in SIMPLE_STOPWORDS and TOKEN_PATTERN.match(word) ] def preprocess(text): t = clean(text) tokens = tokenize(t) return tokens . The preprocess function . Regardless, every NLP project requires a preprocess or equivalent function. Our preprocess function converts the text to lowercase, removes punctuation, and converts the text to tokens. What is very important is that the identical preprocess function be used when preparing the text in batch mode as when using it in query mode. So the preprocess function will be used again on each search query to match accurately against what is stored in the index. . Utility Functions . Parallel Processing . As of the May 2nd data release the CORD Research Paper dataset was over 8GB in size, with more than 59,000 metadata records and well over 60,000 research papers on disk. In order to process the data in a reasonable amount of time, we added a utility function that will run a given function on a list of data using as many cores that are available. . def parallel(func, arr: Collection, max_workers: int = None, leave=False): &quot;Call `func` on every element of `arr` in parallel using `max_workers`.&quot; max_workers = ifnone(max_workers, multiprocessing.cpu_count()) progress_bar = tqdm(arr) with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=max_workers) as ex: futures_to_index = {ex.submit(func, o): i for i, o in enumerate(arr)} results = [] for f in as_completed(futures_to_index): results.append((futures_to_index[f], f.result())) progress_bar.update() for n in range(progress_bar.n, progress_bar.total): time.sleep(0.1) progress_bar.update() results.sort(key=lambda x: x[0]) return [result for i, result in results] . For example, if we have a list of JSON files and we want to convert that to a ist of tokenized text we can do: . def get_tokens(cord_path): cord_uid, path = cord_path if isinstance(path, Path): tokens = preprocess(load_text(path)) return cord_uid, tokens return cord_uid, np.nan cord_tokens = parallel(get_tokens, cord_paths) . Reading and tokenizing each of the over 60,000 JSON files is a very expensive operation, so we want to distribute this load across our CPU cores. . Describe the Metadata . The pandas function describe can be used to gather information about series and dataframes. . This is what describe shows when you use it on the metadata without doing any special type of conversions. . import pandas as pd metadata = pd.read_csv(PurePath(data_path) / &#39;metadata.csv&#39;) metadata.describe() . pubmed_id Microsoft Academic Paper ID . count 1.404000e+03 | 3.600000e+01 | . mean 2.214187e+07 | 2.706621e+09 | . std 7.717728e+06 | 4.306890e+08 | . min 2.700200e+04 | 1.559092e+09 | . 25% 1.726375e+07 | 2.315523e+09 | . 50% 2.375861e+07 | 3.003704e+09 | . 75% 2.839937e+07 | 3.004938e+09 | . max 3.230300e+07 | 3.006646e+09 | . It is a bit limiting, so we will write a function that provides more information than what is available using describe. . from cord.core import describe_dataframe describe_dataframe(metadata); . ResearchPapers init . Now we are at ResearchPapers.__init__(). The ResearchPapers instance is constructed with a metadata dataframe, which is the dataframe we parsed in load_metadata. A ResearchPapers instance can also be constructed with a subset of the metadata, meaning that we can create an instance containing only COVID-19 related papers, or papers published by Elsevier or any other subset of the metadata that we are interested in. We will show how to use this functionality later. . We can construct the BM25 index from the papers referenced by the metadata. Each metadata row has an abstract column, which contains the abstract of the research paper, which we can preprocess into the index tokens needed by the index. We can, alternatively, create the index tokens from the full text content of the paper, which we load from disk. The full text content gives the potential for a more accurate search, with the tradeoff that it takes a much longer time to build the index. To enable this tradeoff, the load function accepts a parameter index, which deteremines which index strategy to use. ResearchPapers.load(index=&quot;text&quot;) loaded and indexed from the JSON file contents, while ResearchPapers.load(index&quot;abstract&quot;) used the metadata abstract. On a Kaggle instance it took approximately 100 seconds to index from the abstracts versus over 2,000 seconds to index from the JSON texts, though it was about three times faster for each operation on my local laptop. . To save on the time to load from the JSON texts the CORD library, JSON index tokens were processed offline and saved to parquet files. These parquet files were then loaded whenever the option index=&quot;text&quot; was selected. . def __init__(self, metadata, data_dir=&#39;data&#39;, index=&#39;abstract&#39;, view=&#39;html&#39;): self.data_path = Path(data_dir) self.num_results = 10 self.view = view self.metadata = metadata if &#39;index_tokens&#39; not in metadata: print(&#39; nIndexing research papers&#39;) if any([index == t for t in [&#39;text&#39;, &#39;texts&#39;, &#39;content&#39;, &#39;contents&#39;]]): tick = time.time() _set_index_from_text(self.metadata, data_dir) print(&quot;Finished indexing in&quot;, int(time.time() - tick), &#39;seconds&#39;) else: print(&#39;Creating the BM25 index from the abstracts of the papers&#39;) print(&#39;Use index=&quot;text&quot; if you want to index the texts of the paper instead&#39;) tick = time.time() self.metadata[&#39;index_tokens&#39;] = metadata.abstract.apply(preprocess) tock = time.time() print(&#39;Finished Indexing in&#39;, round(tock - tick, 0), &#39;seconds&#39;) # Create BM25 search index self.bm25 = _get_bm25Okapi(self.metadata.index_tokens) . Python Objects wrapping dataframes . A pattern that is repeated throughout the project is to have a dataframe as a member of a python object. The python object controls access to the dataframe and provides useful functionality, while the dataframe acts as a local database. There are many use cases that fit this pattern where you load read-only data into a dataframe and wrap python code around it. In our case the ResearchPapers class acts like a miniature application that accesses a local in-memory database. We also do this with the SearchResults object, which wraps a dataframe of the search results. . The most important line above self.metadata = metadata sets the dataframe as an instance member. The primary use is to load all the research papers from the metadata.csv, in which case we will have all 50,000+ research papers. Note that we can pass a metadata dataframe of any number of records, meaning that we can make subsets of ResearchPapers. This enables the ability to select only a subset of research papers, e.g. source==&quot;Elsevier&quot;, then make a copy of the ResearchPapers with the smaller number of records. . def query(self, query): data = self.metadata.query(query) return self._make_copy(data) def _make_copy(self, new_data): return ResearchPapers(metadata=new_data.copy(), data_dir=self.data_path, view=self.view) . We will see how this pattern is used in more detail later in the notebook. . Indexing Research Papers . Now that we have completed our basic code, we can see the load in action. We will start with loading from the abstracts. . from cord import ResearchPapers . Indexing from Abstracts . papers = ResearchPapers.load() .

The Search Index . The search index is built on a BM25 Okapi libray called _rankbm25. . An implementation of BM25 is also available in gensim, but I found _rankbm25 was simple to implement. . rank_bm25 | Dorian Brown (author of rank_bm25) | . What is BM25 Okapi? . BM25 stands for Best Match the 25th version and is a text search algorithm first developed in 1994. Okapi stands for the Okapi information retrieval system, implemented at London&#39;s City University in the 1980s and 1990s on which BM25 was used. . It is one of the best search algorithms available, and Lucene and its derivatives, Solr and ElasticSearch switched to a BM25 variant around 2015. . Creating the BM25 Index . The heart of this notebook, the one forked over 400 times on Kaggle, is this line of code. . BM25Okapi(index_tokens.tolist()) . This creates a new BM25Okapi index on the index_tokens. The index accepts a list of tokens, with each item in the list representing a single tokenized research paper. This is as simple as you can get for a bit of technology that is also used in ElasticSearch software. . The actual implementation in the library is just slightly more complicated, accounting for the edge case of creating a ResearchPapers instance with no papers inside. (This can happen, as we see below, if our API is so flexible that it allows a user to do this). . from rank_bm25 import BM25Okapi def _get_bm25Okapi(index_tokens): has_tokens = index_tokens.apply(len).sum() &gt; 0 if not has_tokens: index_tokens.loc[0] = [&#39;no&#39;, &#39;tokens&#39;] return BM25Okapi(index_tokens.tolist()) . Searching Papers . The search function is defined below. We preprocess the search string and then get the doc_scores (the search relevance score) from the BM25 index for all documents in the index. Then we get the dataframe locations of the most relevant papers, do some additional filtering, then return the top n results. . def search(self, search_string, num_results=10, covid_related=False, start_date=None, end_date=None, view=&#39;html&#39;): n_results = num_results or self.num_results # Preprocess the search string search_terms = preprocess(search_string) # Get the doc scores from the BM25 index doc_scores = self.bm25.get_scores(search_terms) # Get the index from the doc scores sorted by most relevant ind = np.argsort(doc_scores)[::-1] # Sort the metadata using the sorted index above results = self.metadata.iloc[ind].copy() # Round the doc scores, in case we use the score in the display results[&#39;Score&#39;] = doc_scores[ind].round(1) # Filter covid related if covid_related: results = results[results.covid_related] # Filter by dates - start date if start_date: results = results[results.published &gt;= start_date] # end data if end_date: results = results[results.published &lt; end_date] # Show only up to n_results results = results.head(num_results) # Create the final results results = results.drop_duplicates(subset=[&#39;title&#39;]) # Return Search Results return SearchResults(results, self.data_path, view=view) . Here is the code run outside of the function, with print statements . from cord.text import preprocess import numpy as np search_query = &#39;Mother to child transmission&#39; search_tokens = preprocess(search_query) print(&#39;search_tokens&#39;, search_tokens) doc_scores = papers.bm25.get_scores(search_tokens) print(&#39;doc_scores&#39;, doc_scores) ind = np.argsort(doc_scores)[::-1] print(&#39;ind&#39;, ind) . search_tokens [&#39;mother&#39;, &#39;child&#39;, &#39;transmission&#39;] doc_scores [0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.] ind [1451 1543 82 ... 1320 1322 0] . The Similarity Index . Included with the CORD-19 Research Dataset is a CSV file containing the document embeddings vectors for the papers in the dataset. Each vector is a 768-dimension vector representing what a neural network has learned about that research paper, and, effectively, it is a signature or a fingerprint of that research paper. This vector can be used to build our similarity index and allow us to find similar papers for any given research paper. . . The embeddings CSV file is large—over 700MB in the real dataset. For this notebook we have created a smaller CSV file with only the embeddings for the research papers included with the notebook. If you load and look at the embeddings, you will see 769 columns, one for each of the 768-dimension vector, plus the cord_uid. (The cord_uid is the unique identifier for a research paper in the dataset.) . embeddings_path = data_path / &#39;cord_19_embeddings.csv&#39; embeddings = pd.read_csv(embeddings_path) display(embeddings.shape) ## Look at the first 2 rows and 5 columns embeddings.iloc[:2, :5] .

Building the Annoy Index . Annoy is a library for building an index of vectors so that the nearest neighbors to that vector can be easily found. This library is used at Spotify to find music recommendations, so it is one of the best technologies we can possibly use to find similar papers. . To build an annoy index, you first create it with the vector size that you want to store in the index, then add each vector to the index, then build. . from annoy import AnnoyIndex import random VECTOR_SIZE = 40 annoy_index = AnnoyIndex(VECTOR_SIZE, &#39;angular&#39;) # Length of item vector that will be indexed for i, vector in enumerate(vectors): annoy_index.add_item(i, vector) annoy_index.build(10) # 10 trees annoy_index.save(&#39;test.ann&#39;) . Reduce Vector Dimensions . For the index we wanted to create, we thought 768 dimensions was too much, especially since it meant that the resulting index would be very large on disk, and also too large to fit into a Git repository. Therefore we used PCA to reduce the dimensions to 192, and those 192 dimensional vectors are stored in the Annoy Index. . from sklearn.decomposition import PCA def downsample(docvectors, dimensions=2): print(f&#39;Downsampling to {dimensions}D embeddings&#39;) pca = PCA(n_components=dimensions, svd_solver=&#39;full&#39;) docvectors_downsampled = pca.fit_transform(docvectors) return np.squeeze(docvectors_downsampled), pca . Getting Similar Vectors . Once we have the annoy index, we use it to find similar papers using the similar papers function. Annoy has two functions for finding similar papers: get_nns_by_item and get_nns_by_vector. In our function we use get_nns_by_item. . def similar_papers(paper_id, num_items=config.num_similar_items): from .vectors import SPECTOR_SIMILARITY_INDEX index = paper_id if isinstance(paper_id, int) else get_index(paper_id) if not index: return [] similar_indexes = SPECTOR_SIMILARITY_INDEX.get_nns_by_item(index, num_items, search_k=config.search_k) similar_cord_uids = document_vectors.iloc[similar_indexes].index.values.tolist() return [id for id in similar_cord_uids if not id == paper_id] . Displaying objects in a notebook . In the search function we returned a SearchResults object that contained a dataframe with the search results. This is a common pattern used in the notebook—often a dataframe is wrapped inside of an object. . The reason for this pattern is to control how the dataframe is displayed in the notebook. For the search result, we want to present a different formatting from what is available for dataframes, and we may also want to control which columns are displayed, or other aspects of the search results. . Outputting HTML . Objects can control how they are displayed as HTML in a Jupyter notebook by implementing the _repr_html_() function. Some of the objects that we create in this project are meant to wrap a dataframe and control how they are displayed. SearchResults is one such object—it wraps the results dataframe and controls how it looks using _repr_html_(). SearchResults can actually be viewed as a dataframe . papers.search(&#39;Mother to child&#39;, covid_related=True, num_results=4, view=&#39;df&#39;) . title summary when . 1451 Investigation on demands for antenatal care se... | Objective To identify problems and demands for... | 4 months ago | . 664 Lessons learned from Korea: COVID-19 pandemic | Lessons learned from Korea: COVID-19 pandemic | 1 month ago | . 642 Editorial.

Using the Dataframe style function . Another great way to customize the look of a dataframe inside a notebook is to use the dataframe.style function. This pandas functionality is pretty powerful and can allow you to completely change how a dataframe is displayed in a notebook. . In the CORD library we wanted to style the results differently from regular dataframes, to improve on the look and feel, and to have the library stand out from the competition. The code below shows how the display function used the style function to change the styling of the results. . def display(self, *paper_ids): # Look up the papers using the paperids and create a dataframe _recs = [] for id in paper_ids: paper = self[id] _recs.append({&#39;published&#39;: paper.metadata.published, &#39;title&#39;: paper.title, &#39;summary&#39;: paper.summary, &#39;when&#39;: paper.metadata.when, &#39;cord_uid&#39;: paper.cord_uid}) df = pd.DataFrame(_recs).sort_values([&#39;published&#39;], ascending=False).drop(columns=[&#39;published&#39;]) # Apply a style to a column def highlight_cols(s): return &#39;font-size: 1.1em; color: #008B8B; font-weight: bold&#39; # Apply the style above to the title column of the dataframe and hide the index return df.style.applymap(highlight_cols, subset=pd.IndexSlice[:, [&#39;title&#39;]]).hide_index() . This is how the results are dispayed in the notebook: . papers.display(&#39;v3lbrzh8&#39;) . title summary when cord_uid . Biochemical evidence for the presence of mixed membrane topologies of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus envelope protein expressed in mammalian cells | Different coronavirus E proteins share striking similarities in biochemical properties and biological functions, but seem to adopt distinct membrane topology. In this report, we study the membrane topology of the SARS-CoV E protein by immunofluorescent staining of cells differentially permeabilized with detergents and proteinase K protection assay. It was revealed that both the N- and C-termini of the SARS-CoV E protein are exposed to the cytoplasmic side of the membranes (NcytoCcyto). Intriguingly, a minor proportion of the SARS-CoV E protein was found to be modified by N-linked glycosylation on Asn 66 and inserted into the membranes once with the C-terminus exposed to the luminal side. The presence of two distinct membrane topologies of the SARS-CoV E protein may provide a useful clue to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV. | 14 years ago | v3lbrzh8 | . For more information on styling dataframes see Pandas Styling. . Creating Search Widgets . To create interactivity within the notebook, and to allow the user to perform interactive searches, we use ipywidgets. . Search Date Slider . This widget displays a slider that allows a user to select relevant dates for the Research paper search: . def SearchDatesSlider(): options = [(&#39; 1951 &#39;, &#39;1951-01-01&#39;), (&#39; SARS 2003 &#39;, &#39;2002-11-01&#39;), (&#39; H1N1 2009 &#39;, &#39;2009-04-01&#39;), (&#39; COVID 19 &#39;, &#39;2019-11-30&#39;), (&#39; 2020 &#39;, &#39;2020-12-31&#39;)] return widgets.SelectionRangeSlider( options=options, description=&#39;Dates&#39;, disabled=False, value=(&#39;2002-11-01&#39;, &#39;2020-12-31&#39;), layout={&#39;width&#39;: &#39;480px&#39;} ) . SearchBar . For the search bar we add a Text, Button, Checkbox and use HBox and VBox for layout. . def searchbar(self, initial_search_terms=&#39;&#39;, num_results=10, view=None): text_input = widgets.Text(layout=widgets.Layout(width=&#39;400px&#39;), value=initial_search_terms) search_button = widgets.Button(description=&#39;Search&#39;, button_style=&#39;primary&#39;, layout=widgets.Layout(width=&#39;100px&#39;)) search_box = widgets.HBox(children=[text_input, search_button]) # A COVID-related checkbox covid_related_CheckBox = widgets.Checkbox(description=&#39;Covid-19 related&#39;, value=False, disable=False) checkboxes = widgets.HBox(children=[covid_related_CheckBox]) # A date slider to limit research papers to a date range search_dates_slider = SearchDatesSlider() search_widget = widgets.VBox([search_box, search_dates_slider, checkboxes]) output = widgets.Output() def do_search(): search_terms = text_input.value.strip() if search_terms and len(search_terms) &gt;= 4: start_date, end_date = search_dates_slider.value self._search_papers(output=output, SearchTerms=search_terms, num_results=num_results, view=view, start_date=start_date, end_date=end_date, covid_related=covid_related_CheckBox.value) def button_search_handler(btn): with output: clear_output() do_search() def text_search_handler(change): if len(change[&#39;new&#39;].split(&#39; &#39;)) != len(change[&#39;old&#39;].split(&#39; &#39;)): do_search() def date_handler(change): do_search() def checkbox_handler(change): do_search() search_button.on_click(button_search_handler) text_input.observe(text_search_handler, names=&#39;value&#39;) search_dates_slider.observe(date_handler, names=&#39;value&#39;) covid_related_CheckBox.observe(checkbox_handler, names=&#39;value&#39;) display(search_widget) display(output) # Show the initial terms if initial_search_terms: do_search() . Now we can see the search bar in action. It updates as you change the selections in the form . papers.searchbar(&#39;Cruise ship&#39;, num_results=4) . . Subsetting Research Papers . There are many ways to select subsets of research papers including: .

Summary . : Tripeptidyl-peptidase I, also known as CLN2, is a member of the family of sedolisins (serine-carboxyl peptidases). Similar enzymes have been found in the genomic sequences of several species, but neither systematic analyses of their distribution nor modeling of their structures have been previously attempted. RESULTS: We have analyzed the presence of orthologs of human CLN2 in the genomic sequences of a number of eukaryotic species. Enzymes with sequences sharing over 80% identity have been found in the genomes of macaque, mouse, rat, dog, and cow. A three-dimensional model of human CLN2 was built based mainly on the homology with Pseudomonas sp. The model presented here indicates a very open and accessible active site that is almost completely conserved among all known CLN2 enzymes. It&#39;s preferable to access a paper using the cord_uid since it is a stable identifier. papers[&quot;5o38ihe0&quot;] referes to the same research paper . papers[&#39;5o38ihe0&#39;] .

The implementation of __getitem__() is simple: . def __getitem__(self, item): if isinstance(item, int): paper = self.metadata.iloc[item] else: paper = self.metadata[self.metadata.cord_uid == item] . The main view of a research paper is the overview, as shown above. This shows a formatted collection of the paper&#39;s important fields. There are other views or attributes of research papers, including: . Overview: A nicely formatted view of the paper&#39;s important fields | Abstract: The paper&#39;s abstract | Summary: A summary of the paper&#39;s abstract using the TextRank algorithm | Text: The text in the paper | HTML: The contents of the paper as somewhat nicely formatted HTML | Text Summary: The text of the paper, summarized using the TextRank algorithm | . This is implemented in the following function: . paper = research_papers[&#39;asf5c7xu&#39;] def view_paper(ViewPaperAs): if ViewPaperAs == &#39;Overview&#39;: display(paper) elif ViewPaperAs == &#39;Abstract&#39;: display(paper.abstract) elif ViewPaperAs == &#39;Summary of Abstract&#39;: display(paper.summary) elif ViewPaperAs == &#39;HTML&#39;: display(paper.html) elif ViewPaperAs == &#39;Text&#39;: display(paper.text) elif ViewPaperAs == &#39;Summary of Text&#39;: display(paper.text_summary) interact(view_paper, ViewPaperAs=[&#39;Overview&#39;, # Show an overview of the paper&#39;s important fields and statistics &#39;Abstract&#39;, # Show the paper&#39;s abstract &#39;Summary of Abstract&#39;, # Show a summary of the paper&#39;s abstract &#39;HTML&#39;, # Show the paper&#39;s contents as (slightly) formatted HTML &#39;Text&#39;, # Show the paper&#39;s contents &#39;Summary of Text&#39; # Show a summary of the paper&#39;s content ] ); . Conclusion . In this notebook we showed you how to use search and NLP techniques to build a simple search engine and UI over a set of documents. Hopefully, it can help you create your own solution if you are interested in contributing to the same CORD research paper dataset. However, the code and techniques learned here can be applied to other use cases, so feel free to adapt it to your own purposes. . . References .

            "content": ". In The Metric We Need to Manage COVID-19, Kevin Systrom, who co-founded Instagram, wrote about $R_t$, a measure of the effective reproductive rate for COVID-19. You might have heard about R0 - the base reproductive rate, which is measure how many secondary infections are produced by a single primary infection. If R0 is greater that 1, the disease spreads, while if it is less than 1, it will eventually peter out. . $R_t$ is an improvement over R0, since it changes in response to health interventions, which makes it a metric we can actually track to see how well we are doing. The techniques for calculating it are based on Bayesian probability, whic is best explained by referring to the original blog post, or his notebook, or his follow up posts on the topic. . This post extends on his notebook, which caululated $R_t$ for the states in the US, by calculating $R_t$ for Canada. What follows is mostly his original noteboo, with his explanations, except where I have made some changes to swap in Canadian data, or to make editorial comments. .

Get Canadian Data . To start, we will load the data for Canadian provinces from the Johns Hopkins CSSE repository, and transform it to match nthe data format in Kevin&#39;s notebook. .

From wide to long . The data is originally in wide format, which means that each new day is a new column, and so the data will stretch as wide as there are days. Converting from wide to long data format will frequently be a data processing step that you are required to do as a data scientist. Here we are showing the first 10 columns of the dataset. . You will also notice that it contains Grand Princess and Diamond Princess, which are two cruise ships that were early sources of COVID19 infections in Canada. We will remove those later, along with Recovered, which we don&#39;t need since we are only looking at provinces. . canada_wide.iloc[:, :10].style.hide_index() .

Taking a look at the state, we need to start the analysis when there are a consistent number of cases each day. Find the last zero new case day and start on the day after that. . Also, case reporting is very erratic based on testing backlogs, etc. To get the best view of the &#39;true&#39; data we can, I&#39;ve applied a gaussian filter to the time series. This is obviously an arbitrary choice, but you&#39;d imagine the real world process is not nearly as stochastic as the actual reporting. . And here is this process applied to Ontario&#39;s data. . province_name = &#39;Ontario&#39; def prepare_cases(cases, min_cases=MIN_CASES): new_cases = cases.diff() smoothed = new_cases.rolling(9, win_type=&#39;gaussian&#39;, min_periods=1, center=True).mean(std=3).round() idx_start = np.searchsorted(smoothed, min_cases) smoothed = smoothed.iloc[idx_start:] original = new_cases.loc[smoothed.index] return original, smoothed cases = provinces.xs(province_name).rename(f&quot;{province_name} cases&quot;) original, smoothed = prepare_cases(cases) original.plot(title=f&quot;{province_name} New Cases per Day&quot;, c=&#39;k&#39;, linestyle=&#39;:&#39;, alpha=.5, label=&#39;Actual&#39;, legend=True, figsize=(500/72, 400/72)) ax = smoothed.plot(label=&#39;Smoothed&#39;, legend=True) ax.get_figure().set_facecolor(&#39;w&#39;) . Running the Algorithm . Choosing the Gaussian $ sigma$ for $P(R_t|R_{t-1})$ . . Note: you can safely skip this section if you trust that we chose the right value of $ sigma$ for the process below. Otherwise, read on. The original approach simply selects yesterday&#39;s posterior as today&#39;s prior. While intuitive, doing so doesn&#39;t allow for our belief that the value of $R_t$ has likely changed from yesterday. To allow for that change, we apply Gaussian noise to the prior distribution with some standard deviation $ sigma$. The higher $ sigma$ the more noise and the more we will expect the value of $R_t$ to drift each day. Interestingly, applying noise on noise iteratively means that there will be a natural decay of distant posteriors. This approach has a similar effect of windowing, but is more robust and doesn&#39;t arbitrarily forget posteriors after a certain time like my previous approach. Specifically, windowing computed a fixed $R_t$ at each time $t$ that explained the surrounding $w$ days of cases, while the new approach computes a series of $R_t$ values that explains all the cases, assuming that $R_t$ fluctuates by about $ sigma$ each day. . However, there&#39;s still an arbitrary choice: what should $ sigma$ be? Adam Lerer pointed out that we can use the process of maximum likelihood to inform our choice. Here&#39;s how it works: . Maximum likelihood says that we&#39;d like to choose a $ sigma$ that maximizes the likelihood of seeing our data $k$: $P(k| sigma)$. Since $ sigma$ is a fixed value, let&#39;s leave it out of the notation, so we&#39;re trying to maximize $P(k)$ over all choices of $ sigma$. . Since $P(k)=P(k_0,k_1, ldots,k_t)=P(k_0)P(k_1) ldots P(k_t)$ we need to define $P(k_t)$. It turns out this is the denominator of Bayes rule: . $$P(R_t|k_t) = frac{P(k_t|R_t)P(R_t)}{P(k_t)}$$ . To calculate it, we notice that the numerator is actually just the joint distribution of $k$ and $R$: . $$ P(k_t,R_t) = P(k_t|R_t)P(R_t) $$ . We can marginalize the distribution over $R_t$ to get $P(k_t)$: . $$ P(k_t) = sum_{R_{t}}{P(k_t|R_t)P(R_t)} $$ . So, if we sum the distribution of the numerator over all values of $R_t$, we get $P(k_t)$. And since we&#39;re calculating that anyway as we&#39;re calculating the posterior, we&#39;ll just keep track of it separately. . Since we&#39;re looking for the value of $ sigma$ that maximizes $P(k)$ overall, we actually want to maximize: . $$ prod_{t,i}{p(k_{ti})}$$ . where $t$ are all times and $i$ is each state. . Since we&#39;re multiplying lots of tiny probabilities together, it can be easier (and less error-prone) to take the $ log$ of the values and add them together. Remember that $ log{ab}= log{a}+ log{b}$. And since logarithms are monotonically increasing, maximizing the sum of the $ log$ of the probabilities is the same as maximizing the product of the non-logarithmic probabilities for any choice of $ sigma$. . Function for Calculating the Posteriors . To calculate the posteriors we follow these steps: . Calculate $ lambda$ - the expected arrival rate for every day&#39;s poisson process | Calculate each day&#39;s likelihood distribution over all possible values of $R_t$ | Calculate the process matrix based on the value of $ sigma$ we discussed above | Calculate our initial prior because our first day does not have a previous day from which to take the posterior Based on info from the cdc we will choose a Gamma with mean 7. | . | Loop from day 1 to the end, doing the following: Calculate the prior by applying the Gaussian to yesterday&#39;s prior. | Apply Bayes&#39; rule by multiplying this prior and the likelihood we calculated in step 2. | Divide by the probability of the data (also Bayes&#39; rule) | . | def get_posteriors(sr, sigma=0.15): # (1) Calculate Lambda lam = sr[:-1].values * np.exp(GAMMA * (r_t_range[:, None] - 1)) # (2) Calculate each day&#39;s likelihood likelihoods = pd.DataFrame( data = sps.poisson.pmf(sr[1:].values, lam), index = r_t_range, columns = sr.index[1:]) # (3) Create the Gaussian Matrix process_matrix = sps.norm(loc=r_t_range, scale=sigma ).pdf(r_t_range[:, None]) # (3a) Normalize all rows to sum to 1 process_matrix /= process_matrix.sum(axis=0) # (4) Calculate the initial prior prior0 = sps.gamma(a=4).pdf(r_t_range) prior0 /= prior0.sum() # Create a DataFrame that will hold our posteriors for each day # Insert our prior as the first posterior. posteriors = pd.DataFrame( index=r_t_range, columns=sr.index, data={sr.index[0]: prior0} ) # We said we&#39;d keep track of the sum of the log of the probability # of the data for maximum likelihood calculation. log_likelihood = 0.0 # (5) Iteratively apply Bayes&#39; rule for previous_day, current_day in zip(sr.index[:-1], sr.index[1:]): #(5a) Calculate the new prior current_prior = process_matrix @ posteriors[previous_day] #(5b) Calculate the numerator of Bayes&#39; Rule: P(k|R_t)P(R_t) numerator = likelihoods[current_day] * current_prior #(5c) Calcluate the denominator of Bayes&#39; Rule P(k) denominator = np.sum(numerator) # Execute full Bayes&#39; Rule posteriors[current_day] = numerator/denominator # Add to the running sum of log likelihoods log_likelihood += np.log(denominator) return posteriors, log_likelihood # Note that we&#39;re fixing sigma to a value just for the example posteriors, log_likelihood = get_posteriors(smoothed, sigma=.25) . The Result . Below you can see every day (row) of the posterior distribution plotted simultaneously. The posteriors start without much confidence (wide) and become progressively more confident (narrower) about the true value of $R_t$ . ax = posteriors.plot(title=f&#39;{province_name} - Daily Posterior for $R_t$&#39;, legend=False, lw=1, c=&#39;k&#39;, alpha=.3, xlim=(0.4,6)) ax.set_xlabel(&#39;$R_t$&#39;); .

Choosing the optimal $ sigma$ . In the previous section we described choosing an optimal $ sigma$, but we just assumed a value. But now that we can evaluate each state with any sigma, we have the tools for choosing the optimal $ sigma$. . Above we said we&#39;d choose the value of $ sigma$ that maximizes the likelihood of the data $P(k)$. Since we don&#39;t want to overfit on any one state, we choose the sigma that maximizes $P(k)$ over every state. To do this, we add up all the log likelihoods per state for each value of sigma then choose the maximum. .

Done. . Sum for each value of sigma across provinces . Now that we have all the log likelihoods, we can sum for each value of sigma across provinces, graph it, then choose the maximum. . # Each index of this array holds the total of the log likelihoods for # the corresponding index of the sigmas array. total_log_likelihoods = np.zeros_like(sigmas) # Loop through each state&#39;s results and add the log likelihoods to the running total. for province_name, result in results.items(): total_log_likelihoods += result[&#39;log_likelihoods&#39;] # Select the index with the largest log likelihood total max_likelihood_index = total_log_likelihoods.argmax() # Select the value that has the highest log likelihood sigma = sigmas[max_likelihood_index] # Plot it fig, ax = plt.subplots() ax.set_title(f&quot;Maximum Likelihood value for $ sigma$ = {sigma:.2f}&quot;); ax.plot(sigmas, total_log_likelihoods) ax.axvline(sigma, color=&#39;k&#39;, linestyle=&quot;:&quot;) . &lt;matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x281370a8288&gt; .

            "content": ". Machine learning models can often be hard to understand and explain, in terms of how the model works to produce its predictions. Often we need to show how each of the features impact on the predictions. This is not just a theoretical problem - there may be laws in the future that will compel us to be able to explain how and why models arrived at their values. . A model fingerprint is an explanation of a model that describes what effect each of the model&#39;s features have on the target. This allows you to see inside the model at each feature, and get an explanation on that feature and how it impacts the model. The feature effects are broken down into three types . linear a change in the feature results in a constant change in the target | non-linear a change in the feature does not result in a constant change in the target | interaction These result from more than one features combining to produce an impact on the target, different from the effect that each feature has in isolation. | . Model Fingerprint . The implementation of model fingerprints is from the mlfinlab library. mlfinlab depends on scipy, numba and a few other scientific python libraries that are tricky to install locally, but is installable with no problem on Google Colab.

            "title": "Creating a Dataset for Classification",
            "content": ". Machine learning algorithms are fairly easy to use if you have data that matches exactly what the algorithms are designed for. To get going with an ML project with generic data, you could generate the data in the exact shape for your ML project. For example, if you want to do classification, then you will need a target columns with the predicted classes, and you will need a dataset with the features that could predict these classes. . If your machine learning project is in Python, then the best way to start is with scikit-learn. This easy to use yet powerful library also has convenience functions to generate test data, one of which is called make_classification. . make_classification . Scikit-learn has a utility function to generate test data for classification called make_classification. With it you can generate a numpy array with features along with another array with predicted classes. This function is in the datasets package so to use it you would do . from sklearn.datasets import make_classification . data, target = make_classification(...) . and you will get the data and the target with some relationship between the two sufficient to do some machine learning. Here is an example . First, set the random state . random_state=2 . from sklearn.datasets import make_classification data, target = make_classification(n_features=12, n_samples=100, random_state=random_state) . The data array is a numpy array of shape (n_samples, n_features) . data[:2], data.shape . (array([[ 0.65755125, -0.73564052, -0.25712497, 2.16246241, -0.46323032, 0.50442818, -0.1369783 , -2.42825346, -0.49282081, -0.64920516, 0.27511225, -0.45730883], [ 0.54894656, -0.07663956, -0.08224538, -0.15972413, 1.70937948, -1.82138864, -0.30466658, -2.02559359, 1.93662278, -1.31756727, -1.25432739, -1.71406741]]), (100, 12)) . The target is a numpy array of shape (n_samples). The values will be 0 or 1 because by default n_classes is 2 . target, target.shape . (array([0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]), (100,)) . Training a RandomForestClassifier . Now that we have the data, we can train a classifier and use it to predict a label. . from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier clf = RandomForestClassifier(max_depth=2, random_state=0) clf.fit(data, target) . RandomForestClassifier(bootstrap=True, ccp_alpha=0.0, class_weight=None, criterion=&#39;gini&#39;, max_depth=2, max_features=&#39;auto&#39;, max_leaf_nodes=None, max_samples=None, min_impurity_decrease=0.0, min_impurity_split=None, min_samples_leaf=1, min_samples_split=2, min_weight_fraction_leaf=0.0, n_estimators=100, n_jobs=None, oob_score=False, random_state=0, verbose=0, warm_start=False) . Predicting an output label . After training we predict by passing in a data array. For simplicity we just choose one of the data values and we get a predicted label. This is not groundbreaking machine learning, but it shows how to quickly get a dataset that you can use to try different machine learning algorithms. . clf.predict([data[90]]) . array([1]) . Create a classification dataframe . The downside of the make_classification function is that it create numpy arrays without meaningful feature names. The bigger problem is that the features have different aspects - some are informative, others are redundant, or simply plain noise, without any indicator of which is which. To improve on it you can create dataframes, which allow for meaningful names that help in analysis and explainability. . from sklearn.datasets import make_classification import pandas as pd from datetime import datetime def make_dataset(n_samples=1000, n_features=10, n_informative=6, n_redundant=2, n_classes=2, weights=None, random_state=2): data, target = make_classification(n_features=n_features, n_informative=n_informative, n_redundant=n_redundant, n_samples=n_samples, n_classes=n_classes, weights=weights, random_state=random_state, shuffle=False) index = pd.date_range(periods=n_samples, freq=pd.tseries.offsets.BDay(), end=datetime.today()).normalize() columns = [f&#39;Info{i}&#39; for i in range(n_informative)] + [f&#39;Redun{i}&#39; for i in range(n_redundant)] + [f&#39;Noise{i}&#39; for i in range(n_features - (n_informative + n_redundant))] df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=columns, index=index).round(3) target = pd.Series(target, index=index) return df, target data, target = make_dataset(1000, n_features=8, n_informative=4, n_classes=3, random_state=random_state) . The features . The generated dataframe contains 8 columns. . Informative features These are informative features, meaning features that have a predictive relationship with the target | Redundant features These features are generated as linear random combinations of the informative features | Noise These are just noise, and should have no predictive power | . data .

The target . The target variable contains the values 0,1,2 - three classes since we specified three classes in the make_dataset function call. These are roughly evenly distributed, though wecould have specified a different distribution of values. . pd.DataFrame(target, columns=[&#39;Target&#39;]).Target.value_counts().to_frame().sort_index() . Target . 0 334 | . 1 333 | . 2 333 | . Redundant Variables . If we plot the redundant variables we can see that it is a linear relationship to the informative variables. They can be safely dropped from the input features to a machine learning model, or otherwise handled in a special way. Of course, with real empirical data, you would not necessarily know that beforehand but would learn it during data exploration. . import altair as alt alt.Chart(data).mark_circle().encode( x=&#39;Info0&#39;, y=&#39;Redun1&#39; ).properties( title=&#39;Informative vs Redundant Variables&#39; ) . Informative Variables . The relationship between the informative variables and the target variables are a trickier to display on a chart because the target variable is categorical but if we plot we can see a relationship between these variables and the target. . To make it easier to see the relationship we bin the informative variables and set the size of the marker to the count in each bin. . df = data.copy() df[&#39;Target&#39;] = target . Plot Informative Variables vs Target . alt.Chart(df).mark_circle().encode( alt.X(&#39;Info0&#39;, bin=True), alt.Y(&#39;Target&#39;, bin=True), size=&#39;count()&#39; ).properties( title=&#39;Info1 vs Target&#39; ) . Noise . Noise seems, well random . alt.Chart(df).mark_circle().encode( alt.X(&#39;Noise0&#39;, bin=True), alt.Y(&#39;Target&#39;, bin=True), size=&#39;count()&#39; ).properties( title=&#39;Noise vs Target&#39; ) . Feature Importance . To see the importance of each feature, we train a RandomForestClassifier and then view or plot the feature importance. . clf = RandomForestClassifier(min_samples_split=4) clf.fit(data, target) feature_importance = pd.DataFrame({&#39;importance&#39;: clf.feature_importances_, &#39;feature&#39;: data.columns}).round(2) alt.Chart(feature_importance).mark_bar().encode( y=&#39;feature&#39;, x=&#39;importance:Q&#39; ).properties( title=&#39;Feature Importance&#39;, height=240 ) . As expected, the noise variables have the least importance. .",
