MSCs isolated from bone marrow (BM) and expanded in vitro in their undifferentiated phenotype, retain an extensive capacity for multi-lineage differentiation into chondrocytes, adipocytes, osteoblasts, and tenocytes under appropriate environmental cues (2). The presence of specific, distinct antigens identified by the monoclonal antibodies SH2, SH3, and SH4, on the surfaces of marrow-derived MSCs, that are not present on osteocytes and osteoblasts, suggests that these epitopes are developmentally regulated. The antigen which bound to SH2 antibody was identified as endoglin (CD105), a receptor for TGF-\u03b23, which potentially plays a role in mediating the chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs and in their interactions with hematopoietic cells (3).",

In this study, we employed ABI GeneChips (representing > 30,000 genes) to identify genes differentially expressed during BM-MSC chondrogenesis. ABI is introduced technology based on nylon-spotted 60 mer oligonucleotides, that uses on oligomers to detect each gene for most genes, chemiluminescence to measure gene expression levels, and fluorescence to grid to normalize and identify microarray features. The ABI gene list was compiled from information in public and Celera databases (6). This study was designed to identify differential gene expression profiles and novel genes that might be involved in BM-MSC chondrogenesis.",

HSF-2 plays an important role in FGF-2 stimulated osteoclast formation, and HSF-2 deficiency was found to modulate gene expression in stromal/preosteoblast cells and affect osteoclastogenesis in the bone microenvironment (18). Annexins bind to negatively charged phospholipids in a Ca2+-dependent manner and have a conserved structure. The human annexin, annexin A2 (alternative names: annexin II, p36, and lipocortin II) is expressed abundantly in various human organs, including the placenta, lungs, heart, and liver (19). At the cellular level, annexin A2 is expressed on endothelial cell surfaces and acts as a co-receptor for plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator (20). Furthermore, annexins are commonly dysregulated in cancer (21) and annexin A2 is upregulated in a variety of tumors and cancer cell lines (22, 23). Contactin-1 is a cell surface adhesion molecule, which is normally expressed by neurons, oligodendrocytes, and human astrocytic gliomas (24, 25). Previous studies have reported that MSCs express IL-15, essential hematopoietic growth factor (26, 27) and IL-15 is also a potent apoptosis inhibitor and has many immunomodulatory activities (28). The Serotonin receptor 7 is the most recently identified member of the serotonin receptor family and is found in brain, mainly in the hypothalamus, thalamus, hippocampus, and cortex (29).",
