Finally, expression of folate receptor \u03b1 (which does not augment GP-driven entry [29, 31]), TIM-3, and CLEC5A (a lectin that interacts with dengue virus [32]), did not modulate transduction under all conditions tested.

The EBOV-GP1 subunit was also able to bind to DC-SIGN, in keeping with published results [10, 11, 33], but binding to the other proteins tested was within the background range, at least under the conditions used (Figure 2B). Thus, augmentation of GP-driven host cell entry by lectins but not by TIM-1 and Axl might rely on efficient binding to the GP1 subunit, in keeping with the concept that the latter factors augment EBOV-GP\u2013driven entry by binding to PtdSer in the viral envelope [20, 23].\n",

However, a comparison between endogenous TIM-1 and Axl expression on cell lines and susceptibility to EBOV-GP and EBOV-GP\u0394muc-driven transduction revealed no correlation (Figure 3B).

In keeping with this finding, siRNA-mediated knock-down of Axl and TIM-1 expression had no appreciable effect on EBOV-GP\u2013driven transduction of MDMs (Figure 5B). In contrast, knock-down of NPC1 significantly reduced MDM transduction mediated by EBOV-GP but not VSV-G. Similarly, transduction of MDMs by EBOV-GP\u2013 but not VSV-G\u2013bearing pseudotypes was reduced efficiently and in a concentration-dependent manner by U18666A (Figure 5C), indicating that NPC1 might be required for EBOV infection of macrophages. Finally, the mannose-polymer mannan, which inhibits ligand binding to DC-SIGN and related lectins, did not inhibit GP-driven transduction of MDMs, although it markedly reduced transduction of 293T cells expressing DC-SIGN (Figure 5D), indicating that mannose-specific lectins do not promote GP-dependent entry into macrophages.\n",

Therefore, we asked whether EBOV-GP might exploit other cellular factors with a comparable activity for macrophage entry. We focused our analysis on integrin \u03b1V, CD14, CD36, LOX-1, SR-A, and Mer, all known to be expressed in macrophages and to play a role in the detection of apoptotic cells [38]. Moreover, integrin \u03b1V and Mer were previously implicated in EBOV-GP\u2013mediated entry [13, 14]. Transfection of siRNAs directed against integrin \u03b1V, SR-A, and Mer expression significantly reduced EBOV-GP\u2013 but not VSV-G\u2013mediated transduction of MDMs (Figure 6A, left). Moreover, a combination of siRNAs against Mer, SR-A and NPC1 reduced transduction more efficiently than the single siRNAs (Figure 6A, right), suggesting that Mer, SR-A, NPC1, and integrin \u03b1V might all be required for robust EBOV-GP\u2013mediated transduction of macrophages.\n",

We analyzed the effects of siRNA transfection on Mer expression using THP-1 cell\u2013derived macrophages, because Mer protein was readily detected on these cells but not on MDMs, owing to high background signals measured for the latter. Mer expression was modestly reduced upon transfection of Mer-specific but not NPC1- or SR-A\u2013specific siRNA (Figure 6B). Similarly, expression of SR-A in MDMs was reduced by siRNA specific for SR-A but not NPC1. Transfection of siRNA directed against Mer had a slight but reproducible effect on SR-A expression (Figure 6B), suggesting that full expression of SR-A might depend on parallel expression of Mer, a scenario in keeping with published findings [39].",

In contrast, siRNA against Mer had no significant effect on EBOV-GP\u2013mediated transduction and slightly augmented transduction driven by VSV-G. Finally, siRNA directed against SR-A reduced EBOV-GP\u2013 but not VSV-G\u2013driven transduction by 45% (Figure 6C), suggesting off-target effects. To further investigate the role of SR-A, we asked whether tannic acid, which blocks ligand binding to SR-A [42], inhibits transduction of MDMs. Indeed, tannic acid reduced EBOV-GP\u2013 but not VSV-G\u2013mediated transduction in a robust and concentration dependent manner (Figure 6D).

Augmentation of GP-driven entry upon TIM-1, Axl, and TIM-4 expression was either more pronounced or exclusively observed for EBOV-GP\u0394muc compared to EBOV-GP WT, suggesting that the presence of the mucinlike domain might modulate augmentation of GP-driven transduction by PtdSer-binding proteins. The inability of TIM-3 to augment entry is due to inadequate presentation of its PtdSer-binding domain [45].

            "text": "SR-A is expressed in macrophages and dendritic cells and contributes to the macrophage uptake of a broad spectrum of ligands, including apoptotic cells [49]. EBOV-GP1 did not bind to cells expressing SR-A and directed expression of SR-A did not augment GP-driven transduction (not shown) but treatment of MDMs with SR-A\u2013specific siRNA consistently reduced EBOV-GP\u2013 but not VSV-G\u2013driven entry as well as EBOV infection. Furthermore, GP-driven transduction of MDMs was also inhibited by tannic acid and fucoidan (not shown), SR-A ligands [42, 50], arguing for a role of SR-A in entry of EBOVs into macrophages. On the other hand, siRNA against SR-A also reduced GP-driven entry into SR-A\u2013negative HeLa cells, and alveolar macrophages isolated from SR-A knockout and WT mice were equally susceptible to GP-driven transduction (not shown). Further studies are therefore required to fully define the potential role of SR-A in macrophage entry of ebolaviruses. Collectively, our results support the concept that ebolaviruses use apoptotic mimicry for infection of cell lines and macrophages and suggest that the set of factors exploited by the viruses for this purpose may be cell type dependent.",
