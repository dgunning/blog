            "text": "In this study, we describe a pseudotyping approach to load exosomal membranes with reporter and targeting proteins. Pseudotyping is often used in the production of recombinant viruses and involves packaging the genetic components of the virus (DNA or RNA) with envelope proteins derived from a different virus.28\u201330 This method allows one to select viral envelope proteins to alter host tropism, which may result in enhanced infection of the recombinant virus.31,32 The G glycoprotein of the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) is frequently used for viral pseudotyping, owing to its broad tropism and high efficacy in transduction, and in fact most of the retroviruses approved for clinical trials are pseudotyped with VSVG.33\u201335 Mechanistically, VSVG is incorporated into the viral envelope during the budding of microdomains at the plasma membrane, the same domains involved in the formation of endosomes and exosomes.36 This connection led us to propose the possibility of engineering exosomes with specific membrane-bound proteins by expressing gene-encoding VSVG fusion proteins in their mother cells. Taking advantage of the modular structure and well-defined membrane topology of VSVG, we engineered VSVG to achieve the following two biological objectives: 1) effective protein loading via terminal tagging of VSVG and 2) enhanced exosome uptake via VSVG pseudotyping. By generating exosomes that harbor a VSVG fusion with a protein that recognizes a surface biomarker on a target cell, it should be possible to generate exosomes repurposed as vehicles for intracellular delivery of functional fluorescent proteins and antibodies to diseased cells for high-contrast imaging and therapy, respectively.",

By domain swapping, we subsequently identified a minimal molecular scaffold of VSVG (mVSVG) that contained sufficient signals for exosome targeting and protein loading. We further demonstrated robust internalization of pseudotyped exosomes by a variety of cell types, including four somatic and two induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell lines.

Key to the success of our pseudotyping approach was to control the topology of VSVG on the exosome membrane. We hypothesized that the preferred topology of VSVG on the exosome would be one where the VSVG protein is retained in the membrane by the interaction of its hydrophobic tail with the bilayer membrane. This anchoring strategy would position the ectodomain of fVSVG to the outer surface of the exosome for pseudotyping (Figure 1A and D). Moreover, by fusing targeting molecules to fVSVG, one could maximize interactions of the exosome with surface antigens on the plasma membrane of a target cell. Alternatively, by swapping the ectodomain with a cell-trophic peptide or a disease-targeting antibody, one could target the exosome to a specific tissue or tumor.39 This latter approach could be further refined for in vivo targeted therapy and imaging of tumors or diseased tissue by fusing an engineered antibody or a near-infrared fluorescent protein.",

To ensure these fusion proteins were properly anchored with the correct topography on exosomal membranes, the SP sequences and the transmembrane helix of fVSVG were left intact in all fusion proteins (Figure 1B). This strategy would limit the synthesis of VSVG to the surface of the rough ER, with the SP sequence guiding the insertion of the ectodomain into the ER lumen (Figure 1C). In a later section of the manuscript, we show this strategy correctly positions the transmembrane helix of VSVG fusion proteins in the membrane of HEK293 cells, with the C-terminal tail projecting into the cytoplasm. Previous studies have shown that the SP sequence is removed and the remaining VSVG molecules concentrate in tetraspanin-enriched microdomains of the plasma membrane.40,41 Exosomes are believed to form these domains in two sequential inward-budding processes: the first generates an endosome, while the second leads to the formation of multiple-vesicle bodies that eventually release individual exosomes into the extracellular space (Figure 1C).7",

These studies showed the fVSVG fusion protein localizes to punctate structures in all three cell types and strongly suggests that fVSVG plays a common role in exosome biogenesis in a variety of human cell types (Figure S2A). Moreover, we found that the intracellular pattern of RFP-mVSVG was similar to fVSVG in the additional cell lines (Figure S2B).

If the pseudotyped exosomes are released from transfected cells, high levels of luciferase activities could be expected from the conditioned medium. As predicted, we detected high levels of luciferase in conditioned medium: 1,734-fold and 250-fold higher for Gluc-mVSVG and fVSVG-Gluc, respectively, compared to those of the untransfected controls (Figure 5B). The difference in the activity of the transfected luciferase fusion proteins for these two reporters could arise from the limited availability of the coelenterazine substrate, since the Gluc-mVSVG is on the outer surface of the exosome, and hence it is more accessible to the substrate. Nevertheless, these results suggest fVSVG/mVSVG carry their appended luciferase onto exosomes in an active form, and in both cases the exosomes are released into the extracellular space.",

The delivery of the two classes of engineered exosomes to target cells was determined by imaging the distribution of intracellular red fluorescence in HEK293, HEPG2, U87, and L929 cells after incubation with the RFP-labeled exosomes (5 \u00b5g/well). Cells incubated with purified exosomes for 48 hours were imaged using fluorescence microscopy. Approximately 95% of HEPG2, U87, and HEK293 cells showed strong perinuclear fluorescence due to the uptake of RFP-fVSVG-loaded exosomes (Figure 6A, C, E, and G). On the other hand, only weak red fluorescence was recorded after incubating the same cell types with mVSVG-modified exosomes (Figure 6B, D, F, and H). These results led to two important conclusions: first, exosome delivery to recipient cells is enhanced by fVSVG pseudotyping, and second the ectodomain of fVSVG plays an important role in the binding and subsequent uptake of exosomes by recipient cells.",

Maguire et al45 used VSVG to pseudotype extracellular vesicles and found that adeno-associated virus coupled with these pseudotyped vesicles gained enhanced ability of gene delivery, implicating extracellular vesicles with viral infection. In later studies, Marsac et al46 and Kuate et al47 used VSVG to boost antibody production against viral peptides, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CV) S protein and an HIV-Gag epitope. In both cases, both VSVG and a viral protein (SARS-CV-S protein or HIV-Gag) were included as components of the exosome-based vaccination material. Notably, Mangeot et al6 were able to use VSVG alone to produce VSVG-induced nanovesicles, termed \u201cgesicles\u201d, for protein transfer into human cells, avoiding viral delivery totally. Although those studies pointed to the possibility of a convergent mechanism via vesicle pseudo-typing, the exact molecular mechanisms and final destination of VSVG in living mammalian cells remain elusive. Importantly, whether the VSVG molecule has an intrinsic ability to target exosomes and thus can be particularly used for exosome engineering remains to be tested.",

This strategy can be further developed to deliver exosomes to defined cell types simply by appending VSVG with an enzyme that could form the basis of a replacement therapy for a hereditary disease, or cell-recognizing peptides for targeting, or engineered therapeutic antibodies that target specific suppressors of cytotoxic T cells for cancer therapy.53 Third, we have demonstrated that exosomes pseudotyped with VSVG are internalized by a diverse collection of human and murine cells, including two human iPS cell lines. This targeting and the subsequent internalization of exosomes by recipient cells require the ectodomain. Fourth, the role of the VSVG ectodomain for protein loading and delivery is multifaceted. The native VSVG ectodomain is dispensable for protein loading, and thus deletion of the ectodomain can make room for other polypeptide loading. For example, RFP can replace the ectodomain, and chimeric protein can be loaded onto exo-somes. Because the ectodomain serves as an important docking molecule for exosome loading, it can be potentially replaced with other cell-tropic peptides; therefore, this strategy can be used for engineering targeted exosomes for delivery.",

            "text": "Figure 1: Strategy of exosome pseudotyping. Notes: (A) Membrane topology of the fVSVG. The matured fVSVG is a single transmembrane protein without the SP. The large N-terminal ectodomain (black line) with a short stem region (green line) is situated at the outer surface of the plasma membrane or the luminal side of the endosome. Those sequences are followed by a transmembrane helix and a cytoplasmic tail. (B) Design of VSVG fusion constructs. From top to bottom, the fVSVG fused with either RFP (fVSVG-RFP) or GFP (fVSVG-GFP) at the C-terminal, the ectodomain was replaced by RFP (RFP-mVSVG), the fVSVG fused with Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) at the C-terminal (fVSVG-Gluc), and the ectodomain was replaced by Gluc (Gluc-mVSVG). (C) A proposed model illustrating how VSVG participates in exosomes in a mammalian cell. Ectopic expression of VSVG occurs at the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via its SP guiding, and subsequently SP-cleaved VSVG is funneled to the plasma membrane and becomes concentrated in tetraspanin (CD63)-enriched microdomains, where the first inward budding begins to form endosomes. The second inward budding from the endosome forms exosomes that are stored in a MVB prior to release into extracellular space. (D) Schematic illustration of the pseudotyped and protein-loaded exosome. Membrane topology of VSVG (black), loaded protein cargo GFP (green) or RFP (red), and exosome markers (CD63/CD81, blue) are indicated.

Cell images of fluorescence signal and phase contract of the same field were taken to show the expression and an earlier plasma membrane distribution of fVSVG-GFP on day 2 (A, green; B, overlay), and late-punctate intracellular localization on day 3 (C, green; D, overlay). Similarly, the expression and subcellular localization of fVSVG are shown in red (E\u2013H). Interestingly, following cotransfection of cells with fVSVG-RFP and Rab5A-GFP (an endosome marker) for 3 days, images show the expression and cellular distribution of fVSVG (I, red), Rab5A (J, green), or colocalization of both (K, yellow). Alternatively, cotransfection with both fVSVG-RFP and CD63-GFP (an exosome marker) resulted in similar patterns of expression and cellular distribution for fVSVG (L, red), CD63 (M, green), and colocalization of both (N, yellow).
