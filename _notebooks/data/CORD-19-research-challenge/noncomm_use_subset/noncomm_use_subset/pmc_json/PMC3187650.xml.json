However, the ANOVA approach relies upon accurate estimates of sample variance, and proteomics studies not only have inherent variability associated with the biological samples, but potentially diverse process-based sources of variability. That is, the accurate estimate of sample variances is often difficult to obtain. For example, sample preparation protocols and instrument variations associated with the LC column (particularly important for multi-column platforms) and mass spectrometer can cause variations in peak intensities, as well as peptides identified across MS analyses within an experiment. Data quality is especially important when the number of biological samples is small, often the case in proteomics experiments, and extreme values can negatively influence all subsequent data analysis outcomes.",

            "text": "Identification of statistical outliers in univariate data is an established but highly debated statistical topic (Barnett and Lewis, 1994; Hawkins, 1980). There are many consecutive outlier procedures, focusing on one suspect value at a time, that have been proposed and implemented across many fields of application, such as Grubbs' test and Dixon's Q-test (Dixon, 1950; Grubbs, 1950). Because these methods iteratively remove outlier points, the false positive rate (i.e. Type 1 error) is inflated (Jain, 2010). In contrast, recursive outlier detection procedures detect the presence of any number of outliers and control Type 1 errors. For example, Jain (2010) presents a recursive version of Grubbs' test and Caroni and Prescott (1992) derived a sequential application of Wilks's multivariate outlier test. There are downfalls to these recursive procedures: (i) they are designed for univariate data, and if applied to multivariate data, will likely fail to detect statistically influential extreme values, and (ii) they are negatively affected by masking (i.e. the inability to detect an outlier in the presence of another outlier) and swamping (i.e. identify non-outliers as outliers) effects.",

The multiple dimensions of the data often subject outliers to masking (Filzmoser et al., 2008). The microarray community, however, has made considerable progress in applying statistical metrics to assess the quality of microarray data (Kauffmann et al., 2009; Kemmeren et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2006; Wilson and Miller, 2005). Of particular applicability to proteomics data are the ideas presented by Kauffmann et al. They note that a poor quality array will impede the statistical and biological significance of the analysis due to the added noise. This is also true for proteomics data. That is, poor quality peptide abundance data will hinder downstream statistical analysis, including normalization, and subsequent biological interpretations.",

The sample correlation coefficient is calculated among technical replicates and biological replicates. Those runs with a relatively low correlation are removed from the dataset. The determination of \u2018low\u2019 correlation is subjective, and varies across analysts, experiments and time. Correlation may be examined via a heat map in which a color palette represents the numeric value, the color palette choice as well as the range of correlation values it covers can be highly subjective and extremely influential on the selection of which runs should be removed from the dataset. In addition, the sample correlation coefficient can only be computed across peptides with common identifications between runs (i.e. it does not account for missing data), it does not account for the multivariate nature of LC-MS runs, nor is there any statistical certainty associated with the exclusion of a run.",

            "text": "Advanced statistical approaches to outlier detection in proteomics data have focused either on the identification of outlier spectra maps (Rudnick et al., 2010; Schulz-Trieglaff et al., 2009) or on peptide/protein abundances independent of LC-MS run behavior (Cho et al., 2008; MacCoss et al., 2003; Xia et al., 2006). Rudnick et al. (2010) described a large set of metrics for the quantitative assessment of system performance and evaluation of technical variability among inter- and intra-laboratory LC-MS/MS proteomics experiments. However, the use of these metrics to assess the quality of an individual LC-MS/MS run is not addressed. Schulz-Trieglaff et al. (2009) applied a multivariate method to perform a quality assessment of raw LC-MS maps using 20 quality descriptors. The goal of their approach was to identify and remove outlier runs using unprocessed spectra before noise filtering, peak detection or centroiding was performed. Cho et al. (2008) presented a peptide outlier detection method using quantile regression to account for the heterogeneity of variance between replicate LC-MS/MS runs. Peptide intensity ratios were plotted on an MA plot, where M is the difference in peptide abundance values and A is the average peptide intensity value. MacCoss et al. (2003) developed a correlation algorithm to detect outlier peptides using fractional changes between sample and reference intensities. Xia et al. (2006) proposed a two-stage method, combining Dixon's Q-test and a median absolute deviation (MAD) modified z-score test, for outlier detection of peptide ratios. These latter methods focus on assessing individual peptides for extreme behavior rather than the distribution of peptide abundance values for an entire LC-MS run.",

Consequently, we are not focused on outliers specific to the spectral properties. We describe a statistical strategy to identify and remove extreme LC-MS runs with a high level of statistical certainty, thus removing subjectivity from the filtering process. The approach, based on a robust Mahalanobis distance (rMd), assesses the reproducibility of the distribution of peptide abundance values across replicate runs of the same biological sample as well across related biological samples. Statistical methods, which limit the influence of extreme observations, are applied to obviate assumptions about underlying probabilistic models (Hoaglin et al., 2000). We demonstrate the approach by applying it to simulated and real LC-MS datasets.",

Nanoelectrospray ionization was used in the analysis of all samples. Spectra were collected at 400\u20132000 m/z with a resolution of 100 k and analyzed using the accurate mass and elution time (AMT) tag approach (Smith et al., 2002). The mass de-isotoping process was performed using Decon2LS (Jaitly et al., 2009), and the matching process was performed using VIPER (Monroe et al., 2007). Features from the LC-MS analyses were matched to AMT tags to identify peptides, using an initial tolerance of \u00b13 p.p.m. for mass and 2.5% for the LC normalized elution time (NET). The human cell culture peptide datasets were further processed to remove peptides identified with low confidence, using the uniqueness filter Statistical Likelihood Confidence (SLiC) (Anderson et al., 2006) score of 0.35 and a DelSLiC of 0.2. In circumstances where a peptide was identified in some LC-MS analyses, but not others, the missing data were coded as \u2018NaN\u2019. All peptide abundance values were transformed to the log10 scale. Minimum occurrence data filters were used to identify those peptides for which the amount of data present was not adequate for differential abundance analysis (Webb-Robertson et al., 2010). The sample complexity of the sham controls (SCs) in each of the designed experiments is the same with respect to original biological material.",

Of the six runs identified as statistical outliers, it is unlikely any would have been removed using run-by-run correlation coefficient, rij, as the median correlation of all runs is 0.86 (Fig. 3c), and ranging from 0.72 to 0.87 across the pool of identified outlier runs. Using a more reflective score of correlation, Ri, which for the i-th run is the average correlation among the biological replicates within a group, the rMd-PAV identified runs would not have been removed from the dataset as the median correlation is 0.88 ranging from 0.73 to 0.85 across the identified outlier runs.",

Explaining high-dimensional data in two or three latent variables (i.e. principal components) is highly desirable. With only a few latent variables, data can be graphically displayed and the key contributing attributes to the total explained variation is easily interpreted. The relationship among the five metrics for peptide abundance data can be understood by examining the score plots of the latent variables. In addition, the behavior of the outlier runs can be understood relative to the non-outlier runs (i.e. average).",

The score plot is unique to an experiment, and thus is an excellent tool to further understand statistical differences in the peptides distributions among the LC-MS runs. The first score plot to consider is a comparison of the first two rPCA components (i.e. latent variables). In combination they account for >88% of the total variation in the data, and suggest differences among kurtosis, skew and fraction of missing abundance data explain most of the variation in the data. The plot shows the rMd-PAV identified runs located at the extreme ends of the observed data with respect to the first and second latent variables. Using the angle between vectors as a visual guide, for this data, it can be deduced the Fraction Missing Data and Skew of the peptide abundance distribution are correlated. In total, the first three components account for ~95% of the variation observed in the data. While a two-dimensional view of the data is helpful in understanding relationships among variables, outliers and non-outliers, it is the relationship among the data under the full dimensionality that is the basis for the evidence of outlier runs.\n",

Caution should always be taken when removing data from any dataset, large or small, and data should not be removed solely on the grounds of a statistical outlier test. Rather, the results of any statistical outlier algorithm used should always be reviewed in the context of the research goal and the experiment. Often the extreme data values are of interest and may explain technical difficulties in the process (e.g. sample preparation issues, technical difficulties with instrumentation and a mislabeling of samples). However, as with any statistical analysis and especially those dealing with small sample sizes, reviewing the outcome of the analysis is imperative. Specifically, graphical methods allow the analyst to review the analysis in a stepwise manner. For example, as our first step, we first plot the peptide abundances observed in the experiment for each LC-MS run using a box plot. Then to understand how the abundance distributions vary across the LC-MS runs we examine the scores plot resulting from the robust PCA.",

The value of the multivariate outlier discovery strategy utilizing rMd-PAV scores is the use of an objective probabilistic model to assess statistical certainty of the exclusion of runs within an experiment in the context of the complete dataset. Proteomics has placed considerable effort on assuring the quality of the peptide identification with respect to spectral processing (Piening et al., 2006; Rudnick et al., 2010; Schulz-Trieglaff et al., 2009; Stead et al., 2008); however, quality assessment of the subsequent data matrix has focused on subjective visual inspection of run-by-run correlation, or individual peptide components. The quality of the LC-MS peptide abundance data matrix is essential to the identification of robust biomarkers. Moreover, statistical evaluation of the data relies upon tools often based on linear models, such as ANOVA which require accurate estimates of variance (Bukhman et al., 2008; Daly et al., 2008; Karpievitch et al., 2009; Oberg et al., 2008). Without proper identification of statistical outlier runs the estimates of variance will be inflated, which may have a considerable effect on the identification of significant peptides and proteins.",
