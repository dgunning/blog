The sample cDNAs were tested in a 3-tube reaction following the protocol supplied by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Maryland, USA). Tube-1 contained primers set A targeting AdV, hCoV 229E/NL63, and PIV1-3. Tube-2 contained primers set B targeting hCoV OC43/HKU1, hRV A/B/C, RSV A/B, and IAV. Tube-3 contained primers set C targeting hBoV 1/2/3/4, IBV, hMPV, PIV4, and hEV. Positive controls included a mixture of all 15 virus clones. The negative control contained only double distilled water. The PCR amplification was performed using 10 \u00b5l of Seeplex RV master mix (Seegene, Seoul, Korea), 4 \u00b5l of 5X multiplex primer sets, 3 \u00b5l of 8-MOP solution, and 3 \u00b5l of newly synthesized first-strand cDNA (1 \u00b5g/3 \u00b5l). The Seeplex RV contained A, B, and C sets of primers designed from highly conserved regions of genetic sequences for the 15 respiratory viruses. An initial pre-PCR step of 94\u00b0C for 15 minutes was performed in a thermocycler 9600 (Perkin-Elmer, Ohio, USA), followed by a total of 35 PCR cycles under the following conditions: 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, 60\u00b0C for 1.5 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1.5 min. The final cycle was followed by an extension step at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. The amplified PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. The type of respiratory virus was identified by comparison with the reference band size provided by the manufacturer.",

Previous studies using RT PCR techniques reported viral co-infection rates of 5-10%, with RSV, hRV, PIVs, and hMPV being the most commonly implicated viruses in cases of mixed infections.12,19-21 In this study, the high detection rate of RSV with hMPV (4/9; 44.4%) and hRV with hCoV (2/9, 22.2%) in viral co-infections was an interesting finding.

Our results confirm that RSV and hRV play a key role in RTI's in children; RSV was the most frequent respiratory virus detected, followed by hRV. The predominance of RSV in this study is in accordance with the assertion that this virus is the single most frequent lower respiratory tract pathogen in infants and young children in Saudi Arabia and worldwide.4,5,15,20 It would be important for local pediatricians to use antibiotics cautiously when children are hospitalized with ARTI's. The hRV has been known to be responsible for URTI's and some LRTI's in children.19,24 Our findings showed that the presence of hRV in all age groups. Most hRVs (17/22; 77.3%) were associated with URTI's and 22.7% of hRV were detected in bronchiolitis (4 cases), or pneumonia (one case).",

The hMPV is one of the causes of upper and lower RTI's, especially in preschool and older children. In our study, hMPV was the fourth most frequent viral pathogen accounting for 11.9% of all cases. In a previous Saudi study,14 hMPV was identified in 8.3% of 489 children with ARTI's. In contrast to some studies,12,26,28 all hMPV-positive cases in this study were below 2 years of age and almost half of the cases (7/13; 54%) were co-infected with other viruses. The detection rates for IVs and PIVs in our study were comparable with other studies, reporting rates of 0.8-12.6% for IV's and 2.8-19.4% for PIV's.3,5,13,19,20,23,26",
