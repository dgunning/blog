The vv recombinant expressing the MHV-M protein, as well as the COOH and NH2 terminus-specific antibodies to the M protein were described before (51). The following antibodies were used throughout this study; a peptide antibody to p16 (A14L; 51), to p11(F17R; 26), antibodies to p25 (L4R), and 4a (A10L) were a kind gift of Dr. Hruby (Oregon State University, Corvalis, OR; 57, 58); the antibodies to p39 (A4L) were a gift of Dr. Esteban (National Centre of Biotechnology, Madrid, Spain; 39); and the antibodies to p32 (D8L) were a gift of Dr. Niles (SUNY Medical School, Buffalo, NY; 43). To make antibodies to p21 (A17L) and p35 (H3L) peptides matching amino acid 17 through 37 of p21 and amino acid 31 through 43 of the H3L sequence were synthesized. Antibodies were made according to Cudmore et al. (8). One OD260 unit of purified WR was treated with NP-40 and DTT to make viral cores as described by Cudmore et al. (8). The cores were fixed for 30 min at room temperature with 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 9, and an antibody, further referred to as anti-core antibody was generated as described by Cudmore et al. (8).",

Throughout this study we therefore used the alkylating reagent NEM before cell lysis. Disulfide bonding was analyzed under three different conditions of infection. First, IMV was isolated and purified using our standard protocols, except that the infected cells were treated with NEM (or iodoacetamide; data not shown) before lysis, in order to assess the disulfide bonding as it occurred in the (isolated) IMV. Second, cells were infected in the presence of rifampicin, a drug that reversibly blocks the IMV formation at an early assembly stage but does not interfere with the synthesis of late proteins (40); this allowed us to assess whether or not the disulfide bonding depended on IMV assembly. Finally, cell lysates were also prepared from infected cells that were not treated with rifampicin to study the vv proteins in the infected cells at all stages of assembly.",

The amount of dimer formation was somewhat variable; in the case of p21 and p16 \u223c50% of the protein dimerized (see also below) while of p32 no more than 30% of the protein was in the dimer form. As noted before (48, 49, 55), the dimers of both p16 and p21 migrated at molecular masses that were smaller than the sum of two monomers. We presume that this is a consequence of a folded conformation of the dimer and not due to heterodimerization. By two-dimensional (2-D) gel analysis we have shown before that the dimers of p21 and p16 run at the same pI as their respective monomers (26). Since heterodimer formation would result in a shift of the pI relative to the monomeric protein, these 2-D gel data show that both proteins form homodimers. ",

Indeed, in rifampicin treated cell lysates both proteins migrated at the position of their precursor form and the migration of both proteins was the same when analyzed with or without prior reduction. However, in the IMV the mature forms of these two proteins showed additional bands when analyzed without reduction. The protein 4a occurred both as a monomer of 65 kD, as well as a dimer of \u223c130 kD when \u03b2-ME and DTT were omitted from the sample buffer (Fig. 2 b). That the dimer indeed ran at \u223c130 kD can be better appreciated in Fig. 8, where 4a was analyzed in a 10% SDS-PAGE (see below). After reduction 4a migrated predominantly in its (reduced) mature form of 65 kD, while the 130 kD band was clearly absent. Two additional bands were seen in this reduced sample, the upper one represents the uncleaved precursor, p4a (note the comigration of this band with the form made in rifampicin-blocked cell lysates), of which small amounts can be detected in mature virions, while the identity of the lower of the two remained open. When analyzing p25 in isolated virions under nonreducing conditions the protein showed a very unusual pattern and appeared as several (disulfide bonded) species some of which migrated as a smear rather than discrete bands (Fig. 2 b). When analyzed after reduction, the protein migrated predominantly at the position expected for its mature 25-kD form, but also, as for 4a, some of the uncleaved precursor could still be detected. ",

Therefore, we performed two experiments to address this issue. First, isolated and purified IMVs were labeled with [3H]NEM for 20 min on ice and the labeled protein pattern compared with [35S]methionine-labeled virions. [3H]NEM labeling showed a discrete pattern of bands, the most abundant of which comigrated with the core proteins 4a, p11, and p25 (Fig. 3 a). Some of the other minor bands were identified as p21, p16, and p35 (not shown).

As shown in Fig. 3 b, IMVs isolated from untreated cells were readily labeled with [3H]NEM and showed the same characteristic labeling pattern as in Fig. 3 a. In contrast, when infected cells were incubated with NEM before virus isolation, the virion were not labeled at all by [3H]NEM. The corresponding silver stained gel of the same virion preparations showed that the absence of labeling was not due to a lack of (viral) proteins (Fig. 3 c). We interpret these results to mean that upon preteatment of infected cells with (cold) NEM, this component readily binds to viral proteins, efficiently inhibiting the subsequent [3H]NEM labeling.",

That p16 may adopt two different topologies in infected cells was based on two independent pieces of evidence. First, using two different morphological assays we were able to show that a considerable fraction of p16 exposes the COOH terminus towards the cytosol (51). Second, since p16 is also partially N-glycosylated, its COOH terminus (that contains the N-glycosylation site) must also be exposed towards the lumen. A recently developed assay to quantitate the two different topologies of p16 in infected cells (Krijnse Locker and Griffiths, manuscript in preparation), showed that \u223c50% of the disulfide bonded dimer of p16 exposes its COOH terminus towards the cytoplasm, implying that disulfide bonding of this protein occurs, at least in part, on its cytoplasmic domain.",

Thus, the protein seems to belong to a recently described class of membrane proteins with COOH-terminal hydrophobic domains that insert posttranslationally, thereby exposing most of their NH2 terminus towards the cytoplasm (35). If p32 inserts into the membrane accordingly, the protein would expose its single cysteine in the NH2 terminus at position 262 towards the cytoplasm as well as on the outer surface of the IMV (see also 54). To test this possibility, we carried out two different set of experiments. First, purified IMV was treated with increasing concentrations of trypsin and the digestion of p32 was assayed by Western blot using an antibody recognizing amino acid 77 to 294 (43). Under conditions in which the internally located core protein 4a was completely protease-protected, the entire population of both the dimer as well as the monomer of p32 were digested (Fig. 5 a). In fact, after pelleting the IMV from the digestion mixture, a new 28-kD fragment that was recognized by the p32 antibody was now detected in the supernatant, while the digested virion was totally devoid of immunoreactive p32 protein (Fig. 5 a). The well characterized peripheral membrane protein p14 was completely digested even at the lowest protease concentration tested and no protected fragment was detected in the supernatant. ",

The topology of this latter membrane protein has been well established, exposing its extreme COOH terminus of \u223c18 amino acids towards the cytoplasm and its NH2 terminus lumenally (32). Indeed, with increasing concentrations of trypsin, reactivity to a peptide antibody raised against the COOH-terminal 18 amino acids of the MHV-M protein was completely lost (Fig. 5 b). In contrast, at all trypsin concentrations tested, the antibody to the NH2 terminus recognized the characteristic triplet representing the unglycosylated and two of the O-glycosylated forms of M (see also 33), showing that the membranes were intact (Fig. 5 b). When analyzing p32 under the same conditions, both the dimer as well as the monomer were completely digested.

Estimation of the cleavage of the precursor of a protein such as the core protein 4a using pulse\u2013 chase experiments can thus be used as an indirect measure of the extent of IMV formation. To test the effect of DTT on IMV assembly using this assay, infected cells were left untreated or treated with DTT from 4 h after infection onwards. Subsequently, they were pulse labeled for 15 min at 6 h after infection, chased for 2 or 3 h and cell lysates were then processed for immunoprecipitation, using antibodies to 4a and its precursor. Again, during the course of this experiment the medium was replaced several times with medium containing freshly prepared DTT (see legend to Fig. 7). As shown in Fig. 7 both in the presence and absence of DTT the precursor p4a of 110 kD was efficiently cleaved into its 65-kD mature form (4a) during the chase. PhosphorImager analyses showed that, consistent with previously published results (41; Fig. 7), after 2 h of chase 35% of 4a was cleaved in the absence and 40% in the presence of DTT, while these percentages amounted to 48 and 57%, respectively, after 3 h of chase (not shown). These same analyses also showed that the overall synthesis of 4a was reduced by \u223c40% in the presence of DTT, which is most likely the result of the long incubations with this drug. Importantly, however, 4a and p4a did not seem to undergo substantial degradation, suggesting that the newly formed cores were quite stable, both with and without DTT. ",

A possibility that remained to be ruled out was that the disulfide bonds of vv proteins might resist the DTT treatment. We decided therefore to isolate the virions from infected cells and to analyze the disulfide bonding of their proteins. For this, infected cells were left untreated or were treated with DTT from 4 until 9 h after infection and IMVs were isolated after extensive washing of the cells with PBS containing NEM to quench the DTT. Again during the 5-h DTT treatment the medium with DTT was replaced every hour with medium containing fresh DTT. After virus isolation the disulfide bonding of selected membrane and core proteins was analyzed by Western blots. DTT indeed had its expected effects on the vv proteins; the core proteins 4a, p25 as well as the membrane proteins p21 and p16 migrated in their reduced form only in particles isolated from DTT-treated cells (Fig. 8). As expected, in the virions from control cells the same pattern of disulfide bonding was observed as described above (Fig. 8). Since in this particular experiment we used 10% instead of 15% SDS-PAGE, the dimer of 4a was much better separated from its monomer. Again, small amounts of the precursor of 4a were present in this virus preparation and it is more evident in this analysis that the dimer of 4a is substantially larger than the 110-kD precursor form.",

In these experiments the cells were not quenched with NEM before virus isolation since treatment of the IMV with DTT in vitro, followed by NEM or iodoacetamide incubation, completely abolished infectivity (data not shown). The average of three independent experiments showed clearly that the IMV isolated from DTT-treated cells had a title that was 10-fold reduced relative to virus isolated from control cells (Table II). We have shown before in several studies that when purified IMV is treated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C with 20 mM DTT, the membranes separate in part from the core (see 8, 50, 54). Structurally, this in vitro DTT treatment is very similar to what we observed with the virions isolated from DTT-treated cells. We next asked therefore whether isolated IMV treated with DTT in vitro was still infectious. Remarkably, and in contrast to the virus from DTT-treated cells, IMV that had been treated in vitro with DTT had the same title (and sometimes even slightly higher; not shown) as the untreated virus (Table II).

In vv life cycle DNA replication starts from 2 h after infection onwards, while late protein synthesis commences at 5\u20136 h of infection. The characteristic pattern of immunofluorescence at 6 h after infection is the complete overlap of the sites where viral DNA and late proteins accumulate. HeLa cells grown on coverslips were therefore infected with different multiplicity of infections (MOIs) ranging from 5 to 20 (see Materials and Methods) and fixed at 6 h after infection. The extent of infection was assayed by double indirect immunofluorescence using an antibody to vv cores (see Materials and Methods) that recognizes newly synthesized core proteins, as well as Hoechst dye to label the viral DNA. As expected, the cytoplasm of all cells were labeled for both DNA as well as the anti-core antibody when using virus from untreated cells, even at the lowest multiplicity of infection (Table III). Similarly, when this same virus preparation was treated with DTT in vitro all cells were infected at 6 h after infection (data not shown). However, when similar amounts of infectious units were used of virus from DTT-treated cells, even at the highest MOI the amount of cells showing DNA replication, as well as protein synthesis, was significantly reduced (Table III). More specifically, we found that, compared with control virus, at an MOI of 5 the percentage of DNA-positive cells was reduced by 73% and late protein-expressing cells by 98%. Apparently, the infection cycle of these viruses was severely delayed. ",

Highly purified IMV stocks were therefore bound to cells on ice and subsequently shifted to 37\u00b0C for 1 h. Bound (but nonpenetrated) particles were removed by trypsin treatment on ice (see Materials and Methods). Subsequently, the infected cells were lysed and the vv proteins analyzed under reducing and nonreducing condition using Western blots. Under these conditions the two core proteins 4a and p25 migrated exclusively at the position of the reduced form (Fig. 10). To our surprise, the membrane proteins p16 and p21 did not appear to become reduced during early times of infection. Instead both proteins migrated with a slightly higher molecular mass than their respective dimers seen under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 10). When analyzed after reduction these forms of both p16 and p21 migrated slightly slower than their respective monomers (Fig. 10). Since by 2-D gel analysis, these newly generated forms of p21 and p16 appeared to have the same pI as the proteins in isolated virions (not shown), we presume that this slower migration is due to a (unconventional) conformational change and not the consequence of their binding to some other (unknown) protein.

This is further supported by the fact that the mature form of the core protein 4a, that is made concomitant with the assembly of the IMV (30, 31, 41), forms dimers while its cytosolic precursor, p4a does not. The model that emerges from these results is that after the vaccinia virus has sealed, it is able to provide an environment within the particle that promotes the assembly of disulfide bonds of the core proteins, an environment that is inaccessible to GSH/GSSG, the cytoplasmic redox buffer. Indeed, treatment in vitro of purified IMV with concentrations up to 10 mM GSH failed to reduce the core proteins as analyzed by Western blots (data not shown).",

In vitro studies have shown that the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds depends on the conformation, as well as on the inherent disulfide oxidation-reduction potential of the protein (for example see 7). Intracellular disulfide bonding is influenced by the cellular redox potential, that is the consequence mainly of the ratio of reduced and oxidized glutathione. The redox state of the cytoplasm does not generally favor disulfide bond formation. However, based on the in vitro studies the putative disulfide bonding of proteins under cytosolic (reducing) redox conditions can be rationalized by assuming that the redox potential of the membrane proteins themselves must be higher than the cytosolic redox (for example see 6) and that, in addition, the conformation/organization of the proteins in the virally modified IC membranes favors the intermolecular disulfide bonding and folding. Consistent with the first idea could be the fact that, as analyzed by Western blots, the viral membrane proteins are highly resistant to reduction and that quantitative reduction requires the addition of 5% \u03b2-ME as well as high amounts of DTT (see also 49). This observation may also explain why cytosolic disulfide bonds of vv membrane proteins would naturally resist the (physiological) reducing environment of the cytosol.",

Apparently normal looking IMV particles that lack detectable disulfide bonds were seen in cells infected in the presence of DTT. These data imply that assembly per se is not dependent on disulfide bonding and must therefore rely on other types of protein interactions. However, the virions made in the presence of DTT were not completely assembled since they tended to loose their membranes in vivo and (more clearly) upon their isolation. Together with our recent data showing that treatment of purified virions with DTT opens up the viral membranes (which we argue are not fused into a continuous bilayer around the virus; see Fig. 1), these results clearly establish an important role of disulfide bonds in vv membrane proteins. Both the in vitro as well as the in vivo data show that in their absence the viral membranes are unable to remain tight around the particle and instead open up and detach from the underlying core. At present the reason why the three membrane proteins form homodimers as well as monomers is not clear. This phenomenon is obviously needed for the stability of the particle.",

An obvious idea that comes to mind is that disulfide bonding during assembly will generate a stable core, while reduction during entry makes it unstable and primes it for disassembly. However, some results are difficult to reconcile with this idea. For instance, in DTT treated cells the cores are reduced but do not seem to fall apart. Also, cores resist prolonged treatment of IMVs with DTT in vitro (unpublished observations) and DTT-treated IMVs retain full infectivity. And finally, it is known that when uncoating of the cores after entry in prevented, the cores may persist for hours in the cytoplasm (for example see 27). When the IMV infects cells a viral core particle indistinguishable from those produced by treating IMVs with NP-40 and DTT (23) appears in the cytoplasm. Within minutes this core starts to make a defined set of so-called early mRNAs, a process that has been extensively studied in vitro using NP-40/DTT-treated virions. From such studies it is clear that, in vitro, this process of early transcription requires a reducing environment (42). Although it is very likely that the process of transcription itself requires reducing conditions, we would like to propose that the reduction of the core may play a role as well. Such a role can for example consist of a conformational change of the core structure that is required to activate the transcription machinery (that is contained in the core; 40). Alternatively, such a structural change could (also) be needed to allow the newly synthesized mRNA to exit the core, a process that has been shown to occur in vitro (29). Since the questions of changes that accompany transcription in vitro or the overall process in vivo have never been seriously addressed, a testing of our proposed scenario would require further advances in our understanding if these aspects of vaccinia virus life cycle.",
