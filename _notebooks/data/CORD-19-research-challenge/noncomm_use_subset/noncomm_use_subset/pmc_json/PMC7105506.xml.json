It may not reflect the true number of deaths (numerator) and COVID-19 cases (denominator) occurred in each country. Given the difference of testing capabilities and public health response policy for detection of COVID-19 cases between countries, it is imperative to check the completeness of death reports following COVID-19, before making a comparison between the countries. It is also dependent on each country's surveillance performance to detect cases of COVID-19. It is speculated that most of asymptomatic or presymptomatic cases would not be tested for COVID-19 in many places, resulting in higher CFR by smaller denominator.",

In Korea, the low CFR, 1.3% as of March 25, 2020, could have resulted from the larger proportion of younger confirmed cases resulting larger denominator of low-risk population. Difference in age structure of affected population between countries may guide to the true burden of COVID-19 in terms of disease severity and fatality proportions. Age-specific or age-stratified CFR will be useful in comparing between the countries with different affected age groups. Table 1 shows number of deaths and age-specific CFRs of Korea, Italy, and China.25 Crude CFR in Korea appears to be one fifth lower than that of Italy (1.3% vs. 7.2%), but the difference between the two countries sharply decreases among the individuals older than 70. Thus, taking the age structure of confirmed cases into account is crucial for a fair comparison as it shows the difference in the age-adjusted CFR between the two countries is considerably reduced (2.4% vs. 4.2%).",

Fatal cases used to be ascertained as COVID-19 cases much earlier, and thus the denominator of the fatality rate should be the total number of cases confirmed at the same time as those who died in the numerator. That is, the denominator and the numerator of CFR should be composed of patients infected at the same time as those who died in order to accurately represent the actual CFR.6 Most of the recently diagnosed patients in many countries are still likely to be in the care-state. That is, the cross-sectional comparison of these figures may be biased since the time span for illness is different among countries during the course of the ongoing epidemic. To avoid this bias, time-delay adjusted estimates between symptom onset and death need to be calculated for a fair comparison of CFRs among different countries.7 Russell et al.8 proposed a delay-adjusted CFR to correct the delay between confirmation-and-death, using the distribution of the delay from hospitalization-to-death for cases that are fatal from Wuhan, China.",
