The levels of IFN\u2010\u03b3 were only associated with a fatal outcome and were not influenced by MeV, ADV\u2010B, or bacterial/fungal infection (Fig. 1A). The IFN\u2010\u03b3/IL\u201010 ratio suggests a relative balance in the type 1 and type 2 cytokines.32 The IFN\u2010\u03b3/IL\u201010 ratio was higher in non\u2010survivors, indicating a greater Th1 predominance in non\u2010survivors on the day of PICU admission. The ratio of IL\u20106 to IL\u201010 (IL\u20106/IL\u201010 ratio), which suggested a relative balance in pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines and anti\u2010inflammatory cytokines, showed no difference between non\u2010survivors and survivors. Higher levels of IL\u201010 were observed in non\u2010survivors or ADV\u2010B\u2010infected children, and lower levels of IL\u201010 were observed in MeV\u2010infected children (Fig. 1B). In addition, both the IFN\u2010\u03b3/IL\u201010 ratio and IL\u20106/IL\u201010 ratio were significantly increased in MeV\u2010infected children compared to in uninfected children (Fig. 1C,D). The higher IFN\u2010\u03b3/IL\u201010 ratio reflected lower IL\u201010 levels in MeV\u2010infected patients (Fig. 1A,B). The higher IL\u20106/IL\u201010 ratio reflected higher IL\u20106 (data not shown) and lower IL\u201010 levels in MeV\u2010infected patients (Fig. 1B).",

Recently, it has become possible to detect multiple virus genomes simultaneously, with high sensitivity using molecular detection techniques, such as multiplex\u2010PCR.

The detection frequency of MeV during the outbreak was significantly higher than after the outbreak (June 2014 to May 2015).

We found that the serum levels of IFN\u2010\u03b3 were associated with fatal outcome (Fig. 1, Table 5A). Considering the limited sample size, the results of logistic regression analysis (IC95 [0.999\u20101.039], P = 0.066) suggests that IFN\u2010\u03b3 is a predictor of fatal outcome. The AUC for a fatal outcome predicted by IFN\u2010\u03b3 levels was 0.778 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.656\u20100.899, showing moderately accurate prediction.
