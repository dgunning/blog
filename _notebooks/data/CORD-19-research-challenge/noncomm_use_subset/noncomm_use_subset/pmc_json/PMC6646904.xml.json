Even though the synthetic phage was viable, it proved unable to exploit cells without the ancestral LamB receptor, demonstrating that at least four J mutations were necessary for OmpF+. To find what further mutations might be needed to confer the OmpF+ phenotype, we constructed a second combinatorial library using the phage with the three critical J mutations as the baseline, and random combinations of 19 other J mutations found in the OmpF+ \u03bb evolved by Meyer et al. (2012). These 19 included six of the original 10 mutations. Four mutations were excluded because they occur within the two codons we already modified. Eighty\u2010eight OmpF+ isolates were sequenced from this much larger library. One OmpF+ isolate had just a single extra mutation at residue 1083 in addition to the three critical mutations (Fig. 1). However, the majority of the engineered OmpF+ phage did not possess this specific mutation, signifying that its function could be substituted by other J mutations. In total, this experiment revealed that four mutations are sufficient to evolve the innovation, but only two specific amino acid changes (at residues 1012 and 1107) are universally required to access OmpF in the context of these laboratory experiments.",

            "text": "Recall that 97% of substitutions in OmpF+ gain\u2010of\u2010function experiments occur in the specificity region. Likewise, the natural J homologs had disproportionate variation here: 29% of the total amino acid variation occurred in the specificity region, despite it only being 16% of the total length of J (Fig. 2A). As we will discuss later, peaks in amino acid variation correspond to peaks in indel variation (Fig. 2B). This nonrandom clustering of variation in the specificity region strongly suggests that J has experienced substantial diversifying selection on host attachment. Furthermore, the 17 residues with substitutions in the screened OmpF+ isolates (excluding a synonymous R989R substitution) were significantly more variable than randomly chosen groups of 17 residues from J (nonparametric bootstrap: P < 10\u22125) and from the specificity region 960\u20131132 (nonparametric bootstrap: P = 0.00075) showing the experiments had identified evolutionary hotspots. However, the specific 19 substitutions that evolved at these 17 residues in the laboratory were not common in natural homologs, suggesting that our experiments had the resolution to predict where changes would evolve, but not the exact change (Fig. S1). Focusing in on the two residues critical for the OmpF+ gain of function, 1012 and 1107, we find that they are more variable than random pairs of sites in J (nonparametric bootstrap: P = 0.00055) and the specificity region (nonparametric bootstrap: P = 0.020). Finally, we calculated evolutionary rates for each site in the specificity region, controlling for recombination (Fig. S3). We found that the 17 residues studied in the gain\u2010of\u2010function experiments evolve faster than equally sized random samples taken from the specificity region (nonparametric bootstrap, P = 0.012) and residues 1012 and 1107 evolve faster than random pairs of sites sampled from the specificity region (nonparametric bootstrap, P = 0.0086).",

We measured protein indel variation using gap entropy and found that most amino acid sites have none (mode and median gap entropy = 0), with a few notable exceptions. In the specificity region, we see four peaks in gap entropy (Fig. 2B) that correspond to peaks in sequence entropy (Fig. 2A). The purple and green peaks overlap residues 1012 and 1107, which are critical for the OmpF+ gain of function. The yellow and orange peaks occur at residues 1048 and 1077 that were not essential for OmpF use; however, \u03bb evolved many mutations during the experiment near these positions (residues 1048, 1049, 1053, 1076, 1077, and 1083). Indels can have large beneficial effects on proteins, including altering specificity by changing surface loops (Chatterjee and Rothenberg 2012; Porcek and Parent 2015), or causing structural rearrangements that improve function (Arpino et al. 2014). We hypothesize that the four peaks represent distinct surface loops that affect host specificity, much as influenza's hemagglutinin contains variable\u2010length surface loops that affect binding to avian and human host receptors (Peacock et al. 2017; Tzarum et al. 2017). Four additional peaks in gap entropy were observed in a region of J that did not evolve in the laboratory. Two particular peaks are notable because they are separated by a plateau caused by one indel nested within another.

Our hypothesis is supported if the J specificity region phylogeny is more similar to other \u03bb proteins than the phylogeny constructed from the adjacent J sequence. We computed phylogenies for all proteins in the \u03bb genome, and compared them using Robinson\u2013Foulds distance (which measures the topological distance between phylogenies) and geodesic distance (which takes both topology and branch lengths into account). When comparing phylogenies by Robinson\u2013Foulds distance, many distances could not be computed because some proteins were missing in many of the genomes. In fact, the failure of this calculation demonstrates a high rate of gene loss, duplication, and horizontal transfer in lambdoid viruses. When comparing phylogenies by geodesic distance, four distinct clusters of phylogenies are apparent, showing which proteins tend to be coinherited. Importantly, the J specificity region does not cluster with the phylogeny estimated from the remaining J sequence that encompasses structural domains (Fig. S5). From these analyses, as well as our visual observation of recombination in the J protein alignment (Data S1), we conclude that the specificity region is an evolutionary module that forms an independent functional unit distinct from the rest of J.",

Their correlated evolution suggests that there is functional dependence (epistasis) between the indels and that sites 1048\u20131049 and 1077\u20131078 play a role in host\u2010range evolution.",

To test this, we compared the length of branches on which indels occur to the length of all other branches. Indeed, the branches on which indels in those four regions occur are significantly longer than other branches of the specificity\u2010region phylogeny (Kruskal\u2013Wallis tests excluding zero\u2010length branches: P = 8.7\u22c510\u20137 in Fig. 3D; P = 5.6\u22c510\u201310 in Fig. S4).

It is thought that key innovations allow species to unlock new ecological opportunities, which in turn drives enhanced diversification rates (Mayr 1970). This should be recorded in phylogenies as a sudden increase in tree bushiness within monophyletic groups. Analyses that test correlations between subtree diversification rates and trait states have recently been found to be prone to false positives (Rabosky and Goldberg 2015). Given this finding, we took an alternative approach to test whether variation identified in our study leads to cladogenesis. Rather than focusing on bushiness, we evaluated whether indels tended to occur on longer branches. We reasoned that if the indels cause host shifts, then the lineages they occur in will uncover new ecological opportunities. This will have two important consequences, (1) the host\u2010shift may cause elevated rates of molecular evolution as the virus adapts to its new niche, and (2) lineages with different hosts will no longer compete with each other and will be more likely to coexist for deep evolutionary time. Each process would be recorded in the phylogeny as a correlation between innovative traits and the length of the branch they occur on. Indeed, there is overwhelming evidence that lineages that evolved indels at residues associated with an experimental host\u2010shift take longer to coalesce than other lineages. This demonstrates that changes associated with receptor usage are associated with ecological diversification.",

This explanation is unlikely given the evidence from gain\u2010of\u2010function experiments. If the critical residues were prone to mutation, then a diversity of substitutions at those residues should have been observed in the laboratory. Instead, those residues evolved in specific and parallel ways across replicate experiments, indicating the action of strong positive selection. Furthermore, if this variation was due to random mutations and not selection for functional changes, then we would not expect to observe an association between indel evolution and branch length.",

Presumably, the simplicity of Lenski's experiment leads the bacteria down evolutionary paths not taken in nature. By contrast, the dominant selection pressure in evolution experiments with bacteriophage\u2014attachment to bacterial host cells\u2014is probably also a dominant selection pressure on wild phage. Notably, another study on bacteriophage has observed residues under positive selection in both the lab and nature (Wichman et al. 2000), as have studies on canine parvovirus (Allison et al. 2014) and poliovirus (Stern et al. 2017). Apparently, the reverse strategy\u2013identifying candidate residues for changes in phenotypes in natural populations and then validation in the laboratory\u2013does not work as well, at least in one notable case (Liu et al. 2017). One reason put forth in Liu et al. (2017) for the failed nature\u2010lab connection are overlooked effects of higher order epistasis (Weinreich et al. 2013). Indeed, our methodology revealed that a four\u2010way interaction among the J mutations was required to endow new function on OmpF, and so we would not have been able to uncover them by typical methods that only measure the effects of single or pairs of mutations.",

Such an approach is in the same spirit as pioneering work by Barlow and Hall, who had success in predicting the evolution of antibiotic resistance by combining evolution experiments with analyses of natural and clinical isolates (Hall 2002; Barlow and Hall 2003; Hall 2004; Salverda et al. 2010). In particular, worrisome mutations can be identified with experiments as described here or with other laboratory techniques such as deep mutational scanning (Bloom 2017).
