            "text": "Many secretory proteins and peptides are initially synthesized as larger precursors, usually in the form of pre-pro-proteins. Such precursor proteins undergo post-translational proteolysis: the N-terminal pre-region, known as signal peptide, is cleaved by a well-characterized signal peptidase [reviewed in (Paetzel et al., 2002)], while various proteases liberate the active proteins from the pro-proteins. The following examples demonstrate the importance of the latter process and its regulation: (i) The envelope (Env) glycoprotein of HIV-1 is synthesized as a precursor polypeptide. In the trans-Golgi network, Env is cleaved by the cellular protease furin into two functional subunits. Cleavage of Env occurs at a conserved sequence. Mutagenesis of this sequence produces non-infectious HIV-1 particles containing unprocessed Env (Earl et al., 1991; Kowalski et al., 1987; McCune et al., 1988). This finding establishes the importance of furin-mediated processing for virus-infectivity. Accordingly, inhibitors of the host protease furin impede HIV-1 replication by interfering with the proteolytic processing of Env, suggesting they are useful for combating HIV-1 (Bahbouhi et al., 2002; Hallenberger et al., 1992; Kibler et al., 2004). Furthermore, inhibiting the production of peptides involved in various diseases by blocking the activity of the proteolytic enzymes is a promising approach (Basak, 2005; Bergeron et al., 2005; de Haan et al., 2004). (ii) The release of peptide hormones is subject to a complex and finely tuned regulation system. Post-translational proteolysis plays a key role by specifically converting the pro-hormone precursor into biologically active products. Examples of peptide hormones, whose proteolytic processing regulates their activities, are: insulin, somatostatin, parathyroid hormone, glucagon and GLP-1. Many of these are used as therapeutic peptides for treating various disorders.",

Experimental attempts to unveil the human plasma proteome using proteomics methods fail to detect most cytokines and protein hormones, presumably due to their low abundance [summarized in (Anderson et al., 2004)]. Currently, most computational approaches are protease-oriented and rely on proteolytic site data of specific enzymes (Blom et al., 1996; Cai et al., 1998; Kiemer et al., 2004; Yang and Berry, 2004). However, while proteolytic sites in a protein can be experimentally identified, for example, by N-terminal sequencing of the processed protein fragments, it is much harder to find out the catalyzing protease involved. Hence, only a limited number of experimentally verified proteolytic sites can be associated with a specific proteolytic enzyme, and therefore the data available as training sets for these methods is relatively limited.",

            "text": "Many of the proteolytic sites whose catalyzing enzymes are known are processed by members of one family of serine proteases, called pro-hormone convertases (PCs) (Seidah et al., 1998). All known proteolytic sites of mammalian PCs have an arginine or a lysine at the first position N-terminal to the proteolytic sites. Furthermore, no other enzyme that catalyzes the processing of proteins in the secretory pathway is known to cleave immediately after these basic amino acid residues. It is therefore reasonable to assume that proteolysis after a basic residue is catalyzed by a member of the PC family. This allows data extraction of sequences of proteins, which are processed by a PC member, from databases of precursor proteins and proteolytic sites. Such extracted data, together with the evolutionary relatedness between the members of the PC family, suggests that it might be possible to construct a classifier that will discriminate between PC proteolytic sites, regardless of the specific PC member, and other sites. Such an approach was taken by Blom and colleagues (Duckert et al., 2004), who extracted PC proteolytic sites based on Swiss-Prot (version 40) annotation. Herein, we describe an improved data extraction process, which considered more proteolytic sites. The extracted data was used for training classifiers, which are based on two different classification algorithms\u2014Random Forest and Support Vector Machines. The best classifier was used to provide a comprehensive list of predicted proteolytic sites in the mammalian secretome. Several interesting predictions of proteolytic sites are discussed.",

This process was performed twice: once by starting from the most N-terminal topology annotation, and once by starting from the most C-terminal topology annotation. Whenever discrepancies between the two completion processes were found, the Swiss-Prot entry was discarded. Such discrepancies point to mistakes in the topology annotation of multi-span proteins. Ideally, the extracted proteolytic sites should be divided into sites that are catalyzed by enzymes working in the secretory pathway, the extracellular matrix, the cytoplasm, the digestive system or in extracellular fluids.

They were then able to construct an artificial neural network-based classifier for predicting proteolytic sites catalyzed by members of the pro-hormone convertase family of proteases (Duckert et al., 2004). However, this procedure is too strict for part of the proteolytic sites. For example, human insulin (Swiss-Prot ID: INS_HUMAN) is composed of a signal peptide, followed by a PEPTIDE, a PROPEP and then another PEPTIDE. These two well-characterized proteolytic sites were ignored by the conservative extraction, because insulin has no PROPEP immediately after the signal peptide.

Such enzymes are often classified as members of the pro-hormone convertase family. Therefore, only sites with a lysine or arginine at the first position N-terminal to the proteolytic site were considered. We extracted all 30-mers of the secretome, arranged symmetrically around a potential proteolytic site after a basic residue, and designated them as follows: (i) Experimentally-validated proteolytic sites, which are annotated by a Swiss-Prot FT annotation line according to the word template \u2018SITE\u2026CLEAVAGE\u2019, were marked VALIDATED. (ii) Experimentally-validated proteolytic sites, whose existence is indicated by the annotation of the two protein segments right before and immediately after the proteolytic site, were also marked VALIDATED. The annotation for protein segments is in the form of Swiss-Prot FT annotation lines having the word template \u2018PEPTIDE (or PROPEPTIDE or CHAIN) [first residue] [last residue]\u2019, and the two segments of the protein should be consecutive, i.e. the first residue of the second segment immediately follows the last residue of the first segment. We do allow for a short linker section in between the two segments, provided that it is likely to be removed by exopeptidase E after the processing of the protein precursor by a pro-hormone convertase (Day et al., 1998; Friis-Hansen et al., 2001). We consider linker sections consisting of K, R, KK, KR, RK, RR, or successive Ks and/or Rs followed by a classical furin proteolytic site (RXKR or RXRR, where X is any natural amino acid) as likely to be cut by exopeptidase E. We also allow for a glycine to immediately upstream of the basic residue/s at the C-terminus of the first PEPTIDE, PROPEPTIDE or CHAIN, as it is likely that these peptides are substrates for C-terminal alpha-amidating enzymes that convert the peptides to the corresponding desglycine peptide amide, where glycine is the amide donor (Bradbury et al., 1982). The ambiguous sites (after each of the residues located in-between the two annotation lines) are marked AMBG. (iii) When only one PEPTIDE, PROPEPTIDE or CHAIN annotation line suggests the existence of a proteolytic site, our confidence in the proteolysis site is reduced and the site is marked POTENTIAL. (iv) When comments like \u2018PROBABLE\u2019, \u2018BY SIMILARITY\u2019 or \u2018POTENTIAL\u2019 (Farriol-Mathis et al., 2004; Junker et al., 1999) appear in the description of the FT lines in the cases described in (i) and (ii), the proteolytic site is designated as POTENTIAL. (v) When the distance between two proteolytic sites does not exceed four residues, the reliability of both sites is reduced. Such proteolytic sites are marked POTENTIAL unless there is strong support for their reliability. Strong support for one or both of the two proteolytic sites is considered if a proteolytic site is marked VALIDATED according to the criterion in (i). Strong support for one or both of the two proteolytic sites is also considered if a proteolytic site is marked POTENTIAL according to the SITE\u2026CLEAVAGE annotation line, and also marked VALIDATED according to the criterion in (ii). (vi) All other positions were marked NON (Table SI).",

A validation set consisting of a random quarter of the data was held out and used for parameter optimization. The rest of the data were used, once optimal parameters were chosen, in cross-validation to evaluate performance. When training, only the most reliable proteolytic sites, namely, sites that were marked VALIDATED, were used as positive examples, while a subset of the sites marked NON was used as negative examples. For the purpose of performance evaluation, on the other hand, it is important to use a set representative of all data.

For the classifier specialized in \u2018seen before\u2019 sites, we used a symmetrical window of 20 residues surrounding each site, a negative set 50 times larger than the positive set, and the internal weighting mechanism of RF was set to give a weight of 50 to the positive set, and 1 to the negative set.

Manual reviewing of many of the POTENTIAL sites suggests that this assumption is reasonable. We assume that most AMBG and NON sites are not proteolytic sites. Still, it is expected that yet undiscovered proteolytic sites are hidden among the sites marked NON or AMBG. The sheer volume of NON sites raises the suspicion that there are even more unknown proteolytic sites labeled NON than known proteolytic sites. This may distort performance evaluation statistics. We present below a calculation that attempts to tackle this problem.\n(1)(2)(3)(4)\nWhere TPi denotes instances in the positive set, correctly classified as positive, TPo represents mislabeled instances in the negative set, correctly classified as positive, Ti denotes instances in the positive set, To represents mislabeled instances in the negative set, and Po denotes instances in the negative set, classified as positive.

The calculated furin correction factor was found to be 1.11 for the \u2018seen before\u2019 classifier, and 3.04 for the \u2018new\u2019 classifier. Note that because of the inaccuracy of this correction procedure, corrected precision values may exceed 1. It must be emphasized that the furin correction factor is based on the assumptions that the ratio of annotated proteolytic sites to unannotated sites is equal for furin and other PC sites, and that classifier score distributions are mixtures as described above. Both these assumptions are very rough approximations. Still, we believe this correction gives a better evaluation of classifier performance. A comparison between the performance of RF and SVM classifiers specialized in \u2018new\u2019 sites is shown in Figure 2. The RF classifier performs better in the high precision/low recall area, while SVM performs better in the high recall/low precision area. Figure 2 also shows the effect of the furin correction factor on the raw score output of the RF and SVM classifiers.

Several groups reported proteolysis in FGF23 between Arg179 and Ser180, and mutations in proximity to this site (R179W, R179Q and R176Q) were identified in patients with autosomal-dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR) (Bowe et al., 2001; Shimada et al., 2002; White et al., 2000, 2001).

The amino-terminal region downstream of the signal peptide of the protein is involved in its retention in the Golgi apparatus and the regulation of its secretion (Kiefer et al., 1993). We predicted proteolytic sites in the N-terminus of human, mouse, zebrafish, chicken and xenopus FGF3. Indeed, in xenopus, proteolysis between Arg45 and Asp46 is essential for FGF3's biological activity (Antoine et al., 2000). We suggest that proteolysis of 10\u201327 N-terminal amino acids occurs during the maturation of other FGFs, and may be important for their biological activity. The multiple sequence alignment in Figure 4 confirms that the N-terminal proteolytic site is conserved between some FGF family members and in proximity to an upstream variable region. It is worth noting that the proteolytic site is conserved even among remote homologs. Some of these homologs possess an N-terminal signal peptide and are secreted via the classical secretory pathway, while others do not possess a signal peptide and are secreted via an alternative pathway (Nickel, 2003).\n",

Furthermore, the furin correction factor gives an estimate of the total number of proteolytic sites. We estimate the eukaryotic secretome to comprise about 7385 (1663 \u00d7 3.04 + 2099 \u00d7 1.11) proteolytic sites, which means that about 1.3% of R/K in the secretome are proteolytic sites (7385/(1663 + 569820 + 2099 + 1035) = 0.0129). An important conclusion is that currently only about half of the proteolytic sites are annotated [(1663 + 2099)/7385 = 0.509], meaning there is a great value for predictors of proteolytic sites.",

Furthermore, by relying on a well-characterized subgroup, namely furin sites, we were able to estimate the degree of mislabeling. As mislabeling is very common in perhaps most current biological data, we believe that our calculation is relevant for performance evaluation in other biological classification problems.",
