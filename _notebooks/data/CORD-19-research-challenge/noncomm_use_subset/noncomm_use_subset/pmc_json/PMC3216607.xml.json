This method was modified to label and detect only the first nucleotide after the cap. In order to use this approach to compare the relative proportions of m6Am and Am in cap structures from different sources, it was first necessary to establish the mobility of m6Am in the TLC assay and to demonstrate that T4 polynucleotide kinase does not preferentially label either of these nucleotides. As neither m6Am triphosphate or m6Am phosphoramidite are commercially available, a novel method for its synthesis and incorporation into RNA oligonucleotides was developed.",

The exposed 5' ends were dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase and after phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the mRNA transcripts were radiolabelled at their 5' end using T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of >20 fold excess of [\u03b3-32P] ATP. The labelled RNA was digested to monophospho-nucleotides by P1 nuclease prior to TLC separation. Using this method, new spots corresponding to the 2'-O methylated nucleotides are apparent in the labelled samples after cap removal (Fig 4A). A spot corresponding to pm6Am is readily detectable in all mRNA samples tested, and with pm6Am:pAm ratios of between 15:1 (brain) and 2:1 (liver) it appears that m6Am is more prevalent at the cap1 than is Am (Fig. 4A). Under these labelling conditions, where both ATP and polynucleotide kinase are in excess, the intensity of the spots corresponding to the unmodified nucleotides, as well as the other 2' methylated nucleotides, is indicative of their actual relative abundance in the de-capped mRNA sample (Supplementary Figure S1 online).",

This was then hybridised to single stranded DNA targets corresponding to the 5' region of selected messages. These DNA targets were first cross-linked to 2 mm \u00d7 2 mm teeth cut from a Hybond N+ membrane. After hybridization and washing, the membrane was subjected to phosphorimaging (Fig. 4B). The individual teeth containing the labelled mRNA gene-specific fragments were then removed and digested to nucleotide 5' monophosphates using P1 nuclease. These samples were individually spotted onto TLC plates and developed as described (Fig. 4B). Four mRNAs were chosen for analysis, apolipoprotein A-I (Apoa1, BC012253), albumin (Alb, BC024643), protamine 2 (Prm2, BC049612) and poly(A) binding protein cytoplasmic 1 (Pabpc1, BC046233). Alb and Apoa1 are predominantly liver expressed messages, whereas Prm2 shows testis specific expression and Pabpc1 is expressed highly in both organs. Pabpc1 may be subjected to translational regulation, but unlike Pabpc2, it is present in actively translating polyribosomes of mouse testicular cells31. For both Alb and Apoa1, the labelled nucleotide in the cap adjacent position included A, G, U and C, as well as m6Am and Am. This is consistent with multiple alternative transcription start sites at and around the Inr32. In both cases, Am and m6Am appeared as the major nucleotide modifications; unlike the mixed mRNA starting material, 2'-O-methylcytosine was not present (compare Fig. 4A, B). The m6Am:Am ratios were 1.65:1 and 1.4:1 for Apoa1 and Alb respectively, which is only slightly lower compared to that seen for the liver mRNA population as a whole. The Prm2 mRNAs from testis tissues almost exclusively had m6Am at the cap adjacent position (Fig. 4B). With an m6Am:Am ratio of 40:1, this was four times larger than the m6Am:Am ratio for the testis mRNA population as a whole. In contrast the cap adjacent nucleotides of Pabpc1 transcripts were predominantly unmodified, although a pronounced 2'-O-methyluridine was apparent in the sample from testis (Fig. 4B).",

In case of focused promoters the transcription start sites are contained within and around the Inr (YYANWYY), where the A is the principal start site and surrounding nucleotides are utilised to varying degrees6. Recent high-throughput sequencing from full length mRNAs, suggests that purine instead of A may be a better representation of the Inr consensus. However, most core promoters have several closely arrayed transcription start sites with different initiation rates rather than initiating at a single nucleotide32. Thus, most genes will give rise to a population of mRNAs that differ in their starting nucleotides. For example the Prm2 message initiates predominantly at the central A of the Inr as well as a second A 3 nucleotides upstream, whereas, Apoa1 strongly initiates at the A of the Inr but also uses surrounding U, G, C and sites at a significant level (Supplementary Figure S2 online) and (Fig. 4B).",

            "text": "Whilst there is evidence that cap1 methylation may increase translation efficiency1819, the consequences of converting a cap1 Am to m6Am are largely unknown. Some crystallographic observations suggest that the first nucleotide after the m7G may influence interaction with eIF4E or other cap binding proteins. Crystallographic analysis of eIF4E in a complex with the dinucleotide m7GpppG, show the G in a disordered arrangement34. However, with m7GpppA as substrate, the A interacts with a C-terminal loop of the protein35. A key interaction of this C-loop is a hydrogen bond between Thr205 and the amino group in the N6 position of the adenosine. It is this amino group that is targeted for methylation by the m6Am methylase. Thus, N6 methylation of a cap1 adenosine might influence the flexibility and orientation of the eIF4E C-terminal loop region. The ability to synthesize RNA oligonucleotides that containe m6Am in well-defined positions should facilitate future structure-function analysis. Therefore a direct synthetic method for the preparation of the desired m6Am phosphoramidite reagent, in a single step from commercially available starting material via direct N6-methylation, dramatically improves access to these materials for biological evaluation.",

Diammonium citrate (DAC) (100 mg) was dissolved in water (1 ml) and HPA (34.8 mg) was dissolved in 1:1 acetonitrile/water (1 ml). The HPA solution was filtered through Dowex-NH4+ and the DAC solution (100 \u00b5l) was added to prepare the matrix stock.
