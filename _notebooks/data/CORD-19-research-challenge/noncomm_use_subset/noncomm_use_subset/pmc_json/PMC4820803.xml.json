Approximately 60 000\u2013100 000 HFRS cases are reported each year worldwide, and the mortality rate can reach 10%1,4. Hantaviruses belong to the genus Hantavirus of the Bunyaviridae family, and they are enveloped, single-strand, negative-sense, tri-segmented RNA viruses. The viral genomes consist of large (L), medium (M) and small (S) segments that encode an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and two envelope glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) and a nucleocapsid (N) protein. Variations in the M and S segments may influence the antigenicity and virulence of hantaviruses5,6.",

RNAi technology is recognized as a promising, novel nucleic acid-based tool for use against various diseases, including cancer, infectious diseases and genetic disorders. RNAi reagents have also been reported to potently and specifically inhibit the replication of different viruses, including HIV, HBV11, HSV12, SAR-CoV13, influenza virus14,15, coxsackievirus16 and others. Thus, the development of RNAis as possible antiviral agents for hantavirus infection is of considerable interest17.",

However, the application of siRNAs has been limited by their short half-lives, the high costs of synthetic siRNAs and instability due to degradation by nucleases. Another method for inducing RNAi is via the transfection of plasmids that express antiviral short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), and this method is also an efficient means of eliciting RNAi in vivo15,21. Our results indicated that the shRNA expression plasmids pSilencer-S and pSilencer-M potently inhibited HTNV production in the cell lines at 72 hpi and even at 96 hpi in the newborn mice. These results provide a basis for the further development of siRNA expression plasmids for HTNV infection prophylaxis and therapy.",

            "text": "With the exception of ribavirin, no antiviral drugs for the treatment of hantavirus infection have been identified. Several members of the Bunyaviridae family, particularly HTNV, are sensitive to ribavirin8. We have reported that ribavirin can induce an up to 3.6-fold decrease in the vRNA level in HTNV infection at 4 dpi20, which is equivalent to the in vitro effects of pSilencer-S and -M observed in our experiments. With regard to the in vivo administration, the RNAi plasmid treatments increased the survival rate to 27.3% in a lethal HTNV-infected suckling mouse model. Zhou et al reported that the NP-specific siRNA expression plasmid pBabe-NP protected two of the eight mice (2/8) challenged with the lethal dose of avian influenza virus (H5N1) that killed all of the control mice15; this result is similar to the antiviral effects of the other siRNA expression plasmids against HTNV observed in our in vivo experiments. However, we noticed that ribavirin has been reported to be capably of affording 100% protection against lethal Andes virus infections in hamsters8 and also increases the survival rate to 81.8% in SEOV-infected suckling ICR mice23. The explanation of these phenomena may be related to the delivery of siRNA. The shRNA expression plasmid was distributed in the brain because the blood-brain barrier (BBB) of newborn mice is immature24. However, as a nonviral vector, the pSilencer shRNA expression vector does not readily cross the cellular membrane and is not stably introduced into the cells. Further studies are required to solve this problem, which is frequently considered a hurdle for the development of siRNA-based therapeutics25.",

The transfection of shRNA-encoding plasmids is probably best-suited for the treatment of acute viral infections, particularly among people infected with virus strains that are resistant to conventional antivirals and in cases of severe or re-emergent disease.
