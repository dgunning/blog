Several lines of experimental evidence suggest that maintaining or restoring endothelial barrier integrity can improve survival (9). For example, one study was conducted with transgenic mice engineered to overexpress I\u03baB\u03b1 in endothelial cells alone (10). Overexpression of I\u03baB\u03b1 blocks the activation of NF-\u03baB, which, when allowed to activate, translocates to the nucleus and leads to the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. When these mice were subjected to Escherichia coli sepsis, selective blockade of endothelial NF-\u03baB activation via overexpression of I\u03baB\u03b1 had no effect on the appearance of systemic cytokines and chemokines, but it prevented the development of endothelial dysfunction and multiorgan failure and improved survival (10). This and other studies suggest that treatments targeting the endothelial response to sepsis might improve survival. The same might be true for Ebola virus disease.",

In older adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (a disease also characterized by endothelial dysfunction), an observational study suggested that inpatient treatment with statins and ARBs reduced 30-day all-cause mortality by 32% and 53%, respectively (14). (For most of these patients, outpatient treatment was continued after hospital admission.) However, in patients with sepsis-related acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring intensive-care unit (ICU) admission and mechanical ventilation, randomized controlled trials of statin treatment have shown no improvement in survival (15). In these patients, statin treatment was probably \u201ctoo little, too late.\u201d To be effective, statins probably have to be started earlier, as suggested by the findings of a randomized controlled trial of 100 patients hospitalized with early sepsis (16). At the time of enrollment, none of the patients had evidence of organ failure and all had been statin naive for at least 2 weeks. As soon as they were hospitalized, they were treated with either atorvastatin (40 mg/day) or a placebo. The trial showed that atorvastatin reduced the occurrence of multiorgan failure by 83%, a result that was likely due to stabilization of endothelial function.",

Favipiravir is a nucleoside polymerase inhibitor that in vitro and animal studies have shown to have antiviral activity against Ebola viruses. In 69 PCR-positive adults and adolescents of \u226514 years of age, a loading dose of favipiravir (6,000 mg orally) was given in divided doses on day 1, and then 1,200 mg was given twice a day for the next 9 days. Ebola virus loads were determined by cycle threshold (CT) values, with CT values of <20 and \u226520 indicating high and low virus loads, respectively. Mortality rates after 14 days in consecutively treated patients were compared with those in untreated patients seen in the two units during the previous 3 months. Among favipiravir-treated patients with low virus loads, mortality was 15%, compared with 30% in historical controls. However, among treated patients and historical controls with high virus loads (approximately 40% of all treated patients), mortality rates in both groups were 85%.

Nonetheless, local physicians were able to treat consecutively approximately 100 patients with laboratory-confirmed Ebola virus disease at the 34 Military Hospital in Freetown, the Port Loko Government Hospital, the Hastings Ebola Treatment Centre, and other sites in Sierra Leone. Patients were given atorvastatin (40 mg/day) and irbesartan (150 mg/day). Reports indicate that rapid clinical improvement was seen in almost all patients, and only two who were inadequately treated are known to have died (O.M.R., unpublished observations). One was critically ill when first seen and died soon thereafter. The other initially responded to 3 days of combination treatment, but when treatment was stopped and he was given an antiviral agent, he relapsed and died.",

All patients were treated with intravenous fluids and oral rehydration solution. The case fatality rate was 47.7% during the period from 20 September 2014 to 13 October 2014, but it declined to 23.4% during the period from 5 November 2014 to 7 December 2014. The authors could not explain this 51% decrease in mortality. Interestingly, reports from 34 Military Hospital and the Port Loko Government Hospital in November suggested that atorvastatin and irbesartan treatment was associated with improved survival, and some patients at the Hastings Center were also given the same treatment during November (O.M.R., unpublished observation). Ansumana et al. did not acknowledge this in their report (22). Perhaps atorvastatin and irbesartan treatment of some of these patients helps explain the decrease in the Ebola case fatality rate observed at the Hastings Center.",

The candidates who should be considered for treatment with statins and angiotensin receptor blockers are Ebola patients cared for in hospitals and other treatment units that are staffed by trained health care workers, Ebola patients treated at home, health care workers (to prevent severe illness in those who are at high risk and might become infected while caring for Ebola patients), family caregivers and other close contacts, and community surveillance and burial workers. The primary goal of treatment is to reduce patient mortality. Secondary goals are to reduce requirements for fluid and electrolyte replacement and prevent severe disease in health care workers and other contacts who become infected. Treating all patients consecutively would be the most straightforward approach, and results could be compared with those seen in historical controls. Clinical oncologists often use the same approach when they evaluate new treatments, and it can be highly efficient. For example, if the goal is to achieve a statistically significant (95% confidence interval) reduction in case fatality rates from 50% to 25%, only 52 patients would have to be treated. One problem with this method is uncertainty about mortality rates in historical controls in settings where better supportive care has already improved survival. This concern has already led to uncertainty about the results of the favipiravir study in Guinea (21). If clinical record keeping in the centers in Sierra Leone where Ebola patients were treated had been adequate, a matched-set case-control study might be used to retrospectively evaluate the effectiveness of atorvastatin and irbesartan treatment.",

The combination of statins and ARBs might eventually be used to treat other filovirus infections. These agents might find a place in treating dengue hemorrhagic fever, hantavirus infections, and severe acute respiratory syndrome/Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infections. Observational studies have already suggested that statins and ARBs may reduce mortality in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (14) and that statins may reduce mortality in patients with influenza (24). Combination treatment might be especially useful for a global response to an avian influenza pandemic. It might also find use in treating nonviral diseases, such as pneumococcal sepsis and severe malaria, and it might provide an effective medical countermeasure against potential agents of bioterrorism, such as those for smallpox, plague, and anthrax (24).
