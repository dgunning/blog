By 26 December 2014, MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the causative agent of MERS, had infected 941 people and caused at least 347 related deaths (mortality rate \u223c37%) (http://www.who.int/csr/don/26-december-2014-mers/en/). MERS-CoV utilizes bat and camels as natural reservoirs and intermediate transmission hosts, respectively.2,3,4,5,6 MERS-CoV can spread through close contact or airborne transmission, causing serious public health problems.7,8 As such, the development of effective vaccination strategies to prevent MERS-CoV infection and disease is urgently needed.9,10",

For example, Freund's adjuvant, an oil emulsion, may induce strong immune responses, but is not suitable for human use because of its toxicity.23 While aluminum salts (Alum) are licensed for human use as an adjuvant in the United States, they do not efficiently enhance the Th1-type of humoral and cellular immune responses that are important to combat viral pathogens.24 Adjuvant System 04, a new generation Toll-like receptor (TLR)-based adjuvant which combines the TLR4 agonist MPL (3-O-desacyl-4\u2032-monophosphoryl lipid A) and Alum, is licensed for use in the human papillomavirus vaccine, Cervarix.25,26 AS03, which consists of Tocopherol, Squalene, and Polysorbate 80, is approved for use with human influenza A virus vaccines (http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/VaccineSafety/ucm376465.htm).27 Monophosphoryl lipid A (mPLA), an adjuvant extracted from lipopolysaccharide, may enhance immune responses induced by influenza vaccines and is superior to Alum for cancer, HBV, malaria and HPV vaccines, but how to achieve the consistency of preparing mPLA-formulated vaccines remains a challenge.23,28 Montanide ISA51, an adjuvant approved for use in humans in Europe, has been shown to promote antigen-specific antibody responses with strong neutralizing activity against a variety of pathogens.15,29,30 MF59, another adjuvant licensed for human use in Europe, has a well-established ability to promote immunogenicity of influenza virus vaccines with a safety profile in human populations comparable to that of Alum or Montanide ISA51/720. In addition, increased immunogenicity was seen in MF59-adjuvanted influenza A virus vaccine in elderly people compared to a conventional subunit vaccine.31,32,33",

In the absence of any adjuvant, S377\u2013588-Fc alone induced antibody responses after two or three immunizations, suggesting that the Fc fragment when fused with the RBD protein potentiated the immune response induced by the RBD-based vaccine. As expected, mock immunization with PBS did not result in any induction of detectable MERS-CoV-specific antibodies (Figure 2a).",

In the absence of an adjuvant, S377\u2013588-Fc alone could induce readily detectable MERS-CoV S1-specific IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies with a slight bias towards Th2-type (IgG1) response (Figure 3). However, addition of any given adjuvants tested modulated IgG subtype responses. Specifically, we noted that unlike other adjuvants, including Freund's, Alum, mPLA-SM and ISA51, none of which promoted S377\u2013588-Fc-induced IgG1 responses, the usage of MF59 as an adjuvant significantly enhanced both IgG1 and IgG2a subtypes of antibody (Figure 3a and b). Despite their failure to further promote IgG1 subtype responses, Freund's and ISA51 adjuvants, like MF59, could significantly increase the IgG2a (Th1) antibody response (Figure 3b). Further analysis of Th1-versus-Th2 antibody responses revealed that mice immunized with MF59-adjuvanted S377-588-Fc, similar to those immunized with S377\u2013588-Fc alone, exhibited specific IgG antibody responses which were slightly Th2 (IgG1) biased, whereas those immunized with Alum- and, particularly, mPLA-SM-adjuvanted S377\u2013588-Fc protein more strongly elicited a Th2 (IgG1)-biased response(Figure 3c). Taken together, among the adjuvants tested, MF59 seemed to be the most potent adjuvant in augmenting the specific antibody response elicited by the MERS-CoV RBD subunit vaccine, enabling the induction of strong and more generalized IgG subtype antibody responses.",

Specifically, a standard neutralization assay was performed in microtiter plates using DPP4-expressing Vero E6 cells. We found that immunization with S377\u2013588-Fc protein alone was capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies to an extent similar to that of Freund's-adjuvanted S377\u2013588-Fc, suggesting that addition of Freund's adjuvant to the vaccine formulation has little advantage on improving the neutralization antibody response in immunized mice (Figure 5). In contrast, we noted that S377\u2013588-Fc protein formulated with Alum, ISA51, mPLA-SM and especially MF59 significantly increased the titers of neutralization antibody. Among five adjuvants evaluated, MF59, mPLA-SM and Freund's appeared to represent the most, the second and the least potent ones, respectively, to promote the production of neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice. As expected, we did not identify neutralizing antibody in sera obtained from mock-immunized mice (Figure 5). Because of its superior capacity to trigger highly prominent neutralizing antibody responses, when compared to other adjuvants tested, we believe that the usage of MF59 in the MERS-CoV S377\u2013588-Fc protein can be further developed to achieve an optimal MERS-CoV RBD protein-based vaccination strategy.",

The potential mechanisms of action of these adjuvants are notably different. Alum, for example, mainly stimulates innate immunity by promoting antigen uptake and presentation and upregulating major histocompatibility complex class II molecules CD40 and CD86, or by inducing Th2 cells to mediate B-cell differentiation and to secrete IgG1 subtype and IgE antibody.49,50 mPLA, an agonist of TLR4, suppresses inflammatory immune responses by stimulating TLR4, and promoting monocytes to produce IL-10. mPLA functions through a bias toward the Toll-interleukin 1 receptor domain-containing adapter inducing interferon-\u03b2-signaling.51,52 MF59 adjuvant is reported to increase antigen uptake by APCs, to induce a local immunostimulatory environment by recruiting key immune cells, such as CD11b+ and MHC class II+ cells, to the injection site, and to enhance transport of antigen to lymph nodes.53,54 MF59 may also promote an early CD4+ T-cell response, allowing for better recall responses and long-term persistency of protective antibody responses.55,56",

Indeed, we found that S377\u2013588-Fc-induced immune responses could be further improved by incorporating some adjuvants, such as MF59. When formulated with MF59 adjuvant, S377\u2013588-Fc induced high levels of IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies with strong neutralizing activity (Figure 3 and 5), suggesting that both Th1 (IgG2a) and Th2 (IgG1) antibody responses may play roles in inhibiting MERS-CoV infection. However, we could not exclude the possibility that Th2 (IgG1) antibody may play a dominant role in neutralizing MERS-CoV infection. It was reported that IgG1 is the main subclass induced after West Nile virus infection of humans and IgG1 accounts for most of the in vitro neutralization capacity.57 But we did not observe similar phenomenon in this study on MERS-CoV infection. For example, mPLA-SM-adjuvanted RBD induced significantly lower IgG1 antibody than MF59-adjuvanted RBD (Figure 3a), while the antibodies from both groups exhibited equally potent neutralizing activity (Figure 5). Therefore, further study on this issue is warranted. Unlike other adjuvants tested, MF59 promoted rapid increases in IgG antibody after two immunizations with S377\u2013588-Fc protein. Antibody levels did not significantly increase after further boosting (Figure 2), suggesting that two doses of immunization is sufficient when MF59 adjuvant is used.",

MF59, an oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant that activates non-TLR sensing receptors, is the first adjuvant licensed for human use after Alum. MF59 is superior to Alum and other adjuvants in inducing antibody responses against antigens of viruses such HIV, HBV, HCV, HSV-2 and influenza viruses.66 It is an effective and safe vaccine adjuvant approved in Europe for use with influenza vaccines.53,67 Unlike Alum, MF59 vaccine adjuvant has been widely used in clinical trials of influenza vaccines, particularly after the outbreak of the 2009 H1N1 influenza, and demonstrated a high safety profile and strong immunogenicity in enhancing and broadening protection against influenza virus infections.68,69 Because of its strong efficacy in potentiating the immunogenicity of influenza virus antigen, MF59 allows for antigen dose sparing and is able to increase seroconversion and cross-protection after vaccination with only two doses.70 Therefore, pandemic influenza vaccines with MF59 have been prioritized since antigen dose-sparing and enhancing cross-reactive antibody titers are critical in the event of a pandemic or epidemic.71 Here we showed that although mPLA-SM-adjuvanted MERS-CoV RBD protein also induced stronger neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV infection than most of the other adjuvants tested (Figure 5), its efficacy was significantly lower than that of MF59 (Figures 2\u20134). Moreover, this adjuvant was seen to elicit only modest effects on antibody responses to an HIV vaccine,72 and caused inflammation in mice as discussed above, making it less appealing than MF59.",
