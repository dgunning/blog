            "text": "Avian astroviruses belong to the genus Avastrovirus of the Astroviridae family. The viral particles are small, non-enveloped, positive sense RNA viruses, 28 to 30nm in diameter, and have a star-like morphology (21). Turkey Astrovirus type 1 (TAstV-1) was first described in 1980 by McNulty et al. (22) in the United Kingdom, and the first isolated of TAstV in the United States was identified in 1985 (15). A second TAstV type, which was antigenically and genetically distinct from the previously identified as TAstV-1, was isolated 1996 and designated as TAstV-2 (13,31,32). The entire genome sequence of the TAstV-2 isolate, NC/96, has been reported and bears many similar features to Human Astrovirus (HAstV) (15). Moreover, astroviruses are linked with enteric disease in humans and young animals such as calves, lambs, pigs, dogs, cats and minks (15,21). The most important infectious disease caused by TAstV are the enteric diseases affecting the digestive tract of commercial poults proposed to result in more economic loss than those affecting any other system reported worldwide, including Brazil (16,17,26,27,28,30,34,35). In addition, no vaccine currently exists for the enteric disease caused by astroviruses, which leads the disease to the bio-security manners to control virus infection and spread (15).",

Based on the climatic characteristic, these two regions are totally opposite from each other. The producer region chosen for the present study is characterized by high relative humidity during the summer and dried winter, mean monthly temperatures ranged 30\u00baC, localized in South Eastern of the country. The samples were collected in 5 times point, along the year from February to December, including summer and winter. The flocks aged \u2245 30 days, distant from each other 2 Km, presenting more than 10.000 birds in a large growing scale under straight bio-security manners, presenting 10% of mortality in average were included on this study. The samples were collected monthly by specialized veterinarians, and sent to Laboratory under -4\u00baC for virology investigation. The general description of the common symptoms observed during the disease course was collected by a questionnaire filled at the time of each collection and characterized as being depression, huddling, dehydration, stunted growth and loss of appetite.

The non coincidence between number of collected organs and number of studied poults was due to time after death. So, by macroscopic evaluation only organs without necrosis were used for the study. Half of each organ was kept under -86\u00baC as a source of original virus, and the other half readily submitted to prepare the respective tissue suspension (34). The respective cloacal swabs (CS; n=500), faeces (n=500) and sera (n=500) were collected from symptomatic birds stored under -86\u00baC until its use. The criterion of inclusion used was: prevalence of at least 25% for both viruses, a confidence interval (CI) of 95% and a mean flock size of 5000 birds (range 1.000-10.000). In order to determine the major risk factor involved (climatic conditions) in disseminate both viruses amongst turkeys from the same flock, the CS and respective faeces were assayed, and the results compared according to percentage of positives (winter and summer) found by both RT-PCR approaches.",

For the Coronavirus (TCoV) detection, a set of primers used were a combination of UTR11-/UTR41+ which are incriminated to produce a very sensitive RT-PCR (6). Before the RT-PCRs had been performed all total RNA were heated during 3 min at 100\u00baC, followed by 2 min at 72\u00baC and finally 2 min at 50\u00baC (34).

The present study, clinical signs were described as marked accumulation of liquid in the small intestine, liquid and/or frothy cecal contents, and wet rectal contents, similar to those described before (27,28). Likewise, affected flocks ceased growth and often lost weight for an extended of period, as reported by Culver et al. (8). The specimens analysed here were from turkeys aged 1 month or less, in spite of many reports have been showed the prevalence of TCoV upon 30 days and TAstV-2 in the two first weeks of life (13).",

The same analysis has been reported in England and Wales, when 52% and 70% for TCoV and TAstV-2 was evidenced from turkeys using the simplex RT-PCR assay (1,9). Otherwise, the ileum-caeca junction was able to increase the chance of detect viral RNA, when compared to faeces for the same analysis by the use of a multiplex RT-PCR performed in a single tube reaction (18,29) In addition, the multiplex RT-PCR is widely used for epidemiological studies in USA, showing efficiency and specificity when an internal control template (29). Moreover, this is the first study reporting the applicability of multiplex RTPCR performed on different clinical material. Interesting, the TAstV-2 could be detected, for the first time in sera collected from naturally infected poults, demonstrating early stages of virus infection characterized by viremic phase, only reported in experimentally infection (17,26).",

In spite of bio-security measures implemented elsewhere, the TCoV and TAstV-2 control in endemic areas has proven to be difficult (25). In a recent study, periodic monitoring of commercial turkey for enteric viruses has indicated continuous presence of astrovirus among healthy flocks (25). Otherwise, recent TCoV outbreak in North Carolina, a potential vector has been indicated responsible for spread the virus, since the incidence of infection increase during summer months, coinciding with increased fly populations (3). Besides, the outbreak observed in Wales and England in summer 2004 was probably occasioned by multi-age farms management, when the simple rescheduling of production resulted in a substantial reduction in number of affected birds (9). As shown by the results, in tropical countries the incidence of the same disease was observed during winter season, as reported by Teixeira et al. (28,30) and Villareal et al. (35). Concern about sequencing, recent work has demonstrated that genetic differences on TAstV-2 capsid gene do not promote any different enteric disease (26). In this way, the infection of TAstV-2 may affect the immune system by causing bursal lymphoid depletion, which can explain the positive results obtained from this tissue. Recently, it has demonstrated young poults affected by Poult Enteritis Complex (PEC) showing impairment of lymphoid organs (28,30). Furthermore, TAstV-2 and TCoV has been described to co-circulate among different species (4,12). However, more studies are still necessary to explain this mechanism associated to others enteric pathogens among Brazilian flocks (35).",
