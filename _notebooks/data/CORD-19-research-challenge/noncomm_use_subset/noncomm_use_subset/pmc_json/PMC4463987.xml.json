Major conditions contributing to severe illness include sepsis, pneumonia, meningitis and diarrhoea (Liu 2012; Seale 2014). Early recognition of severe illness with prevention of cardiorespiratory arrest through resuscitation represents a critical step towards reducing mortality and long-term disability in seriously ill newborns and children. However, the clinical diagnosis of severe illness can be difficult, as signs are often non-specific and deteriorate rapidly.",

Advanced Paediatric Life Support (APLS), a three-day course, was developed and piloted in the UK in 1992. Two other courses - the one-day PLS course and Prehospital PLS - have been designed to complement the APLS (Jewkes 2003). The World Health Organization (WHO) has added to this list the three and one-half-day ETAT course based on and validated against the APLS course in Malawi (Gove 1999; Molyneux 2006). This course is specifically aimed at low-income countries and is intended to improve prompt identification and institution of life-saving emergency treatment for very ill children.",

Although these courses concentrate on community-based or out-patient-based management, with good evidence for their success (Sazawal 2001), they also include guidance on management of very severe illness. These disease-specific training approaches were incorporated into the broader package of the IMCI strategy. Here the particular focus for management of the very ill child is the decision to provide prereferral care and referral to hospital. In addition to this, the WHO has developed a specific five-day course on hospital management of severe malnutrition (WHO 2002).",

Apart from the sometimes high costs of providing courses (often recovered in high-income countries with high course fees), attendance at such courses often means that important staff are absent from their normal duties with potential disruption to patient care and, for some, loss of personal income (Jabbour 1996). Despite their high costs, emergency care courses remain a thriving enterprise in many high-income countries, as is reflected in their ever increasing number and variety (Jewkes 2003). In the hope that they might improve the quality of care in low- and middle-income countries, considerable global efforts and investments have gone into further development, refinement and adaptation of these courses to meet the needs of individual countries (Baskett 2005). Yet despite these investments and the faith placed in them by many organisations and institutions, evidence of their effectiveness in improving treatment of seriously ill newborns and children remains unclear. Several studies on in-service emergency care training for newborns and children have been completed since our original review was published, in 2010. Therefore an updated review of the effectiveness of these courses is needed.",

            "text": "Reported benefits should be interpreted with caution. First, in Opiyo 2008, assessment of outcomes was conducted immediately after training for a short period (50 days). Therefore instantaneous improvement in provider performance could have been expected. Clinical skills have been shown to 'decay' over time, with as much as a 50% reduction in appropriate practice (as assessed in classroom simulations) within six months of intense training (McKenna 1985). Assessment of training effects over a longer time could have improved our confidence in the results. The potential for a \u2018decay effect\u2019 underscores the need for periodic refresher training to maintain recommended provider practice. Second, in Senarath 2007, a large number of health providers demonstrated appropriate newborn care practices at baseline. The narrow \u2018performance improvement' gap possibly limited demonstration of the real impact of the training. Third, training coverage was low in Opiyo 2008 and unclear in Senarath 2007. Saturation training to the level of that reported in one excluded study (94%) (El-Arifeen 2004) can potentially create a \u2018herd effect\u2019 on provider practices. Thus, possible mediation of reported effects by level of training coverage cannot be excluded. Finally, none of the included studies examined implementation costs. Thus, whether the observed benefits of training interventions are worth the costs remains uncertain.",

Apart from the clear effect on costs, training duration may modify their impact: One review (Rowe 2008) (n = 2 studies) found marginal effectiveness of standard IMCI training (\u2265 11 days) compared with shortened IMCI training (five to 11 days). The complexity of the targeted behaviour may also modify training effects: Practices such as holding the baby upside during resuscitation may be easier to change than complex ones such as performing bag-valve-mask resuscitation. In Opiyo 2008, the teaching strategy consisted of focused lectures and practical scenario sessions using an infant manikin, and in Senarath 2007, the strategy involved lectures, demonstrations, hands-on training and small group discussions. The format of training courses could influence their effect: One review found mixed interactive and didactic/lecture-based educational meetings to be more effective than didactic meetings or interactive meetings (Forsetlund 2009).",

First, a large number of studies were excluded on the basis of weak design (lack of appropriate controls, retrospective surveys). Most of the available evidence is therefore unreliable because of high risk of bias. Second, the lack of rigorous studies could be due to design and ethical challenges in the evaluation of educational interventions in practice settings. Desirable features such as protection against contamination cannot be fully achieved within routine clinical settings. In addition, random assignment of health providers and sick babies to a control arm and observation of practices performed by untrained providers raise clear ethical concerns. Third, effective sample sizes will always be difficult to achieve, as severe illness episodes and resuscitation events remain relatively uncommon events in practice. Large multi-centre studies with relatively long observation periods would be needed to effectively assess the effects of emergency care courses. Apart from high costs, such studies would have to contend with the difficulty of securing continued availability and participation of health providers.",
