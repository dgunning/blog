Recent studies have suggested that certain microbial colonization patterns prevalent already in early childhood may affect the risk of bronchiolitis and precede the development of persistent wheeze or asthma.35 Furthermore, the severity of the acute respiratory infections may be modulated by the type of microbial community in the airways independent of RSV or RV coinfection, while at the same time, both RSV and RV may increase the severity of the infection independent of the bacteria.34 It has also been shown that antibiotic treatment during acute wheezing episodes in childhood greatly decreases the duration of the symptoms, thus pointing toward microbial effects.36 Likewise, a study of 1005 infants demonstrated that certain airway microbiota profiles seemed to increase the severity of bronchiolitis.37 The rate of intensive care use and the length of hospital stay during the episode of acute bronchiolitis were particularly high in infants with a Haemophilus\u2010dominant profile but low in infants with a Moraxella\u2010dominant profile. This, although low in statistical power, was especially apparent in children with RSV bronchiolitis but not found for RV bronchiolitis. In a small randomized trial of 40 children hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis, treatment with azithromycin during the acute episode seemed to alleviate the subsequent risk of long\u2010term respiratory morbidity.38\n",

At the same time, pro\u2010inflammatory innate immune responses are not very prominent as anti\u2010inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)\u201010 and transforming growth factor (TGF)\u2010beta, prevail since during pregnancy mother's immune system protects the fetus.49 As a consequence, T helper1 (Th1) cell skewing cytokines such as IL\u201012 seem to develop rather slowly in young infants, even in the presence of TLR\u2010ligating viruses and increased type I interferon production.50, 51 Interestingly, the cytokines IL\u20106 and IL\u201023, both potent inducers of IL\u201017\u2010producing T cells, were found to be increased in TLR\u2010stimulated neonatal cells and neonates were shown to have increased numbers of Th17 cells (Figure 4A).52 As enhanced pathology following RSV infections is often associated with increased IL\u201017 production and this cytokine is more prominent in neonates, the presence of this cytokine may contribute to a more severe disease state.53, 54 In addition, studies in neonatal mice have shown that there is a spontaneous early wave of innate cytokines such as IL\u201033, a Th2 skewing cytokine, and a recruitment of innate lymphoid cells (ILC)\u20102 into the lungs that reach the maximum at day 14 after birth.55, 56\n",

RV type A frequently causes lower respiratory tract infection, and RV type C in particular is linked to severe wheezing in infected children.8, 13, 61 The increased risk of severe RV infection with wheeze in young children with a strong family history of allergy and asthma may be explained by a partial defect in mucosal antiviral innate interferon responses, due potentially to early allergic airways inflammation (Figure 4B). The airway mucosa of asthmatics, who have allergic airway inflammation, has been shown to be associated with reduced type I and type III interferon responses.62, 63 To understand the particularly high pathogenic potential of RV\u2010C, it is important to note that CDHR3 has recently been identified as a unique receptor for RV\u2010C.18 Interestingly, a polymorphism in the CDHR3 gene (resulting in a higher expression of CDHR3 on the epithelial surface) was associated with the increased risk of childhood asthma.27 RV\u2010C has also evolved specific molecular tools to reduce IFN\u2010\u03b2 expression and downstream signaling in airway epithelial cells,64 which may possibly explain the more severe course of respiratory RV\u2010C infections. In addition, RV infections of airway epithelial cells are strong inducers of type 2 innate cytokines, such as IL\u201025 and IL\u201033, which subsequently initiate or boost type 2 immunity in the lungs via IL\u20105\u2010 and IL\u201013\u2010producing innate lymphoid cells (ILC) 2 and Th2 cells (Figure 4B). Surprisingly, the induction of innate cytokines by RV infections was stronger in airway epithelial cells from asthmatics compared to healthy controls.65 Also, the induction of type 2 innate cytokines may be more pronounced during early childhood, as compared to adult mice, human rhinovirus infections in neonatal mice showed more pronounced IL\u201013 and IL\u201025 expression, mucus secretion, and airway hyperresponsiveness.66 This process may be further boosted or co\u2010inciding by an early spontaneous wave of IL\u201033\u2010dependent type 2 cytokines and cells in developing lungs of neonatal mice.55, 56 Overall, although RV infections are linked to the induction of milder epithelial inflammation than RSV infections, they tend to reduce type I IFN expression and cause inflammation with Th2 cell characteristics, disrupted tight junction expression, and high cytokine levels that promote bronchospasm, edema, and mucus production and lead to airway obstruction and wheeze.1, 41\n",
