Variant strains emerge due to changes in the IBV genome through point mutations, deletions, insertions or RNA recombination and these variants are often responsible for IB outbreaks in vaccinated chicken flocks (Cavanagh and others 1988, Jia and others 1995, Liu and others 2007). Many countries have shown that multiple variant IBV strains are circulating in their poultry flocks (de Wit and others 2011).",

In most cases, severe respiratory distress and renal lesions with high mortality were observed in vaccinated flocks affected by these strains. It appears that the conventional H120 vaccines alone do not provide sufficient protection from these strains (Meir and others 2004, Kahya and others 2013). However, development of vaccines against each of these new variants is not generally an option due to the high cost and time required for product registration (Jackwood and others 2003, Bijlenga and others 2004). Furthermore, it could be a never-ending race as new variant IBVs are constantly emerging in major poultry producing countries. Instead, it has been recommended that protection conferred by available live IBV vaccines against new variants should be constantly evaluated (Alvarado and others 2003). Vaccination with one serotype does not ensure complete protection from heterologous strains (Cook and others 1999) but the use of different combinations of live IBV vaccines has been shown to be able to induce high and broad protection from challenges with several heterologous virulent IBV variants (Gelb and others 1991, Cook and others 1999, Cook and others 2001, Alvarado and others 2003, Martin and others 2007, Terregino and others 2008).",

It must be noted that the vaccine programme given to group II also offered 100 per cent kidney protection from both isolates. In a previous study performed in specific pathogen-free chicks, live H120 vaccination afforded protection of the trachea (92 per cent) and the kidney (25 per cent) on the basis of virus isolation when the birds were challenged with IS/885/00 (Meir and others 2004). Moreover, immunisation with live H120, H52 and D274 given singly was reported to produce little cross-protection from challenge with other nephropathogenic IBV strains (Albassam and others 1986, Lambrechts and others 1993, Pensaert and Lambrechts 1994).

A better protection observed in group II (d0:H120+CR88, d14:CR88) as compared with group I (d0:H120, d14:CR88), could be due to the higher levels of local and cellular immunity at the tracheal site which may have prevented the virulent virus from reaching the kidneys (Lambrechts and others 1993). In an another experiment, cellular and local immunity induced by administration of combined live Massachusetts and 793B-type vaccines at day-old showed a significant increase in the expression of CD4+, CD8+ and IgA-bearing B cells in the trachea compared with single H120 alone or unvaccinated groups (Awad and Ganapathy, unpublished).

This reflects that combined live IBV vaccination at day-old and revaccination at 14 days-old has provided an immunological boost compared with the other vaccination schedule (group 1). Although it has been demonstrated before that circulating humoral antibody levels are of minor importance in the protection from IBV infection (Raggi and Lee 1965, Darbyshire and Peters 1985, Endo-Munoz and Faragher 1989, Pensaert and Lambrechts 1994), in the present study the group with higher levels of humoral antibodies had better protection from both of the Middle East isolates.

Despite the 19\u201321 per cent variation in the S1 gene, the successful protection conferred by vaccination programmes employed in this study may be attributable to the shared characteristics of the S1 protein of the vaccine and the challenge IBVs (Cavanagh and others 1986).",
