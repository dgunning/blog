To test this hypothesis, we compared the ability of overlayed versus transfected c-di-GMP to induce type I IFN in bone marrow macrophages. At the concentrations used (up to 25 \u03bcg/ml), overlay of c-di-GMP did not elicit a significant response (Fig. 1 A), although IFN-\u03b2 production could be detected at higher concentrations (50 or 100 \u03bcg/ml; not depicted). In contrast, delivery of c-di-GMP to the cytosol by transfection elicited robust activation of IFN-\u03b2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 A). A significant response was detected with a concentration of c-di-GMP as low as 2.5 \u03bcg/ml (equivalent to 3.6 \u03bcM). These results suggested that c-di-GMP signals via a cytosolic immunosurveillance pathway.",

We measured induction of endogenous type I IFN protein by bioassay (Fig. 1 B), and induction of IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b15 mRNA levels by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 1, C and D). No detectable IFN-\u03b2 production was observed upon transfection with GTP, cGMP, ppGpp (a different bacterial nucleotide second messenger), or pGpG (hydrolyzed c-di-GMP), whereas the cytosolic response to 3.3 \u03bcg/ml of transfected c-di-GMP was of a similar magnitude to that of 3.3 \u03bcg/ml of transfected DNA (pdA:dT) and RNA (pI:C), which are known cytosolic inducers of type I IFN. We do not believe that the cytosolic induction of type I IFNs in response to c-di-GMP is caused by a contaminant (such as LPS) because (a) the c-di-GMP compound was chemically synthesized and >98% pure by HPLC (not depicted), (b) phosphodiesterase treatment of c-di-GMP resulted in a product that is no longer stimulatory (Fig. 1 E), and (c) macrophages deficient in all TLR signaling and unable to respond to LPS still responded to c-di-GMP (see below). Thus, these observations suggest that c-di-GMP is sensed in the cytosol, resulting in a potent induction of type I IFN in bone marrow macrophages.",

Whole transcriptome spotted MEEBO microarrays (Verdugo and Medrano, 2006) were used in these experiments. The results indicated that the transcriptional profile of cells stimulated by cytosolic c-di-GMP was very similar to the transcriptional profile of cells stimulated with cytosolic DNA. Induction of type I IFNs and known type I IFN-inducible genes dominated the transcriptional response, but other genes (e.g., Il6, Cd86, and Cxcl9) were also strongly induced (Fig. 1 F and Table S1). Although the transcriptional profiles of cells stimulated with c-di-GMP and DNA were highly similar, a small number of genes were reproducibly preferentially induced by c-di-GMP as compared with DNA (e.g., HtrA serine peptidase 4 and claudin 23; Table S1). Collectively, these results suggested that similar but not identical downstream signaling pathways are triggered by DNA and c-di-GMP.",

For example, HEK293 cells might lack an essential accessory protein. To rule out a role for TLRs in sensing of c-di-GMP, we tested responses in Myd88\u2212/\u2212Trif\u2212/\u2212double-knockout macrophages, which are deficient in all TLR signaling (Yamamoto et al., 2003). Both wild-type and Myd88\u2212/\u2212Trif\u2212/\u2212 macrophages showed a robust induction of IFN-\u03b2 after c-di-GMP stimulation (Fig. 2 A). As expected, the Myd88\u2212/\u2212Trif\u2212/\u2212 macrophages did not respond to LPS (Fig. 2 A). These results indicated that TLR signaling is not required for responsiveness to c-di-GMP, and are consistent with c-di-GMP signaling via a cytosolic surveillance pathway.",

            "text": "Robust transcription of the IFN-\u03b2 gene requires the coordinate activation of several transcription factors, including IRF3 and NF-\u03baB (Panne, 2008). We therefore expected that the c-di-GMP\u2013induced signaling pathway would also require these factors to induce type I IFN. IRF3 activation requires phosphorylation by the TBK1 kinase, which leads to IRF3 dimerization and nuclear translocation (Fitzgerald et al., 2003; Sharma et al., 2003; Hemmi et al., 2004; McWhirter et al., 2004; Perry et al., 2004). To address whether TBK1 is required for activation of type I IFN by c-di-GMP, we tested c-di-GMP responses in Tbk1\u2212/\u2212 macrophages (Fig. 2 B). We observed very little IFN-\u03b2 induction by c-di-GMP in cells lacking Tbk1, suggesting that TBK1 is required for c-di-GMP signaling. We also observed that Tbk1 is required for the induction of IFN-\u03b2 by pdA:dT (Fig. 2 B), in agreement with a recently published report (Miyahira et al., 2009). Although the data indicate a key role for Tbk1 in the response to c-di-GMP, it is formally possible, albeit unlikely, that Tbk1 protein rather than Tbk1 kinase activity is required for the response. We also tested the requirement for the TBK1-related kinase Ikbke (also called IKK\u03f5 or IKK-i), which plays a role in IFN-\u03b2\u2013mediated antiviral immunity (Tenoever et al., 2007), and found that Ikbke\u2212/\u2212 macrophages responded normally to c-di-GMP (Fig. 2 C).",

The partial requirement for Irf7 may reflect a role for Irf7 signaling as part of a positive feedback loop involving signaling through the type I IFN receptor (Ifnar). Indeed, Ifnar\u2212/\u2212 macrophages exhibited a diminished response to c-di-GMP (Fig. 2 E). Irf5 and Irf1 did not seem to be required for responsiveness to c-di-GMP (Fig. 2 F).

This was particularly important to establish in light of a previous report that exogenous (untransfected) c-di-GMP failed to activate NF-\u03baB (Karaolis et al., 2007a). There have also been inconsistent reports in the literature as to whether cytosolic DNA induces NF-\u03baB (Ishii et al., 2006; Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006a; Sun et al., 2006). We found that c-di-GMP treatment led to the activation of NF-\u03baB, as assessed by using an electromobility gel shift assay, with similar kinetics to that of transfected pI:C and pdA:dT (Fig. 3 B). The probe-bound complex was confirmed to contain NF-\u03baB p65 by supershifting with an anti-p65 antibody (Fig. 3 B). We confirmed these results by using a RAW macrophage cell line stably transfected with an NF-\u03baB luciferase reporter. We observed activation of the NF-\u03baB luciferase reporter by transfected c-di-GMP (Fig. 3 C). Both the gel shift and reporter assays showed that the activation of NF-\u03baB by transfected c-di-GMP was not as strong as observed with transfected pdA:dT and pI:C. The subtle difference in NF-\u03baB induction between cytosolic DNA and c-di-GMP may suggest that there are distinct signaling components upstream of NF-\u03baB in the two pathways. Nonetheless, we concluded that transfected c-di-GMP is capable of activating NF-\u03baB. The relatively low levels and late time course of NF-\u03baB induction by c-di-GMP (as compared with induction by LPS), as well as the fact that we transfected c-di-GMP into cells, may explain why NF-\u03baB induction was not previously observed in response to c-di-GMP (Karaolis et al., 2007a).",

B6 mice injected with c-di-GMP produced an IFN response to c-di-GMP, and this response was abolished in Irf3/7 double-deficient mice (Fig. 6 A). Interestingly, single-deficient Irf3\u2212/\u2212 mice responded to c-di-GMP in vivo (unpublished data), implying a role for IRF7 in responses to c-di-GMP in vivo. To determine whether cytokine induction by c-di-GMP affected cellular responses in vivo, we collected splenic NK cells from mice injected with c-di-GMP and measured their responsiveness to YAC-1 target cells ex vivo. Because NK cells respond to in vivo injection of poly I:C, a prototypical IFN inducer, we expected that c-di-GMP might also activate NK cells. Indeed, NK cells obtained from B6 mice injected with c-di-GMP responded to YAC-1 cells, as measured by intracellular cytokine staining for IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 6 B). However, NK cells obtained from Irf3/7\u2212/\u2212 mice stimulated with c-di-GMP were nonresponsive to YAC-1 target cells. As a negative control, NK cells stimulated ex vivo with PBS did not produce IFN-\u03b3. These observations indicate that c-di-GMP can stimulate cytokine and NK cell responses in vivo, and these responses require the IRF3/7 transcription factors.",

Serum was collected from immunized mice 2 wk after a single intraperitoneal injection. Mice immunized with HSA alone did not mount a significant antibody response to HSA. In contrast, mice injected with HSA plus c-di-GMP produced variable but significant titers of HSA-specific IgG1 antibodies, confirming that c-di-GMP can function as an adjuvant in vivo. Importantly, our preliminary data indicated that the adjuvant effect of c-di-GMP depended on IRF3/7, as antibody responses in Irf3/7\u2212/\u2212 mice immunized with HSA and c-di-GMP were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced as compared with immunized B6 mice (Fig. 6 C). Further studies will be required to establish the mechanism by which c-di-GMP functions as an adjuvant, but our results are consistent with a recent report indicating that the IRF3/7 kinase, TBK1, is required for adaptive immune responses in a DNA-vaccine model (Ishii et al., 2008).",

Nucleic acids appear to be a favored target of immune recognition, and are sensed by a variety of endosomal and cytosolic sensor proteins. The cyclic dinucleotide c-di-GMP is a bacterial second messenger that exhibits several characteristics that are desirable in an immunostimulatory ligand: it is produced by numerous species of bacteria, it is a critical regulator of bacterial physiology, and it is not similar to host molecules. Indeed, several previous reports have demonstrated that c-di-GMP can provoke potent immune responses when injected in vivo into mice (Karaolis et al., 2005a; Karaolis et al., 2005b; Karaolis et al., 2007a; Karaolis et al., 2007b). However, the mechanism by which c-di-GMP stimulates immune responses remained unclear. Our data provide evidence that c-di-GMP is sensed by a novel cytosolic immunosurveillance pathway. Responsiveness to c-di-GMP is independent of TLRs that monitor the extracellular/endosomal compartments and is strongly potentiated by transfection of c-di-GMP into the host cell cytosol. Moreover, c-di-GMP provokes a transcriptional response highly reminiscent of that triggered by the cytosolic presence of DNA or RNA, and involves activation of TBK-1, MAP kinases, and the IRF-3 and NF-\u03baB transcription factors. Thus, we propose that c-di-GMP is sensed in the cytosol.",

Known nucleic acid sensors include Mda5 and RIG-I, which sense viral RNA and signal via MAVS, as well as DAI, a putative sensor of DNA that signals independently of MAVS. Based on the finding that most cell types, including MEFs, can still respond to DNA in the absence of DAI (Ishii et al., 2008), it has been proposed that an additional DNA sensor must exist and that MEFs express both of these sensors (Wang et al., 2008). Our results now suggest that there is at least one additional nucleic acid sensor in the cytosol, because we find that MEFs do not respond well to c-di-GMP. Given the marked chemical dissimilarities among DNA, RNA, and c-di-GMP, it is perhaps not surprising that these nucleic acids appear to be recognized by different sensors. Indeed, we favor the idea that there are multiple cytosolic sensors for nucleic acids leading to induction of type I IFNs. The specificities of these various sensors will require further dissection. For example, although DAI knockout cells still responded to c-di-GMP, it remains formally possible that DAI is just one of several redundant sensors for c-di-GMP. These possibilities can be addressed once additional cytosolic nucleic acid sensors are identified.",

Other related small nucleic acid compounds such as GTP, cGMP, ppGpp, and pGpG did not trigger transcriptional induction of type I IFNs (Fig. 1). In addition, c-di-GMP that was hydrolyzed by snake venom phosphodiesterase did not induce type I IFN (Fig. 1). However, our results cannot eliminate the possibility that a metabolite of c-di-GMP, rather than c-di-GMP itself, is the true molecular moiety that is sensed in the cytosol. Elimination of this possibility awaits identification of the c-di-GMP sensor and biophysical or crystallographic characterization of its binding to c-di-GMP. Our results also cannot eliminate the possibility that c-di-GMP triggers type I IFN expression indirectly, for example, by stimulating the synthesis of a host ligand that functions as the \u201ctrue\u201d proximal trigger of type I IFN gene expression. It is also possible that c-di-GMP acts \u201cpharmacologically\u201d by disrupting host physiology in a way that results in type I IFN expression. Moreover, because the signaling triggered by c-di-GMP and cytosolic DNA are very similar, it is possible that the c-di-GMP pathway is a branch off of the DNA-sensing pathway rather than a fully independent pathway. However, even if these alternative models are correct, our data indicate that the pathway downstream of c-di-GMP contains at least some novel components and is at least partially independent of known cytosolic or TLR signaling pathways.",

The mechanism by which these pathogens induce type I IFN resembles that of c-di-GMP: in all cases, type I IFN induction is independent of MyD88/Trif and TLRs, requires TBK1 and IRF3, and (with one exception; unpublished data; Opitz et al., 2006) is independent of the cytosolic RNA-sensing pathway. It is widely assumed that bacterial DNA, perhaps released after bacterial cell lysis, is the relevant ligand that triggers type I IFNs in response to pathogens. There are no data that eliminate or confirm this possibility, as sensors required for IFN induction in response to cytosolic bacteria have not yet been reported. However, it is noteworthy that in all cases, induction of type I IFNs by cytosolic bacteria requires expression of an auxiliary secretion system, namely the ESX-1 system of M. tuberculosis, the Francisella pathogenicity island-encoded secretion system of F. tularensis, the Dot/Icm system of L. pneumophila, or the MdrM multidrug efflux pump of L. monocytogenes. It is tempting to speculate that a small, bacterially derived molecule such as c-di-GMP could be transported or leak through these secretion systems. It has not yet been possible to test this idea directly because all of these bacterial species encode numerous c-di-GMP synthases, and a strain lacking all c-di-GMP synthesis has not been reported. In any case, interpretation of these experiments would be complicated by the fact that c-di-GMP plays important regulatory roles in bacterial physiology and pathogenesis. Nevertheless, our results with synthetic purified c-di-GMP suggest that in addition to DNA, c-di-GMP is a candidate for a conserved molecule unique to bacteria that is responsible for triggering transcription of type I IFN genes. In light of a recent report that bacteria appear to be able to synthesize c-di-AMP (Witte et al., 2008), it is interesting to consider whether additional nucleic acids produced specifically by bacteria might also trigger host immunosurveillance pathways. Non\u2013nucleic acid small molecules, such as the drug DMXAA, also appear to be able to stimulate the TBK1\u2013IRF3 axis (Roberts et al., 2007). Indeed, there may be multiple redundant pathways for cytosolic sensing of bacteria. Collectively, the available evidence suggests that host cells may sense a wider array of bacterial ligands than was previously appreciated.",

DNA vaccines have attracted considerable enthusiasm as an approach for protecting against a variety of infectious diseases (Wang et al., 2001; Yang et al., 2004), but there are safety concerns about the insertional mutagenic potential of DNA vaccines and/or their potential to trigger pathogenic anti-DNA autoimmune antibody responses (Schalk et al., 2006). The potency of DNA vaccines appears to derive from their ability to stimulate the TBK1 and innate cytosolic DNA-sensing pathways (Ishii et al., 2006). Thus, our demonstration that a synthetic nonself non-DNA molecule such as c-di-GMP can stimulate an in vitro and in vivo innate and adaptive immune response (Fig. 6) similar to that induced by DNA, without similar autoimmune or mutagenic risks, suggests that c-di-GMP might have valuable application as a small-molecule adjuvant.
