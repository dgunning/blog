Taxonomically, TBEV is a species within the mammalian tick-borne flaviviruses (mTBFV). Together with the seabird tick-borne flavivirus group (sTBFV), they comprise one ecological group of tick-borne flaviviruses (TBFV) within the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae. Two other ecological groups within the genus Flavivirus are the mosquito-borne flaviviruses (MBFV) and flaviviruses with no-known vector (NKV) (4). A fourth group including Kamiti River virus (KRV) (5), cell fusion agent virus (CFAV) (6) and Culex flavivirus (CuFV) (7) have been isolated only from mosquitoes with no demonstrated capacity to replicate in mammals and are under consideration by the ICTV Committee for classification as \u2018probably arthropod-borne viruses\u2019 (PABV).",

In evolutionary terms, the 3\u2032-UTR of the TBFV group is formed by four conserved long imperfectly repeated sequences (LSRs), genetic remnants of which are revealed in the MBFV, NKV and PABV groups (17). It has been proposed that the 5\u2032-UTR may have evolved from a trans-terminal duplication of the archival flavivirus 3\u2032-UTR (16).",

Engineered deletions or modifications of the REEs enable the recovery of viable viruses that are attenuated as a result of reduced RNA synthesis (10, 19\u201322). The cumulative effect of several REEs enhances the assembly of the RdRp complex and is probably critical to the survival of flaviviruses in nature (23). The REEs identified for MBFV have become an important target for the development of a live attenuated vaccine for dengue virus (24, 25).",

Indeed, RNA secondary structures have been predicted within the coding region of several flaviviruses (26\u201328). Here, using bioinformatic and reverse genetic analysis we demonstrate that the capsid-encoding region of TBEV contains an REE which we designate SL6 (26, 27). Phylogenetic evidence suggests that the MBFV group also contains at least a partial SL6-like structure, though it is absent in the NKV or PABV groups. The significance of these findings in the context of flavivirus evolution and adaptation to transmission is discussed.",

Similarly, pGGVs660\u201310927 was digested with NotI, dephosphorylated and then digested with AgeI. The excised linker DNA fragments from pGGVs660 and pGGVs660\u201310927 were removed using MicroSpinTM S-400 columns (Pharmacia Biotech) and ligated at the AgeI site generating full-length cDNA which was linearized with SmaI and used as a template for SP6 transcription (34). In vitro-synthesized RNA was inoculated intracerebrally into suckling mice to recover the mutant viruses which were not passaged further prior to phenotype evaluation (35). Recovered viruses were amplified by RT\u2013PCR between nucleotides 1\u2013940 (5\u2032-UTR-C-prM region of the TBEV genome) and 10206\u201310927 (3\u2032-UTR), and sequenced to validate the presence of the introduced mutations and to exclude extraneous mutations at the 5\u2032-UTR and 3\u2032-UTR (36).",

This analysis was extended to investigate the conservation of SL6 in the larger group of distantly related mTBFV, sTBFV and KADV (37). A nucleotide alignment of the C region was generated and optimized by the introduction of numerous gaps (Supplementary Figure S1A); it shows that divergent RFV, GGYV and KSIV (distant virus species of the mTBFV) maintained homology in the SL6 region. However, some nucleotide perturbations in the SL6 region were observed between mTBFV, sTBFV (MEAV, TYUV and SREV) and KADV proving that the region between the initiation codon and SL6 had evolved with frame shifts as we previously demonstrated (16).

Both ALIDOT-predicted DV2 and DV4 (28) fall immediately either side of the region of maximum SSSV suggesting that they are less conserved than DV3 (Supplementary Figure S1A). STRUCTURE_DIST also predicts the formation of the DV2 and DV3 but not the SL6-like structure (Supplementary Figure S1A and Figure 2). However, a truncated SL6-like structure was predicted to form in all DENV serotypes, albeit at a suboptimal energy level, when the SL6-like region was folded independently from neighboring regions that form more stable overlapping structures (Supplementary Figure S1A). Taken together, these data indicate that the DENV SL6-like structure was the least stable conformation among the MBFVs, potentially preventing its prediction by statistical approaches used here and elsewhere (28). Despite this, the short-stem region of putative DENV SL6-like structures is highly conserved within the DENV group (DENV serotypes 1\u20134) and also between DENV and JEV (Supplementary Figure S1A) suggesting that a linear or conformational signal at this location might have some functionality.",

However, a silent substitution A234\u2192G that also enlarged the apical loop of mutant C11 (Figure 4) caused similar biological effects; it did not affect virus plaque size or level of cpe, but reduced virus replication rate early after infection (Figure 5 and Table 1).",

However, contradicting these findings a deletion within the C-coding region, which included SL6, did not prevent recovery of viable, albeit attenuated, TBEV (42). In this study, we employed a variety of complementary phylogenetic and thermodynamic methods to examine the evolutionary conservation of SL6 using a much larger sample of significantly divergent TBFVs, including new members of the mTBFV, sTBFV and Kadam subgroups (37). The viruses in the other ecological groups, namely MBFV, NKV and PABV were also included in this analysis to trace the evolution of SL6 throughout the entire genus Flavivirus. In addition, we used a reverse genetic system (34,36) to engineer TBEV strains with mutated SL6 to reveal the biological significance of this structure.",

In similar manner, an SL6-like structure has been predicted for MBFV although with less stability in comparison to SL6 in TBFV. Two other flavivirus groups NKV and PABV demonstrated no significant sequence homology with the TBFV SL6 region although the genome of KRV (PABV group) formed a thermodynamically stable structure in close vicinity to the TBFV SL6 with a similar terminal loop motif CCAA (TBFV\u2014UGCCAA) (Supplementary Figure S1).",

Substitutions within the conserved hexanucleotide loop down-regulated virus growth kinetics whereas changes in the terminal loop outside the hexanucleotide sequence did not alter the observed phenotype. The most significant changes of virus phenotype resulted from substitutions that distorted the stem of SL6; mutations that influenced the length or stability of the stem resulted in the recovery of viruses that formed small and/or turbid plaques. Increasing or decreasing the size of the apical loop had a minor biological effect on virus replication although this could also be interpreted as an effect of the altered stem length. However, the changes in replication kinetics from all modifications of SL6 were moderate and manifested themselves predominantly during the early stage of the virus replication cycle (Table 1).",

Enhancers were identified as RNA structures that individually produce only small biological effects on virus replication. However, the significance of enhancers as targets for the attenuation of flaviviruses to engineer live vaccines is evident from the example of dengue virus (24,25). Moreover, sequence and structural conservation of flavivirus enhancers is consistent with a role as key players in virus survival in the natural environment. We previously proposed that the cumulative action of several enhancer elements could contribute significantly to the overall rate of assembly of polymerase complexes, thereby enhancing virus survival across a range of natural hosts (17,18,23,27,43,44). In this respect, the presented experimental data indicate that SL6 belongs to the category of REEs, i.e. RNA structures that accelerate the replication of viruses (45\u201356). This eliminates the apparent contradictions between extremely high levels of SL6 conservation across divergent TBFV virus species and the redundancy of this element for the replication of laboratory-maintained TBEV strains (45\u201356). However, the specific mechanism by which SL6 functions to enhance virus replication remains to be elucidated.",

The SL6-like structure of MBFV is localized immediately downstream of the 5\u2032-CYCL (i.e. within the capsid gene, Supplementary Figure S1A) suggesting it could also contribute to genome circularization. It is possible that in accord with the 3\u2032 sHP (highly conserved throughout the genus Flavivirus), it contributes to the unpairing of the 5\u2032\u20133\u2032-CYCL panhandle, to promote RNA elongation on the linear template. In contrast, the 5\u2032-CYCL of TBFV is mapped to the 5\u2032-UTR (i.e. upstream of the capsid gene, Figure 1A) and therefore other tentative functions of the TBFV SL6 are not excluded, such as enhancing virus translation, RNA replication or playing a role in regulation between these processes; the possibility of a kissing-loop enhancer of genome circularization was previously discussed (17,18,23,27,43,44).",
