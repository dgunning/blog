This interest has been motivated by their unique function\u2014to replicate all forms of life, and confounded by their sequence diversity. As more tertiary structures of polymerase were solved, it became apparent that widely diverse sequences form highly similar structures. There has not, until recently, been a time-effective computational method to make detailed comparisons of these observations. The objective of this study was to clarify the relationship between structure and sequence in a group of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) that replicate many of the viruses that represent significant threats to life throughout the world. We selected well-studied species in order to maximize the amount of experimental data that could be used to evaluate the association of functional residues and structure (Table 1). We used the StralSV algorithm (1) to perform structure comparisons between all of the selected species. We created maps of residue-to-residue (R2R) correspondence from which we determined the boundaries of structurally similar segments\u2014which we named \u2018homomorphs\u2019. In contrast to the relatively short lengths of previously described motifs, we found that most homomorphs are long, and each provides a structural connection between the template tunnel or NTP entry tunnel and the exterior of the protein.\n",

It resembles that of a right-handed palm, with finger-like folds curved inward to form a tunnel that encircles the template that is being processed (3). Most single-unit polymerases are 400\u2013800 residues in length. Early polymerase studies found that \u223c22 residues are highly conserved in all polymerases, and in most species they are in the same sequential order (4). Some are clustered, with two to four highly conserved residues within a segment \u223c10 residues in length. The sequence segment that includes each of the highly conserved residues or clusters has been described as a motif. The motifs are arranged in most species in the order: G-F1-F2-F3-A-B-C-D-E. The birnaviruses (IBDV and IPNV) differ from this scheme due to a transversion involving the C Motif (C-A-B) (5). The references for each of the motifs and species that have been studied are listed in Table 2; these references were selected because they included either alignments of one or more motifs with several species, or alignments for a particular motif not found elsewhere. Apart from these conserved motifs, the RdRp sequences are highly variable. An extensive study of picornaviruses by Koonin et al.(6) illustrates this variability. The basis of Koonin et al.\u2019s study was an alignment of 64 species using the algorithm multiple sequence comparison by log expectation (MUSCLE) (7) and a manual adjustment. The alignment included four species that are also in our sample group, and these had a total of 32 conserved residues within sequences \u223c550 residues in length.\n",

We used the StralSV algorithm (http://proteinmodel.org/), described in detail previously (1), to perform the analyses. StralSV compares the R2R (structural) correspondence of each sequence in a set of reference sequences to a specified query sequence, beginning at the start of the sequence and continuing to the end, by evaluating successive overlapping segments of a user-selected length. Each of the selected structures was used as a query to all structures available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB release 2011_01_25; number of chains 176 365) (8). The results were filtered for structural segments of at least 55% LGA_S structure similarity (1) to at least one query segment of 90 amino acids in length (size cutoff for the structural context) from which R2R correspondences were extracted from local tightly superimposed spans: continuous segments of the minimum length of five amino acids. These parameters together contributed to the identification of common regions of structure similarity, which were used to distinguish regions of conservation (structure matches) from regions in which structure deviates (non-matches). The StralSV comparison of each initial query to all structures in PDB resulted in the identification of a final set of 37 PDB structures that were used as a reference polymerase structure set in this study. One representative of each species within the set of 37 PDB structures was used to create an all-against-all structure comparison using StralSV. The species and PDB identities of this reference set are summarized in Table 1.",

We named each of these regions a \u2018homomorph\u2019, defined as a sequence segment that shares a highly similar tertiary structure with other species, independent of the sequence composition. We found that most of the homomorphs were at least twice as long as the corresponding sequence motif. The extent of this expansion is illustrated in Figure 1. The length of each homomorph was determined separately for each species, using a single structure for each species as the query in a StralSV analysis. The identity of the start and end of each homomorph depends on the structural similarity to a given query. Therefore, there is some minor query-specific variability of the location of the ends of homomorphs that can be observed in Figure 1. Within the homomorphs, non-matching residues can be used to identify minor differences between species. In most single-stranded RdRp (ss-RdRp) species (PV, COXS, HRV, FMDV, NV, RHDV, SAPV, HCV, BVDV, WN and DENV), the homomorphs of Motif G are the largest (median of 53 residues), followed by A (49), B (46), E (37), F3 (28), D (23), C (17), F1 (10) and F2 (8).

The difference in linear order that results from the sequence inversion is compensated by a modified structure that maintains the motifs within a tertiary position that is similar to all other RdRps (Figure 7B and C).\n",

Various query sequences were tested with the expectation that they would capture additional alignments. The middle section of Figure 8A illustrates that this produced some improvement. For example, using an HCV query, there are R2R matches to TERT, TAQ and T7 DNAP. The C-terminal edge of the motif has some R2R correspondence, suggesting that the structure of the motif is moderately conserved. Using T7 DNAP as a query (lowest segment of the figure), only a small portion of the C-terminal edge of Motif D and a few species have similar structures.

HmF is an extensive structure with surface exposure at both ends and near its mid-section at Motif F2 (Figure 3A\u2013D). Motif F2 (Figure 3E) is analogous to the loop in hmG that varies in composition and length; it is upstream of a highly conserved motif and is species-specific. The large size of this homomorph and its positioning that transects the protein while maintaining contact with the template tunnel is consistent with its established role in transcription, which requires both fine-scale stability and large-scale mobility. Motif F3 consists of mostly basic amino acid residues and forms the roof of the NTP entry tunnel (41); the characteristic conserved arg residue is essential to nucleotide binding (38). The required orientation of the F motifs would be stabilized by the loop formed by hmF and the double-stranded segment formed by the extension of the homomorph beyond the motifs. Both the N-terminal and C-terminal residues of the homomorph are exposed at the exterior surface of the protein. In PV, mutations of residues adjacent to the N-terminal are lethal: G149-i-I150 (42) and H149A/K150A (37).",

The role of Motif B in the mechanisms of active site closure has recently been described in detail by Gong and Peersen (9).

It is folded in a manner that places the apex of the fold at the wall of the template tunnel, and both the N-terminus and C-terminus at the exterior surface of the protein (Figure 6B and C). Therefore, Motif C as defined in the literature comprises the homomorph. The absence of R2R correspondence adjacent to hmC indicates that the structures of the adjacent sequence segments are highly specific to each species. HmC is highly conserved in the RdRps and highly similar to the DNA-dependent polymerases. Although there is a sequence inversion in the birnaviruses (Motif C precedes Motif A), Figure 7B and C illustrates that despite the difference in sequence order, the homomorphs occupy a similar tertiary position. StralSV analysis indicates that the structure of Motif C is highly conserved in the RNA-dependent polymerases, though slightly different in the DNA-dependent polymerases (Figure 6A).",

Experimental studies have demonstrated that several residues within Motif C are sensitive to the position and composition of mutants. The highly conserved residues, GDD, occur near the center of the motif. The primary function of these residues is to coordinate the metal ions associated with the incoming rNTP(45,43). In PV, mutation of D to E in either or both positions (D328 or D329) is lethal (50). In HCV, mutation of G317A is also lethal (51). However, in birnaviruses the highly conserved residues are ADN, rather than GDD, and mutation to GDD increases RNA synthesis activity (5). Certain mutations immediately upstream from the GDD motif are lethal in PV: Y326[CHIMS] (50). This is similar to the effect of the L241-i-S242 at the downstream edge of Motif A in PV. Near the N-terminal end of Motif C in HCV (HCV T312), the mutation D311A characterizes chronic hepatitis (52). Mutation at the edge of a highly conserved structure seems to have a substantial effect on the viral life cycle. The R2R comparisons summarized in these structure maps identify the types of sequence variability that can occur while maintaining the same spatial structure (Figure 6A) and demonstrates and identifies the variations in composition that can be tolerated even within a key functional motif. The R2R correspondence of other RdRps with birnaviruses in Motif C (Figure 7A), despite the sequence inversion in birnaviruses (CAB) supports the premise that conservation of structure is a significant, if not dominant, factor in evolution.",

The most highly conserved residue within the homomorph is a gly (PV G351) at the N-terminal edge of the motif and central to the homomorph; gly in this position would facilitate the folding of the homomorph, and is consistent with Cameron et al.\u2019s (40) hypothesis that Motif D may be the most dynamic structural element of RdRps and RTs. Another conserved residue is a lys near the C-terminal edge (PV-K359).

The species-specific loop within hmE is at the outermost edge of the protein, a feature found in other homomorphs (G, F2 and A; Figures 2A, 3A and 4A, respectively). Huang et al. (25) found that the Motif E loop region acts as a pivot point for thumb subdomain movement upon template\u2013primer binding. Motif E may also function in the proper positioning of the thumb relative to the palm (5). The turn of the loop projects into the active site cavity where it has been implicated in helping to position the C-terminal end of the primer strand for attachment to the \u03b1-phosphate of the NTP during phosphoryl transfer (56). Motif E in HCV plays a role in binding the priming nucleotide (not the incoming nucleotides) (38); HCV has a longer loop (Figure 9A), possibly related to this function. In PV, the C-terminal of hmE (R402) emerges from the protein into the segment 28-SAFHYVFEG-36. This segment contains residues F30 and F34, which interact with W403 to maintain the polymerase structure (39).",

We have demonstrated that the RNA polymerases have structural skeletons (frames) that are highly conserved, with flexible segments between them, and that extensive segments of structure similarity can be identified by the methods we have described. These methods are applicable to the studies of other groups of proteins, and we anticipate that by accessing structure similarity independent of sequence composition, skeletal frameworks will be found in other groups of proteins.

It would be interesting to explore the possibility that interactions at the surface of the protein (e.g. protein\u2013protein contact at surface homomorph residues) may subtly affect function buried deep beneath, within the tunnel. Furthermore, each homomorph is either divided by or is separated from another homomorph by a flexible secondary structure. Identification of the span of each homomorph and the terminal residue enables us to identify specific residues on the surface that would not, in many cases, be otherwise noticed. By comparing experimental data with the surface location of the ends of the homomorphs, we have found that these are often the sites of key functional interactions of the protein.

Most mutations within the motifs are function-specific, related to either a change in charge or size, and in most cases the mutations are lethal [mA (42), mB (42), mC (50),(51)]. Mutations outside of the motif (but within the homomorph) are more often rate related and located in a segment that bulges from the homomorph by an amount that varies by species (Figures 2A, 3A and 4A). These differences support the hypothesis that residues actively involved in template processing are essential to viability, and most of them are components of a consistent, stable structure that places and/or maintains them in their appropriate functional position. However, the practice of mutating residues to ala has resulted in a somewhat \u2018all or nothing\u2019 perspective of mutations. StralSV analysis can facilitate informed selection of alternative residues of various compositions, which could possibly affect replication rates to different extents.

Its universality in the polymerase family suggests a functional significance. Residues within the homomorphs that were localized to the surface often had species-specific loops. The most likely reason these features have not been identified previously is due to the limitations of existing sequence and structure comparison tools\u2014in particular, the ability to perform multi-species comparisons of structures, using overlapping windows of a size determined by the user, and the ability to select the criteria for R2R matches. The homomorphs as defined in this work add structural clarity and context to sequence-based functional motifs previously observed by numerous authors performing comparative studies among polymerases. The structure maps created from the R2R correspondences identified by the StralSV algorithm provided a unique and informative perspective of structure and function in RdRps. They readily identify unique regions of each species and those shared by proteins within a family. These are features that would be useful for studies of any protein family. Based on the results of this study, it may be possible to define characteristic homomorphs for many other protein families, despite considerable sequence variation. It may be feasible to classify homomorphs in a manner analogous to the SCOP database, and in doing so provide new insight into protein evolution.",

In cells with a light blue background filled with a number, the number is the sequence position of the adjacent matches for each species; numbers in the white column between them summarize the length of sequence that the non-matched sequence represents in each species. In this segment there are more residues in each species than between the corresponding residues in PV, indicating that this region is a loop that is absent in PV, and the loop length varies by species. At the left of the alignment (209\u2013214, uncolored), there is a structure common to several species, but too few to qualify the region as part of the homomorph. (B) In this figure of poliovirus (PDB:1RA6), the N-terminal segment of the homomorph is blue and the C-terminal segment is brown. The terminal residues of HmA are at the exterior surface of the protein (PDB:1RA6). Motif A is centered within the homomorph at the wall of the template tunnel. (C) The terminal residues of the homomorph and the helix adjacent to each are constituents of the protein surface. (D) In PV, an insertion (red) at the C-terminal edge of the motif is lethal: L241-i-S242 (42). A species-specific loop (green) affects the catalytic rate (in PV) (37).",

The species TAQ-N4-T7 DNAP-T7 RNAP align with each other over about 20 residues, but do not align structurally with the other species. (B) HmB [illustrated using poliovirus (PDB:1RA6)] is the largest homomorph in the RdRps. The N-terminal segment of HmB (blue) begins at the exterior surface of the protein, folds back on itself to form a classical \u03b2-hairpin (at the apex, PV 275-YKN-278), and then continues to Motif B (gold), which is located at the surface of the template tunnel. The C-terminal segment of the homomorph (brown) continues as a single chain to the exterior surface of the protein. (C) The N-terminal segment of hmB is at the surface of the protein.

Motif C [illustrated using poliovirus (PDB:1RA6)] is tightly folded upon itself in a manner that places the highly conserved residues (yellow) at the tunnel wall, whereas the N-terminal segment of the motif (blue) and C-terminal segment of the motif (brown) are parallel to each other and penetrate the protein.
