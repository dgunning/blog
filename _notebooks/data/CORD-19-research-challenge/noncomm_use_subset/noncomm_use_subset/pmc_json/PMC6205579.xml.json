Recently many global alarms involving HIDs occurred, such as the huge Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza A and the emergence of new coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Some cases of imported or autochthonous viral haemorrhagic fever occurred in Europe, highlighting the need to improve preparedness for these diseases [5]. In particular, these diseases cannot be cared for in regular healthcare settings because their epidemic potential may pose a risk to healthcare workers (HCWs) and other patients. Patients with suspected or proven HIDs should be cared for in a high-level isolation unit (HLIU), a facility providing safe, secure, high-quality and appropriate care with optimal infection containment, prevention and control procedures. The need for these isolation facilities was confirmed during the Ebola outbreak of 2013\u20132015, during which many patients were treated in highly specialized centres in Western countries, with no case of secondary transmission. In contrast, when patients with Ebola were hospitalized in non\u2013specially equipped hospitals, cases of transmission to HCWs occurred, mainly in African countries but also in Western countries [6].",

The president of the European parliament, Martin Schulz, said in 2014 that Europe's migration policy \u2018turned the Mediterranean into a graveyard.\u2019 Despite many alarms on this regard, given that the travelling time for migration is much longer than the incubation time of HID, it is improbable that an HID could be introduced in Europe by migrants.",

We also admit patients with multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, as well as suspected cases of SARS or MERS coronavirus and Ebola haemorrhagic fever, as well as any patient who is a victim of a yet undiscovered but highly contagious emerging infectious agent. The third floor of L'Institut Hospitalo Universitaire M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Infection building is dedicated to BSL-3 activities with 1450 m2 for BSL-3 laboratories including a BSL-3 necropsy room and a 1300 m2 BSL-3 healthcare ward, including a BSL-3 point-of-care laboratory [9]. The latter is dedicated to the care of contagious patients and has been built according to the most recent recommendations [3], [4], [10]. During routine care, except in times of sanitary crisis, 25 single bedrooms can be used individually with negative pressure (\u221250 Pa) or positive pressure (+20 Pa) to treat patients with diseases such as Beijing genotype or multidrug-resistant tuberculosis as well as immunocompromised patients with febrile neutropenia, but also to optimize the care for Clostridium difficile colitis or emerging multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. In times of sanitary crisis, the ward can be used as a modularly BSL-3 HLIU (8 + 7 + 10 beds) for patients with highly pathogenic microorganisms; facilities include secure anteroom access, a dedicated nurse room, autoclave and point-of-care laboratory. Each room is equipped as stated above and has video surveillance. The whole building is equipped with Wi-Fi, thus allowing communication for long-term isolated patients.
