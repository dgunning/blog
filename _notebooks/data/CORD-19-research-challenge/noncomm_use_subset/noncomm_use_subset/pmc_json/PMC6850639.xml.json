Perhaps the greatest excitement surrounds the potential application of bacteriophage\u2010based therapy in animal agriculture, as is currently available for food safety and processing applications. Bacteriophages (or phages) are viruses that specifically infect bacteria; they can rapidly and efficiently kill their bacterial targets while simultaneously growing in numbers. This therapy would have numerous advantages over antibiotics; in particular, it would be safe for humans and the environment, and any resistance that emerges might be easier to manage than AMR from antibiotic use. However, phage research is largely confined to academic settings, as many biotechnology companies may be wary of getting involved because of potential uncertainties about profitability and how to deploy them most effectively.

Indeed, as the proportion of broiler chickens raised without antibiotics (RWA) in the United States has grown from less than 10% in 2014 to nearly 50% in 2018, there has been a rise in the number of cases of enteric and respiratory diseases on poultry farms, including coccidiosis, clostridial enteritis, colibacillosis, and Staphylococcus\u2010associated osteoarthritis and osteomyelitis.3 On swine farms, the greatest threats to animal health are respiratory diseases, particularly influenza, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae; secondary bacterial infections associated with these diseases are also the most common reason for antibiotic use.4 Similarly, the bovine respiratory disease (BRD) complex includes a variety of bacterial pathogens, notably Mannheimia haemolytica, which results in important economic losses for the cattle industry.5 For milk producers, bovine mastitis is the costliest disease and the cause of most antibiotic use.6\n",

For example, in the United States, 90\u201395% of broiler and breeder farmers of poultry and 48% of pigs are contracted by large integrators such as Tyson Foods and Smithfield, respectively.9\n",

In the case of poultry, the primary breeder companies supply different strains of birds that have qualities considered important to the finished product of the integrated broiler complex. At this stage of production, the goal is to raise the immature breeding stock according to production standards and for the animals to remain free of infectious diseases.10 Disease control is accomplished through multiple measures including vaccination programs, disease surveillance, sanitation, waste removal, and biosecurity in order to restrict the introduction and spread of pathogens onto and within farms.11 When the immature breeders reach sexual maturity, they are moved to breeder farms where they produce fertile hatching eggs. The same management practices are used on breeder farms to mitigate disease occurrence. Additionally, key to limiting the amount of bacterial contamination that is passed from the breeder farm to the hatchery and, ultimately, to the broiler farm is ensuring that hatching eggs are properly handled and stored to limit bacterial contamination and subsequent bacterial bloom that can occur after hatching eggs are transferred to the hatchery for incubation and hatch. Hatcheries take similar measures to reduce disease challenge, including sanitation, vaccination of broiler chicks, and pest management. Shortly after hatching, the broiler chicks are transported to grow\u2010out farms where they are raised to the target weight and subsequently taken to processing plants.10\n",

For example, pig farms in Minnesota and Iowa have increased their biosecurity measures by investing heavily in air filtration systems. Though lacking a vertically integrated system, the pig industry is attempting to ensure the health of animals by intensifying efforts to source all the pigs in a grow\u2010out facility from the same breeder employing high\u2010level biosecurity measures.

If more effective vaccines were developed against viral diseases, such as infectious bronchitis and infectious bursal disease, and against bacterial infections secondary to coccidiosis infection, such as clostridia, this would significantly reduce antibiotic use in chickens, according to a 2015 report by a working group convened by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE).17\n",

            "text": "Despite the interest in phage\u2010based therapeutics, the research field has been limited by several challenges. The current approach taken by most researchers is to isolate a collection of phages from the environment and test them for activity against a pathogen of interest. It is rare for the same phage to be evaluated more than once between studies, which makes it difficult to generalize research findings and develop the phages into a viable product. In many studies, phages were selected for use based on their ability to infect a particular pathogenic strain of interest, but beyond this basic characteristic, it is not clear how to predict which phages and treatment regimens would be the best candidates for commercial development. Most published applied phage research has been conducted in academic settings without input from biotech companies, and thus the research may not focus on bacterial targets that companies are interested in pursuing because the market is too small to offset the high cost of development. Finally, the intellectual property landscape for phage products is also unlike that of most traditional antimicrobials, as phages themselves are products of nature, and the practice of using phages as antibacterials dates back to the 1920s, resulting in a significant amount of prior art\na\n that may interfere with patent protection.37\n",

There are also many unknowns concerning the interaction of phages with a given host's immune system and the pharmacokinetics of phages.38 Future research is needed in these areas to help inform the development and design of phage\u2010based therapy. As more phages are isolated from the environment and characterized, and as phage libraries are expanded, the research field may increasingly move toward engineering phages by starting with a so\u2010called \u201cplatform\u201d phage and genetically modifying it to have certain properties.39 There are early indications that the FDA would not evaluate such genetically modified phages differently from other, naturally occurring phages.",

            "text": "Another important issue in phage research is determining the diseases that represent the most feasible targets for phage\u2010based therapy. Phages generally have a very narrow range of activity against a single bacterial species, more typically against a subset of strains within a species, which means careful planning must occur in the development of a phage product if it is to have activity against most or all strains of a pathogenic species. An alternative would essentially be precision medicine for animal agriculture, that is, adopt similar approaches to how phages are being studied, and increasingly used experimentally, in human medicine.40, 41 A precision medicine model would, however, be a significant departure from how antimicrobials are currently used in food\u2010animal industry. In either case, the specificity of a given phage influences the choice of target for phage applications. For example, infections that are caused by genetically homogeneous pathogens such as L. monocytogenes, or a single bacterial serotype such as E. coli O157:H7, are more attractive phage\u2010therapy candidates, whereas a disease such as BRD would be more challenging to treat using phages because BRD can be caused by multiple bacterial pathogens. Currently, as mentioned above phages are most commonly used in food safety for controlling Listeria and E. coli O157:H7. On the other hand, the specific antibacterial activity of phages has certain advantages, including not killing beneficial bacteria and resistance development that would only arise in the target bacteria, thus avoiding cross\u2010resistance.",

            "text": "Bacteria develop resistance to phages at fairly high rates of about 1 in 106 to 1 in 108 bacterial cells, depending on the phage (similar to the rates bacteria can develop resistance to certain antibiotics, such as streptomycin). A common mechanism of resistance is the loss of the bacterial surface feature (receptor) that the phage uses to recognize and adsorb to the cell.42 However, this can be circumvented by developing a cocktail of phages that use different receptors, as spontaneous mutation and loss of multiple receptors is comparatively less probable, and, in addition, bacteria may become less fit as they lose surface features.33 In addition, bacteria can carry antiphage defense mechanisms, such as restriction\u2010modification\u2013, toxin\u2010antitoxin\u2013, and CRISPR\u2010Cas\u2013based systems.33, 42 However, phages can still be active against bacteria with such defense systems because in many cases the initial phage infection event is fatal to the bacterial cell, even if the phages are unable to replicate and lyse their host. As such, it is important to consider resistance in the context of phage\u2010based agents as the inability of a phage to kill its target strain, rather than the traditional definition of lack of plaque formation,43 This definition is relevant in phage applications, where replication of the phage is not required to effect significant bacterial reductions because the number of phages is greater than that of the target bacterial cells to such a degree that essentially all of the accessible cells are infected shortly after application. Such a situation might occur in the treatment of surface bacterial contamination (e.g., hides, foods, or equipment) with a phage preparation sufficient to infect every bacterial cell, and where the treatment site is fully exposed and contact time is limited. Calculations used in phage biocontrol on foods44 may become relevant for such applications as well.",

In this context, engineered phages deliver CRISPR\u2010Cas systems into bacteria to destroy antibiotic resistance genes, rather than killing the bacteria outright. Another interesting phage\u2010based avenue for control of pathogens, such as Staphylococcus in mastitis, is the use of phage\u2010encoded lysins such as endolysins. Endolysins are the enzymes phages produce in order to destroy the bacterial cell wall, allowing progeny phage to escape from the infected cell. In Gram\u2010positive bacteria, these enzymes also work from outside the cell, and research has shown that the enzymes may be promising as an intervention in diseases such as mastitis.45\n",

Indeed, even Denmark and Holland, which have surpassed other countries in reducing antibiotic use in animal agriculture, still rely on antibiotics in these settings.
