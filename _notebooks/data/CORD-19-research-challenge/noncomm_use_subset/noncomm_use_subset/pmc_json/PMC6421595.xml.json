However, determining when a positive urine culture represents at urinary tract infection (UTI) as opposed to urinary tract colonization (UTC) can be difficult.1 Indeed, as more than half of urine cultures from children with neurogenic bladders are positive in the absence of symptoms,2 a positive urine culture is not diagnostic of a UTI in these children. Furthermore, there is no widely accepted definition of UTI in children with neurogenic bladders,3 which contributes to the significant variability in the way that clinicians both diagnose and treat suspected UTIs in this population.3-5 As there is no defintion of UTI in these children, clinicians rely on their assessment of symptoms to diagnose a UTI. However, while the combination of some symptoms is generally considered diagnostic of a UTI, such as fever, abdominal pain, and vomiting in the absence of another source, other symptoms, such as increased incontinence or discomfort with catheterization, are less clear. Indeed, in a series of adults with neurogenic bladder, symptoms were found to be non-specific for UTI.6",

While specific urinalysis (UA) parameters have good sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of UTI in the general pediatrics population,7,8 UA results are less useful in diagnosing UTIs in patients with neurogenic bladders.9 This is likely related to the fact that components of the UA are either markers of inflammation (ie, pyuria, leukocyte esterase) or indicative of the presence of an organism (eg, nitrites) and are not specific for UTI in this population. A more accurate and objective method to diagnose UTIs in this population is needed. Indeed, there is a rapidly rising trend in antibiotic-resistant organisms cultured from urine in children with neurogenic bladders.10 Although this is multifactorial, one reason behind trend is the large number of antibiotics that these children receive. Identification of a biomarker that is both sensitive and specific for UTIs in this urologically complex patient population would improve the ability to appropriately prescribe antibiotics.",

This included patients presenting for urodynamics, who have routine urine cultures sent at our institution, and those presenting for evaluation of potential UTI. Patients who met inclusion criteria (ie, presence of a neurogenic bladder, actively performing CIC) were initially identified in the electronic health record (EPIC\u2122, Verona, WI) using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision codes for neurogenic bladder or spina bifida. Following initial identification, the research team then performed a manual review of each patient\u2019s medical record to confirm that inclusion criteria were met. All eligible patients were then flagged in VigiLanz\u2122 (VigiLanz Corporation, Minneapolis, MN), a real-time lab monitoring software that sent an automatic notification via e-mail to the research team when a flagged patient had a urine sample sent to the clinical laboratory. The residual urine was then obtained for use in this work. Patients were excluded for the following reasons: if they met the KDIGO criteria for acute kidney injury,12 had signs or symptoms of sepsis13 at the time of presentation, or if they were dialysis-dependent. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board.",

Sample volumes were reduced with a 3-kDa filter into 1\u00d7 Laemmli buffer. The protein concentrations were measured using the Pierce 660 nm Protein Assay kit (Thermo Scientific) as this assay is both compatible with higher concentrations of detergents and maintains a greater linear range than standard Coomassie dye-binding assays (eg, Bradford assay). The samples were then run in a 1D, 1.5 cm 4% to 12% Bis-Tris gel using MOPS (3-(morpholino)propanesulfonic acid) running buffer. The regions of each lane between the well and the dye front were excised for trypsin digestion. The resulting peptides were extracted and the control lanes pooled together. The recovery of the digested peptides in each sample was determined via Nanodrop analysis. The resulting peptides from each sample were tagged with the indicated iTRAQ reagent using the vendor instructions. Samples for each iTRAQ set were mixed 1:1:1:1 based on the peptide Nanodrop reading and loaded onto a Sciex 5600+ nanoflow LC-mass spectrometry system, as previously described.15 Each 4-plex set contained one common control sample made from an equal protein mixture of all samples in the cohort. Measuring protein ratios against a single common control then allows for cross comparison of the relative protein levels among all the samples in the cohort. ProteinPilot software (Sciex) was used to identify the proteins and determine the relative quantitation from each run. A merged search of all runs identified the full scope of proteins detected across all groups. The ProteinPilot data were then processed through Protein Alignment Template software from Sciex. Proteins with a significant fold-change between the UTI and UTC groups (those at >50% change in the average abundance across groups) were identified as proteins of interest. Operators were blinded to sample group until the analysis stage, when unblinding was necessary to interpret the results.",

Indeed, Escherichia coli binds to CD44 in a hyaluronic acid\u2013mediated mechanism and through this interaction invades urothelial cells.33 Furthermore, CD44 knockout mice demonstrate increased bacterial clearance following transurethral inoculation compared with wild type, with no difference noted in neutrophil accumulation or activity.33 However, the increase seen in urinary CD44 in this work is likely related to the fact that CD44 is constitutively expressed on the urothelial cells.33 As one of the responses of the bladder to infection is exfoliation of superficial urothelial cells,34 it is likely that the increased concentration of urinary CD44 seen in patients with UTI in this work is a result of the exfoliated urothelial cells.",

This suggests that the greatest utility of these markers is not in identifying children who may have an infection; rather, they may serve to identify children who likely do not have an infection. There is a need for specific markers of UTI in this population as the currently used markers of UTI (ie, pyuria, leukocyte esterase, and nitrites) have greater sensitivity than specificity.9 A specific marker will have greater utility in this population to identify children who can be safely monitored off of antibiotic therapy. As the rate of antibiotic-resistant organisms is increasing at a significantly faster rate in children with neurogenic bladder compared with those without neurogenic bladder,48 there is a great need to identify children who do not require antibiotics. Both prosaposin and CD44 may serve as specific markers for UTI in children with neurogenic bladders, but future work is needed in larger cohorts to determine an appropriate cut-off and associated predictive accuracy.",

While we report significant elevations in both prosaposin and CD44 in UTI compared with UTC, results from mass spectrometry suggest that these proteins are increased in UTC when compared with UTI. One possible explanation is the different methods of normalization. Samples were loaded into the mass spectrometer based on total protein concentration. While the literature is mixed on the presence of proteinuria in cystitis, there is data to suggest the presence of tubular proteinuria in pyelonephritis.49 It is likely that most patients in the identification arm had pyelonephritis, as they were chosen based on their unequivocal presentation for UTI. Therefore, these patients likely had a higher degree of proteinuria, leading to a smaller amount of urine used for the analysis. Conversely, urine was loaded into the confirmatory assays based on volume, not concentration. Therefore, it is possible that tubular proteinuria in our patients with UTI led to these conflicting results. Indeed, our enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results do display an increase in both prosaposin and CD44 in UTC when compared with children with no growth on urine cultures; this increase was further magnified in the UTI group with added specificity, suggesting their utility as specific markers of UTI in children with neurogenic bladders.",

            "text": "One of the main limitations in this work is the lack of a standardized definition of UTI in patients with neurogenic bladders. There is significant variation in the clinical management of bacteriuria in this patient population, as well as the definition of UTI used in research.3 Therefore, we have chosen a definition that appears in the literature for use in research, but realize that this is still an imperfect definition. To mitigate some of the potential for misclassification bias, we performed an additional review of the patients\u2019 charts to ensure that there was no ambiguity around the classification of either infection or colonization. However, the combination of the definition that we used plus clinical acumen is still imperfect, and thus, the lack of a validated way to differentiate UTI from colonization remains a limitation of this work. Other limitations include the limited number of patients used in both arms of this work, and the inability to better match patients with UTI and UTC in the mass spectrometry arm. Furthermore, we did not perform stability studies on the proteins of interest and are unable to determine whether or not prolonged storage could affect these levels. However, as all urine samples used in this work were stored for the same amount of time, we anticipate this likely did not affect our results of the differentially upregulated proteins. A final limitation is the use of urine creatinine for normalization. We used urine creatinine to standardize the proteins for urine concentration, which may not be the ideal method of standardization in this cohort. Given the differences in body habitus and anthropomorphic measurements in this population, the production of serum creatinine is variable,50 which directly impacts the utility of urine creatinine as a method of normalization. Therefore, the use of urine creatinine may be confounding our results.",
