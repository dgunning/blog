Human infections most frequently occur via close contact with rodent excreta and several arenaviruses, such as the Old World (OW) Lassa and Lujo viruses, as well as the New World (NW) arenaviruses Jun\u00edn, Machupo, Guanarito, and Sabia, which are causative agents of hemorrhagic fever (2). Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is the prototype and most researched arenavirus. LCMV is capable of causing illness ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to aseptic meningitis. Additionally, LCMV has contributed to multiorgan failure and death in organ transplant recipients from undiagnosed, infected organs (3\u20136). The principal rodent host for LCMV is the ubiquitous Mus musculus, which allows for the near global distribution of LCMV (7, 8).",

            "text": "The arenavirus glycoprotein complex is expressed as a polyprotein precursor that undergoes two cleavage events. First, the stable signal peptide (SSP) is cleaved by cellular signal peptidase within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This 58-amino-acid protein is retained as a stable subunit and is critical for downstream, mature glycoprotein complex formation (10\u201312). Second, SSP traffics with immature GP1/2 precursor (amino acids 59 to 498), which undergoes cleavage by the SKI-1/S1P enzyme within the Golgi stacks to yield the GP1 and GP2 subunits (13, 14). The three independent subunits, consisting of the SSP, GP1, and GP2, traffic to the plasma membrane for viral assembly and egress (15\u201318). These three subunits interact noncovalently at the virion surface to bind with host cell receptors to initiate infectivity. The GP1 subunit interacts with the known cellular receptors: \u03b1-dystroglycan (\u03b1-DG) for the OW arenaviruses and transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) for the NW viruses (19, 20). Recent studies using next-generation technologies provided evidence for the involvement of additional host factors for both Jun\u00edn virus and Lassa virus entry (21, 22). The acidification of endocytic vesicles induces irreversible dissociation of the GP1 subunit from the remaining GP2 and SSP subunits, followed by a conformational change within the GP2 subunit to reveal the fusion domains which, in concert with SSP, induce fusion events between the virion and the host membrane to deliver the viral core to the newly infected cell cytoplasm (23, 24).",

Few viruses possess signal sequences that serve additional functions. The Ebola virus signal peptide was shown to modulate the extent of GP glycosylation, thereby moderating the extent of glycoprotein interaction with DC-SIGN/R (26). Additionally, the HIV-1 Env protein signal peptide is thought to regulate glycoprotein folding and maturation (27). In a nonviral model, the prion protein signal peptide interacts with the transmembrane domain for correct protein expression and membrane orientation (28).",

SSP retains a high degree of sequence conservation across Old World and New World signal peptides (Fig. 1B; see also Fig. S1 in the supplemental material) (29). This consensus alignment excludes the boa constrictor-derived arenaviruses, since this group of distantly related viruses expresses a filovirus-like glycoprotein (30). SSP is a key component of the glycoprotein complex that is not recycled within the endoplasmic reticulum but is retained as an essential subunit within purified virions (Fig. 1C). Previous studies have demonstrated a role of basic amino acids within transmembrane protein cytoplasmic domains for the intracellular transport and processing of proproteins into their mature forms (12, 31\u201333). We introduced alanine point mutations in the final two residues within the LCMV GP2 subunit and tested the ability of these constructs to produce a cleaved GP2 subunit, since GPC cleavage into GP1 and GP2 precedes membrane transport (29). Wild-type (WT) GPC with the RR-to-AA mutation, along with the in trans expression of wild-type SSP, resulted in the accumulation of the precursor GPC, which moderately affected levels of processed GP2, as quantified by densitometry analysis (Fig. 1D). The GP1/2 RR-to-AA mutant lacking the native SSP did not produce the cleaved GP2 subunit. We used flow cytometry to measure the surface expression of the glycoprotein using live cells stained with a conformation-specific GP1 antibody (Fig. 1E). Mutations within the WT GPC did not alter the amount of surface GP1 expression. The GP1/2 and the GP1/2 RRAA samples failed to produce a GP1 signal above background levels. Cotransfection of wild-type SSP with both the WT GPC RR-to-AA and with the GP1/2 RR-to-AA protein restored both GP2 processing and surface expression of GP1, suggesting the dibasic motif within the LCMV glycoprotein is not the driving force for secretory pathway trafficking, but rather this function resides within SSP.",

We used a C-terminal hemagglutinin-tagged SSP (SSP-HA) plasmid construct to assess the significance of the SSP for GPC maturation. This construct was previously used to define SSP membrane topology, SSP\u2019s role in pH-dependent fusion, and interactions between SSP and the Z matrix protein (35\u201338). Western blot analysis of HEK 293T cell lysates cotransfected with SSP-HA and the glycoprotein precursor lacking its cognate SSP (GP1/2) resulted in expression of SSP and the GPC but lacked the processed GP2 (Fig. 2). Digestion of transfected cell lysates with the peptide--N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) enzyme to rid N-linked glycans confirmed the GPC was glycosylated (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Detection of the GP2 subunit was rescued upon cotransfection with wild-type SSP, suggesting the HA epitope interfered with SSP-GPC interactions needed for appropriate precursor processing. Since the presence of the epitope at the C terminus interfered with proper glycoprotein complex expression, we inserted the HA epitope in the N-terminal SSP region of the entire glycoprotein open reading frame, downstream of the myristoylation motif (HA SSP GPC). This internally tagged glycoprotein allowed for in cis detection of and experimentation with SSP relative to the remaining glycoprotein subunits. In trans expression of SSP-HA and GP1/2 allowed for precursor cleavage and the detection of the processed GP2 subunit, although this SSP, along with the wild-type SSP, was more rapidly degraded when provided on separate plasmids (Fig. 2).",

We compared glycoprotein expression to phalloidin-defined cell membrane boundaries in the presence or absence of detergent permeabilization using confocal microscopy and a confirmation-specific GP1 antibody (39). In addition, we used the ER chaperone protein Grp78 to determine intracellular glycoprotein complex localization. Wild-type glycoprotein produced a plasma membrane signal with pseudopod-like membrane exvaginations with moderate intracellular Grp8 staining (Fig. 3A). A similar phenotype was produced with in trans coexpression of wild-type SSP and GP1/2 and with HA SSP GPC. Further, the HA SSP GPC allowed for SSP detection at the plasma membrane both with and without detergent treatment. In the absence of detergent permeabilization, the GP1/2 precursor lacking its SSP resulted in the lack of plasma membrane expression and a \u201cleaky\u201d ER staining, which was confirmed by Grp78 staining. Similarly, cotransfection of the SSP-HA and GP1/2 failed to yield plasma membrane detection of the GP complex. Rather, the entire complex was retained within the ER. Taking into account the defect in glycoprotein processing observed in transfected cell lysates (Fig. 2), blocking the SSP C-terminus interferes with the ability of the GP complex to traffic from the ER to the Golgi for processing by the cellular SKI-1/S1P enzyme to produce mature GP subunits (13, 14).",

The AALL GPC was defective in its ability to allow posttranslational modifications and revealed a dominant negative maturation phenotype, since the addition of wild-type SSP did not rescue glycosylated glycoprotein expression or processing (Fig. 4A; see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). The ALLA GPC supported precursor GP posttranslational modifications but was defective in producing a processed GP2 subunit. The ALLA GPC produced a cleavage GP2 subunit with the in trans addition of wild-type SSP (Fig. 4B). The FALA GPC retaining the conserved phenylalanine encoded by all known rodent arenaviruses and resulted in a reduced level of GP2 cleavage from the precursor GPC, while levels of GP2 were increased with the cotransfection of the wild-type SSP. Densitometry analysis of the FALA GPC and wild-type SSP cotransfection, from three independent replicates, resulted in an overall increase in the amount of GPC processed to yield the GP2 subunit, while the representative Western blot in Fig. 4A does not highlight this slight rescue in GP2 processing (Fig. 4B). The YALL GPC resulted in the highest percentage of processed glycoprotein of all SSP mutants we analyzed, though not at the level of the wild-type GP2 cleavage. Interestingly, the cotransfection of the wild-type SSP with YALL GPC resulted in the reduced expression of the total glycoprotein complex. The final variant we examined, YLAL GPC, was toxic to transfected cells and consistently yielded low levels of detectable glycoprotein. Overall, double point mutations within this conserved SSP motif indicate that this entire motif, and not one residue in particular, plays a dominant role in downstream processes that mediate processing of the precursor into mature glycoprotein subunits.",

Our results further differed from previous research using both Old World and New World arenavirus glycoproteins in that the LCMV Armstrong strain (Arm-4) glycoprotein does not utilize basic residues within the GP2 cytoplasmic domain as the driving force for ER exit (12, 33). Our mutational analysis of the GP1/2 subunit containing a mutated basic motif at the ultimate portion of the GP2 cytoplasmic domain did not result in any cleaved GP2 subunit, indicating that this glycoprotein lacking its SSP was not capable of exiting the ER for proteolytic processing. When wild-type SSP was coexpressed with the mutated GP1/2, we detected the processed GP2 subunit. Additionally, our results contrasted Lassa glycoprotein studies which indicated the GP2 cytoplasmic domain played a role in GP maturation cleavage, although the authors did not use a full-length Lassa glycoprotein in their characterizations (44).",

This observation, together with our immunoprecipitation experiments, highlights the critical interactions between the SSP and GP2 subunits.

HA SSP GPC was an expansion of a tool previously used for Jun\u00edn SSP membrane topology characterization, though in those studies SSP was expressed in trans with the remaining portion of the glycoprotein (37). Insertion of the HA epitope did not alter glycoprotein trafficking, as SKI-1/S1P-deficient cells were unable to cleave GPC into mature GP1 and GP2 unless functional SKI-1/S1P was supplemented in trans (data not shown). This HA SSP GPC behaved at wild-type levels in terms of its expression, GP2 cleavage, and plasma membrane localization.

As stated previously, SSP is the most heavily conserved protein throughout the Arenaviridae family, although it is partnered with the GP2 subunit for phylogenetic analyses (7). Results from the expression of the FLLL GPC mutants indicate that each residue within this motif plays an equal role in glycoprotein maturation cleavage. Additionally, the lack of observed fusion activity observed by the HA SSP GPC indicates a defect in one of the final stages of glycoprotein complex assembly, an observation previously noted using internally tagged Jun\u00edn SSP cotransfection assays (37). This lack of fusion activity serves as a limitation for the potential use of the HA SSP GPC in recombinant virus production.",

Additionally, SSP residues at positions 5 and 50, the latter of which resides within this conserved FLLL motif, have been implicated to play roles in LCMV pathogenicity and virus propagation (48). Our microscopy results from the FALA GPC and YALL GPC mutants revealed defects in the progression through the secretory pathway. Levels of processed GP2 from the FALA GPC increased with the addition of supplemented wild-type SSP, although the presence of additional SSP failed to enhance the fusion activity of the glycoprotein. The FALA GPC and the YALL GPC, though producing the cleaved GP2 subunit, both resulted in significant ER and Golgi staining, as well as a greater than 50% reduction in both fusion activity and GP1 surface expression, indicating a defect in post-Golgi intracellular transport. The reduction in membrane localization exhibited by these mutants at 48 h posttransfection indicates an impaired maturation process, as the intracellular staining patterns observed were merely nascent glycoprotein at intermediate maturation stages, as transfection efficiencies were comparable under all conditions. Defects observed by mutating the FLLL motif indicate that this SSP functions as a sorting signal for secretory pathway trafficking.",

Results from the GP1/2 expression, where the glycoprotein completely lacks its native SSP, demonstrated SSP was not required for the posttranslational N-linked glycan modification. AALL GPC and YLAL GPC produced a defective, nonfunctional protein whereby the presence of in trans wild-type SSP was unable to rescue downstream functions for cleavage and transport. These two GPC variants, especially the YLAL GPC, were cytotoxic, likely due to the induction of ER stress responses, as these two mutant GPCs lacked the ability to traffic to the Golgi stacks for precursor processing. In trans SSP expression was able to moderately rescue the ALLA GPC processing, since this mutant GP did produce a glycosylated precursor, thus allowing SSP to provide some chaperone function to an otherwise able (glycosylated) precursor. Based on our fusion assay results, the levels of processed GP2 from the cotransfection of wild-type SSP with the ALLA GPC were not enough to rescue a significant amount of functional glycoprotein. For the FALA GPC and the YALL GPC mutants, the decrease in fusion activity with the in trans wild-type SSP indicated a defect in SSP-mediated transport. This fusion activity defect was likely mediated by ER stress due to unequal ratios and overabundance of SSP relative to the rest of the glycoprotein complex.",

We confirmed this SSP-GP2 interaction, as Schrempf et al. detected the signal peptide via GP2 pulldown experiments (34). Insertion of the FLLL double point mutations within the HA SSP GPC construct was detrimental to GPC expression, although single point mutations within this motif were tolerated. These mutations, while allowing SSP to retain its association with the transmembrane-spanning GP2 subunit, obstructed the interaction with the remaining extracellular spike GP1 subunit.",

Components of all three glycoprotein subunits play a role in the proper glycosylation and proteolytic processing of the glycoprotein complex (43). Without SSP, the glycoprotein precursor is retained within the endoplasmic reticulum and is not capable of continuing its passage through the secretory pathway. Immunoprecipitation of both the SSP and the GP1 subunits revealed that SSP is the subunit that stabilizes the organization of the trimeric glycoprotein complex. Whole-genome small interfering RNA (siRNA) screens have implicated the involvement of the COP1 subunit for LCMV infection (49). Furthermore, proteomic analysis led to the identification of ERGIC-53 as a host factor involved in the production of infectious particles (50). Future experiments using the tools presented here may allow for the identification of host proteins that interact with SSP. A deeper understanding of the mechanism by which this family of viruses involves host pathways would define targets for antiviral therapeutics.",
