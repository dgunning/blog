After its identification, this virus was detected in 4.0% of 642 CSF samples from patients suspected of having an infection of the central nervous system; however, it was not detected in any of the 122 samples from patients with a noninfectious neurologic disease. The viral genome was also found in fecal samples of healthy children, which suggested food-borne or fecal-oral transmission route. In addition, it was found in animal feces, suggesting the existence of animal reservoirs for this virus. These authors affirmed that, considering the current knowledge, it is impossible to establish a causal association between this virus and the disease according to Koch\u2019s criteria or their adapted versions. For further assessment of this association, Tan et al\n26\n are attempting to isolate the virus in cell cultures or animal models and to detect a specific immune response. This is a justifiable caution because a virus found in CSF can be a coinfectious agent \u2013 which would play a secondary role in disease pathology and could increase disease severity or facilitate the entry of other pathogens \u2013, or a latent virus that was reactivated because of an infectious/inflammatory process, or it can simply reflect the detection of a latent virus.\n6\n\n,\n\n22\n\n,\n\n23\n\n,\n\n26\n This discussion is common in cases of detection in CSF of human herpesviruses that are disseminated through the hematogenous route, such as the Epstein-Barr virus and the human herpesvirus 6.\n6\n\n,\n\n22\n\n,\n\n23\n The new cyclovirus could also be like the anelloviruses, which establish chronic active infections, may be devoid of pathogenicity (they can be components of the normal human microflora), and can be found in the central nervous system, blood, and several other body fluids.\n15\n\n",
