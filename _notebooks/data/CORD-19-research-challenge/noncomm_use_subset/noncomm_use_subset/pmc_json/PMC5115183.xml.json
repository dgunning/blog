Three Northern California regional public dog parks within Yolo and Sacramento counties were visited between the months of August and November, 2014, by a computerized randomizer1 to determine the schedule for park visits and fecal collection. Fresh fecal samples were collected from all dogs by their owners during the time of park visitation. A comprehensive questionnaire2 was developed to obtain information on each dog's signalment, lifestyle, environment, and medical history, including whether the animal had been dewormed within the past 6 months. The completed questionnaire, informed owner consent form, and contact information were obtained from each dog's owner at the time of sample collection. A modified Nestl\u00e9 Purina Fecal Scoring chart with color images of different fecal consistencies was utilized by owners to determine their dog's fecal score on a scale of 1\u20136, with a score of 1 representing a hard, dry fecal specimen, and a score of 6 representing a liquid specimen. Fecal scores \u22654 were deemed to be diarrheic. Owners were asked to assess the average consistency of their dog's feces over the previous month before enrolling their dog in the study, as well as on the day of their dog's visit to the dog park. In addition, the investigators determined fecal scores on all but the first 34 fecal specimens at the time of fecal collection. The samples were kept labeled and double\u2010bagged in a temperature\u2010controlled cooler until the end of the 1\u2010 to 2\u2010hour park visit, after which they were separated into 2 aliquots for further processing and evaluation. One aliquot was immediately delivered to the Parasitology Laboratory at UC Davis, and the second aliquot on ice packs was delivered via courier to a veterinary commercial reference laboratory3 within 24 hours of collection.",

The differences in detection of Giardia cysts on fecal flotation between the commercial reference and university laboratories could have been associated with known differences in methods for fecal flotation between the 2 laboratories. The commercial laboratory performed a single centrifugation flotation, and technicians scanned the slide at 10\u00d7 magnification for approximately 60\u2013120 seconds. In contrast, a single parasitologist with over 30 years experience performed all of the flotations at the university laboratory utilizing a double centrifugation flotation technique with evaluation of approximately 50 random high\u2010power fields to determine the average number of cysts, oocysts, or ova per hpf. Interestingly, there were no significant differences between the 2 laboratories in regard to any other parasites detected on fecal flotation. This might be because nematode ova are more readily recognized on a slide because of their size compared to Giardia cysts. These results emphasize that if veterinarians recognize discordant results from different laboratories by similar assays, the laboratories supplying the assays should be alerted to allow for internal investigation into quality assurance.",

            "text": "The relatively high number of dogs with false\u2010negative Giardia PCR results at the commercial reference laboratory is concerning and could have occurred for several reasons. The presence of fecal inhibitors is plausible but was deemed unlikely because a positive internal amplification control was used in all samples and confirmed that no significant inhibitory activity remained in the nucleic acid. The internal sample quality control assessed by targeting a housekeeping gene also indicated good nucleic acid quality at both the gDNA and cDNA level. In addition, 2\u2010fold dilutions of a select number of samples resulted in 1 Ct value weaker signals, confirming the absence of PCR inhibition. The high number of false\u2010negative Giardia PCR results could have been a consequence of PCR test specificity. The Giardia PCR is highly specific for Giardia duodenalis based on the primer sets and does not pick up any other Giardia species, whereas fecal flotation or antibody\u2010based Giardia detection tests are less discriminatory and more likely to detect nonclinically relevant species. In a dog park with a high density of dogs and their feces, combined with a high rodent and bird population, it is conceivable that nonclinical strains of Giardia are accumulated and occur in a high frequency of dogs that accidentally ingest these organisms, in the absence of overt infection. The high number of failed Giardia assemblage PCR tests, which is also Giardia duodenalis specific, could support the specificity aspect. This phenomenon would have to be tested specifically by characterizing Giardia strains by sequencing, which was not an objective of this study.",

            "text": "The reasons for the low amplification rates of DNA for Giardia genotyping were multifactorial and might have been associated with the lack of freshly extracted DNA, the method of DNA extraction, or the presence of Giardia species from birds and rodents that were not Giardia duodenalis. It is also plausible that the amount of Giardia DNA and the gene abundance (single and multicopy genes) was below the assay's detection limit. The results of Giardia genotyping testing of the isolates in this study were in agreement with most previous studies showing assemblage C or D represents the most common assemblages in the dog.15, 29\n",

            "text": "Although fecal consistency correlated with both the presence and number of enteropathogens detected, 62/114 dogs (54%) were nondiarrheic. Thus, positive results obtained for any of the enteropathogens do not prove disease causation. In addition, the discordant findings between the university and the commercial reference laboratories in detection of Giardia cysts and Cystoisospora oocysts via fecal flotation warrant further scrutiny of the methods employed at both laboratories so the diagnostic yield can be increased. The discrepancy in the detection of Cryptosporidium via PCR versus DFA is also concerning because the DFA\u2010positive specimens should have also been PCR positive. These results could be explained by the presence of fecal PCR inhibitors or the incomplete extraction of DNA from oocysts. In addition, all PCR\u2010positive Cryptosporidium cases were DFA negative, which raises questions about the utility of DFA and PCR for diagnosing Cryptosporidium in dogs. The detection reagent in the commercial Cryptosporidium DFA kit utilizes a fluorescein isothiocyanate\u2010labeled monoclonal antibody directed against cell wall antigen of C. parvum, and it is plausible that false\u2010negative results could have been obtained if dogs were infected with C. canis. Lastly, although companion animals may pose a potential risk for zoonotic infections, the frequency of attending dog parks in this study did not significantly increase the risks of infection with an enteropathogen(s).",

The direct fluorescent antibody test is the gold standard for diagnosis of Giardia in humans;32 however, the test was not performed on all 300 fecal specimens due to its relatively high cost. Detection of C. perfringens CPE via ELISA would have also helped improve the diagnosis of C. perfringens and would have been helpful to determine the association between CPE detection and the presence of cpe above threshold.

The lack of specific risk factors is similar to the findings of a study that determined the prevalence of enteropathogens in 100 dogs (50 dogs with normal feces and 50 dogs with diarrhea) at an open\u2010admission municipal animal shelter in Florida.33 Zoonotic enteropathogens were detected in 29 dogs (9.7%) in this study, and most of these dogs had normal feces underscoring the challenges of predicting the risk of infection and zoonotic transmission for individual animals. Pet owners who frequent dog parks should be educated about the potential risks of zoonotic transmission of enteropathogens from dogs, and the fact that a dog with normal feces can pose a risk of zoonotic transmission. Pet owners should also be advised to avoid taking their dog to a dog park if it has diarrhea. This study also highlights important discrepancies in the diagnosis of Giardia via fecal centrifugation flotation between a commercial laboratory and university parasitology laboratory, underscoring the potential for underdiagnosing this enteropathogen at some individual laboratories. The methodology for fecal flotation and improved technician training should be undertaken in an effort to increase the performance characteristics of this test. In addition, the utility of fecal PCR testing for Giardia warrants further investigation to determine the reason(s) for the discrepant results with fecal flotation and DFA testing.",
