As shown in the figure, these 2 drugs inhibit virus titer in a dose-dependent manner. Nitazoxanide reduced infectious ZIKV particles by >100-fold at 10 \u03bcM, whereas tizoxanide completely abolished supernatant ZIKV proliferation at 10 \u03bcM. This inhibition was further demonstrated by immunofluorescence assay detecting the envelope protein expression (Figure 1A) and by Western bot detecting the ZIKV capsid protein (Figure 1B). No cytotoxicity was observed for these 2 drugs under assay concentrations (Figure 1C). We further investigated the kinetics of ZIKV propagation in the presence of these 2 drugs (Supplementary Figure 2), and obvious inhibition was observed. In addition, both drugs inhibited intracellular ZIKV RNA production in a dose-dependent manner under different multiplicity of infections (MOIs) (Supplementary Figure 3). To verify whether nitazoxanide and tizoxanide could inhibit ZIKV in human-derived cells, we performed antiviral experiments in A549 cells, and we found that both drugs could inhibit ZIKV infection in a dose-dependent manner under nontoxic doses (Figure 1D, toxicity data not shown).",

            "text": "Most ZIKV infections are asymptomatic; however, it was associated with congenital brain defects, neurological disorders, and infertility in males, which make it a global public health emergency [5]. Thus, we propose that emergent prophylactic drug use should be considered. An ideal repurposed anti-ZIKV drug should meet all of the following criteria for prophylactic use: (1) they are in class A or B of the FDA pregnancy category; (2) they can be orally administered; (3) they have relative high Cmax compared with in vitro efficacy concentration after oral administration of a current available dosage form, to ensure effective plasma drug exposure; and (4) they have low permeability, or they are impermeable across placental barrier for category B drugs to ensure safety for the fetus. Luckily, nitazoxanide might be the unique drug that meets these criteria to date. It is an orally taken and pregnancy category B drug approved for adults and children above 1-year-old. ",

Cytotoxicity to Vero cells was not observed at 10 \u03bcM for both drugs (Figure 1C). The in vitro anti-ZIKV activity of nitazoxanide does not seem as high as that recently reported for niclosamide [6]; however, niclosamide is only marginally absorbed into blood stream after oral administration. In consideration of multidisciplinary factors, nitazoxanide may be a better anti-ZIKV drug that is worth immediate clinical research.",
