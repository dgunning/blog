            "text": "Leishmania (Order: Kinetoplastida, Family: Trypanasomatidae) is an obligate intracellular parasite responsible for a broad spectrum of diseases, ranging from simple cutaneous to invasive visceral leishmaniasis (1). Protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania present two forms in their life cycle: promastigote, which multiplies in the mid gut of the sand fly vector, and amastigote, the obligate intracellular form that lives within phagolysosomes of the vertebrate host 2., 3.. Three major types of leishmaniasis, namely cutaneous, mucocutaneous and visceral, occur in humans depending on the species of Leishmania. Infection by species such as L. major, L. tropica and L. mexicana may cause localized cutaneous lesions, resulting in lifelong immunity. Infection by L. braziliensis and L. panamensis initially presents as cutaneous lesions that may then spread or metastasize causing mucocutaneous lesions. Infection by L. donovani, L. infantum and L. chagasi may result in a chronic disseminating visceral disease in the liver and spleen (4).",

Proteases are grouped into clans and families on the basis of the architecture of their catalytic dyad or triad (6). Each clan is identified with two letters, the first representing the catalytic type of the families included in the clan. L. major has cysteine proteases (CPs) of eight families within clan CA. Family C1 contains CPA and CPB, which are both cathepsin L-like in terms of primary amino acid sequence, and CPC, which is cathepsin B-like. CPB is unusual in that it has a 100-amino acid C-terminal extension in comparison with most CPs of the group, and exists as multiple isoenzymes, which are encoded by a tandem array of similar CPB genes located in a single locus (the arrays comprise eight genes in L. major). The CPBs of L. mexicana are stage-regulated and the isoforms present differences in their substrate specificity and catalytic properties (7).",

            "text": "Although the exact roles of CPs in Leishmania pathogenesis are unclear, it has been demonstrated that Leishmania cannot grow within macrophages in the presence of CP inhibitors (8). These observations provide evidence of the importance of these molecules in the survival of both promastigote and amastigote forms of these parasites (9). Despite trypanosomatid CPs may be instrumental in modulating the host\u2019s immune response to favor parasite survival and proliferation, they are themselves immunogenic. L. mexicana CP is a T cell immunogen, resulting in the development of potentially protective Thl cell lines (10). This finding suggests that the CP itself is a vaccine candidate and that homologous enzymes in other species may also be so. A CP of L. pifanoi, however, provided rather little protection for the host against infection with the parasite (11), although more recently a similar L. amazonensis CP provided some protection against subsequent challenge, apparently through inducing a Thl-associated response (12). These differing results presumably reflect the complexity of the immune response to the active parasite enzymes and how the response may be determined by the precise immunization conditions. It is therefore encouraging that a CP-rich fraction of L. major was shown to be a strong inducer of a primed human immune response and may have protective function (13). These observations suggest that trypanosomatid CPs have potential as vaccines although attempts to exploit them are really just beginning 14., 15.. In addition, it has also been proven that infected dendritic cells are the critical antigen-presenting cells responsible for T cell priming in Leishmania infections. Amastigotes, but not the infectious promastigotes, are the main targets for phagocytosis activity of dendritic cells 16., 17..",

The objective of this bioinformatics-based study is to enhance the optimal selection of epitopic regions of clan CA, C1 family of cysteine proteases as potential targets of immune response. Consensus sequence methodology was used to identify sequences of 9 amino acids or longer with complete conservation in 80% or more of C1 families of cysteine proteases. These conserved sequences were further analyzed to identify targets for candidate epitope-based T cell vaccine formulations against L. major. Furthermore, concerning the activation of human humoral immunity by leishmaniasis, B cell epitopes were also predicted based on propensity scales for each of the 20 amino acids. Utilizing bioinformatics servers for vaccine candidates is a time-saving approach that could significantly help to increase our information about various aspects of pathogens in molecular biology. These theoretical predictions can then be tested by using experimental and complementary methods.",

In the case of CPB, due to the high similarity between these cysteine proteases, only one out of eight sequences was chosen (LmjF08.1050). This sequence is a good candidate of CPB because of the complete identity of its sequence with the consensus sequence of CPB. All overlapping nonamer peptides were generated from this dataset and were screened for potential T cell antigens using the NetCTL algorithm, from which 716 peptides were short-listed. Most of the peptides were found to exhibit mono-supertype specificity, meaning that they bind to a single supertype. Some of them, however, appeared to bind to multiple supertypes; the highest number of supertypes a given nonamer could bind is 5 out of the 12 supertypes tested. In fact, out of the 716 human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-binding nonamers, one peptide binds to 5 supertypes, 4 bind to 4 supertypes, 9 bind to 3 supertypes and 44 bind to 2 supertypes.

In silico approaches would help to predict some of the HLA-binding motifs, which could act as promiscuous epitopes (34). Most of the generated nonameric peptides in this work are mono-allelic binders. To cover majority of the population, it is essential to have vaccine candidates that have multi-binding behavior. Consequently, peptides with the binding ability of \u22654 supertypes were taken as promiscuous epitopes.
