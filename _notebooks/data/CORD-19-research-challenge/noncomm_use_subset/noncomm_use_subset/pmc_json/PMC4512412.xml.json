While the science and practice of public health surveillance, in\nparticular biosurveillance, has significantly matured since the initial conference in\nNew York City in 2002, practitioners continue to deal with recurring problems, such as\nthe impacts of reduced funding and appropriate data sharing, as well as new ones -\nemerging infectious diseases such as MERS-CoV, Chikungunya, and Ebola, as well as novel\ndata sources from meaningful use and various social media. Many of the abstracts\nselected for oral and lightning presentation take a nuanced approach in examining some\nof these issues.",
