ACT interventions aim at increasing \u201cpsychological flexibility,\u201d which is the core concept of the ACT model of psychological health and behavioral effectiveness. Psychological flexibility is closely connected with individuals\u2019 internal experiences, which could have great impact on psychological and physical function. With satisfying psychological flexibility, individuals could respond to negative thoughts, feelings, and events, thereby improve their well-being flexibly.[161718] ACT treatment involves six core processes (acceptance, cognitive defusion, self-as-context, being present, value, committed action), and acceptance, cognitive defusion, self-as-context, and being present belong to the acceptance and mindfulness process. ACT is becoming an increasingly popular approach that has been applied widely to treat anxiety,[19] depression,[20] diabetes mellitus,[21] chronic pain,[22] cancer,[23] and obesity.[24] The process goal of ACT in those treatments is to enhance the psychological flexibility of participants and finally to achieve better health status. Psychological flexibility was measured by the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ)[25] and its revised version (AAQ-II).[26] Then, measures of psychological flexibility in specific thoughts were developed, such as the Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (CPAQ-20 and CPAQ-8).[27]",

The odd-even split-half reliability is commonly used which helps to avoid some of the potential biases that arise from simply dividing the measurement procedure into two.

The correlation between the WAAQ and AAQ-II was small to moderate, which suggests that both instruments are assessing related constructs, but the correlation is not so high as to suggest that they are assessing the same one. Moreover, the AAQ-II showed lower correlations than the WAAQ with work engagement as measured by the UWES and self-efficacy as measured by the GSES. These findings demonstrated that a work-specific measure of psychological flexibility was more strongly associated with work-related outcomes than a general measure of the same construct. These data replicate the outcomes found by Bond et al.[29] and Ruiz and Odriozola-Gonz\u00e1lez[30] which support the hypothesis that psychological flexibility is related to a specific context as well. However, the AAQ-II showed higher correlations than the WAAQ with psychological distress as measured by the GHQ-12, which may have been because the AAQ-II is a general measure of psychological flexibility. This outcome was different to that elicited previously, possibly because of the features of our study sample. Furthermore, the mean scores of each item in the Chinese version of the WAAQ were lower than those found in the Spanish version, which suggests that the psychological flexibility of the oncology nurses was poor. The Chinese version of WAAQ can measure the psychological flexibility for oncology nurses in workplace. Therefore, the nursing administrators can have some insight into the psychological status of oncology nurses to pay more attention to their mental health in the future.",
