As expected, the PDCoV N protein did not\ncross-react with TGEV, PEDV, PRCV, PRoV, CSFV, PCV-2, PRV and PRRSV in the specificity\nassay. Our results are in line with those of an indirect anti-PDCoV IgG ELISA based on the\nputative S1 portion of the S protein, as described by Thachil et al. [17]. In addition, the N protein exhibited a high degree\nof conservation, 98.8\u2013100% identities, among different PDCoV strains.
