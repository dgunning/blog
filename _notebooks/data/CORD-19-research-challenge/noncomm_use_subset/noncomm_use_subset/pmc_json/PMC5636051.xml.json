The required number of practice Web sites per state was predetermined as a proportion of the providers listed in that state compared with the total number of providers listed on January 29, 2016. All providers listed for a given state were sorted alphabetically and numbered sequentially. Random number lists for each state were generated in Statistical Analysis Software (SAS), version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina). Providers were selected in the order determined by the random number list. We then used the Google Internet search engine to identify each provider's practice Web site.",

Even after the first case of domestic transmission of Zika virus was announced, only 36% of sampled practices were utilizing their Web sites to disseminate information, an increase of just 11% over a 7-month period when disease risks and knowledge of adverse outcomes were increasing. Between these 2 time points, the proportion of practices posting Zika virus information on their practice-sponsored social media accounts actually decreased by 6% and 4% in the case of Facebook and Twitter, respectively.

While the total number of Web sites that posted Zika virus information increased over the course of the study, the number of Web sites posting advice on the use of insect repellent and travel advisories to affected areas decreased from January to August. This unexpected decrease could be a cause for concern, as the onset of non\u2013travel-associated transmission drastically increases the at-risk population within the United States. With localized transmission a reality, it is important that individuals, particularly pregnant women, understand the potential risks associated with traveling to areas with ongoing transmission. One hypothesis for the decreases we observed in important prevention-related topics may be an unfortunate side effect of the current paradigm of health information dissemination. As the Zika virus knowledge base expanded over the course of the emergency, posted information began to shift focus to emerging topics. Protective activities such as using insect repellent or avoiding travel to affected areas may have been deemphasized under an assumption of \u201ccommon knowledge.\u201d Public health professionals creating resources for and conducting outreach to providers should consider emphasizing the importance of continually promoting the most effective risk-reduction behaviors, no matter how \u201ccommon.\u201d",

Our finding that larger, hospital-affiliated practices were significantly more likely to post content about Zika virus may be particularly indicative of this hypothesis. This could be explained by the fact that large hospitals generally have dedicated information technology (IT) departments focused on maintaining and updating their Web sites. Because it is unreasonable to expect smaller private practices to have significant IT resources, public health organizations that are developing resources for providers to disseminate to their patients should be mindful of this inequity. The most well-designed patient-centered public health communication materials may never be utilized by the majority of providers if posting the content on their Web sites is not easy. If public health practitioners develop downloadable materials or content for provider Web sites, they should specifically focus on low-maintenance tools (eg, widgets, microsites) that include explicit uploading instructions.",

It may be prudent for public health organizations to put more effort into organizing online resources in such a way that it is extremely clear who should use the resource (eg, obstetric care providers, pediatricians, other public health practitioners), what distribution modality the resource is suited for (eg, handout, poster, Web site), and who the target audience is (eg, pregnant women, women considering pregnancy, men).",

In January, we reviewed historic social media posts for up to 36 days (January 1-February 5), whereas in August, our historical review included only a maximum of 18 days (July 29-August 15) to coincide with the initial official announcement of localized transmission in the United States. What we do know, however, is that our 2 review time periods coincided with periods of the highest Google search volume for \u201cZika virus\u201d to date in 2016 (see Figure 2, Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/JPHMP/A305, which shows the Google Trends data described in this article).19 To have obstetric care providers not utilizing their most prominent Web resources during this time is a clear and reconcilable gap in public health risk communication.",
