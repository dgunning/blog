            "text": "Most beef operations wean by abruptly separating the cow and calf, usually at a much younger age than in a natural or self-weaning situation (Hudson et al., 2010). The results of abrupt weaning are well documented and consistent, as cows and calves spend more time walking and vocalizing and less time resting or eating (Veissier and Le Neindre, 1989). Excessive vocalizations can increase the respiratory tract\u2019s susceptibility to infectious pathogens that can lead to bovine respiratory disease (BRD; Loerch and Fluharty, 1999), which is considered the biggest health challenge facing the cattle industry (Duff and Galyean, 2007). Alternative weaning strategies such as fence line weaning (Nicol, 1977) and 2-stage weaning with a plastic nose weaning clip (Haley et al., 2001) have been investigated and both strategies positively influence behavior (Price et al., 2003; Haley et al., 2005); however, impacts on performance are inconclusive.",

            "text": "Trace minerals (TMs) are essential to the health and growth of cattle (Underwood and Suttle, 1999). Newly weaned and received cattle are often stressed and have a decreased dry matter intake (DMI; Ceciliani et al., 2012), which could result in limited TM intake. In addition, the status of newly received animals entering a feedlot is largely unknown and is challenging for producers to assess. The National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (2016) recommends increasing diet TM concentrations for stressed cattle to 150% that of normal requirements. An injectable trace mineral (ITM) may ensure each animal receives the targeted amount of TM (Arthington et al., 2014) regardless of initial TM status, stress level, and eating behavior. However, likely due to variations in initial mineral status across herds, performance responses to ITM at times of weaning and receiving have been variable (Richeson and Kegley, 2011; Arthington et al., 2014; Genther-Schroeder and Hansen, 2015).",

On day 0, calves were removed from dam, weighed, plastic calf weaner devices were removed from two-stage weaned calves, and ORC calves were shipped via commercial trucking 272 km to Urbana, IL. Calves from Urbana were shipped via commercial trucking for an equal distance as ORC cattle so that calves from both facilities were subjected to similar shipping time and stress. Upon arrival, calves were reweighed and pre-trucking and arrival BW were used to calculate a percent trucking BW shrink for each calf. Upon arrival, calves were sorted by source and treatment and randomly assigned to pens (5\u20137 steers per pen [4.88 \u00d7 10.36 m]). Calves were housed in two identical barns. Barns were constructed of a wood frame with a ribbed metal roof and with siding on the north, west, and east sides. The south side of the barn was covered with polyvinyl chloride\u2013coated 1.27 \u00d7 1.27 cm wire mesh bird screen and equipped with retractable curtains for wind protection. Pens had slatted concrete floors covered by interlocking rubber matting. Weaning method was separated by barn to minimize influence of other treatment on behavior. Calves were fed in 4.27 m concrete feed bunks and were offered ad libitum access to a receiving diet from day 0 to 6, a transition diet from day 7 to 42, a step-up diet from day 43 to 53, and a growing diet from day 54 to 124 (Table 1). All calves were weighed again on days 41, 42, 123, and 124. Day 0 to 42 was referred to as the receiving period. The growing period was considered to be from day 42 to 124 and overall period was considered day 0 to 124. Average BW from days 41 and 42 and days 123 and 124 were used to calculate average daily gain (ADG) for receiving and growing periods, respectively. Incidence of morbidity was recorded daily by animal care personnel throughout the duration of the trial.",

These calves exhibit increased behavioral stress, with excess walking and vocalization (Veissier and Le Neindre, 1989) that can lead to an increased susceptibility to respiratory tract infections (Loerch and Fluharty, 1999). In addition, even with an adequate TM status (though this is often unknown), due to this additional stress, these animals may also have a greater TM requirement. Therefore, the authors hypothesized that an ITM may be most beneficial in the more stressed, abruptly weaned calves. Steers were housed in two identical barns that were adjacent to each other and were separated by weaning strategy. The authors acknowledge that weaning strategy is potentially confounded by barn; however, calves were segregated by weaning strategy to minimize the impact of calf behavior from one weaning treatment on calf behavior in the other treatment. There were no weaning strategy \u00d7 ITM interactions for BW or ADG throughout the experiment. In contrast, experiments by Arthington et al. (2014) and Genther-Schroeder and Hansen (2015) showed that stressed calves that received an ITM actually had decreased ADG initially following stress compared to calves receiving saline injections. Genther-Schroeder and Hansen (2015) then followed those calves\u2019 performance for the remainder of a 78-d growing period and noted no effect of an ITM on calf ADG. This is also in contrast to this experiment, where there was a tendency for ITM to improve overall (day 0 to 124) ADG. Arthington et al. (2014) also reported a trend for ITM to increase ADG in growing heifers.",

This is supported by Hickey et al. (2003) and Lefcourt and Elsasser (1995) who also reported no effect of weaning on cortisol response. Due to the limited sampling time points in this experiment and that these calves came from a well-managed herd and were used to human interaction, it is possible that peak cortisol concentrations that may have been associated with weaning were simply missed.

Although authors expected abruptly weaned steers to spend more time walking after separation due to greater stress, it is difficult to explain why AbtMM steers walked more than AbtSAL steers. As hypothesized, the current study showed that two-stage weaned steers vocalize less frequently than abruptly weaned steers on both days 1 and 2 and there was a lower percentage of two-stage weaned steers standing and walking on day 1 compared to abruptly weaned steers. In addition, two-stage weaned steers spent more time lying on day 1 and eating on both days 1 and 2 compared to abruptly weaned steers. This is similar to previous observations (Haley et al., 2001, 2005) that on days 2 and 3 after separation that calves weaned in two stages with the use of anti-suckling nose flaps walk less, spend more time eating, more time lying, and less time standing than calves weaned by traditional abrupt separation. These mentioned findings clearly demonstrate that two-stage weaned calves display less behavioral signs of stress upon separation from the dam than calves weaned by the traditional abrupt separation method. However, calves were not observed for behavior and vocalizations during the 6 d while nose flaps were inserted in two-stage weaned calves, so there is no data to compare behavioral stress of treatment groups prior to separation. Though cortisol levels were not different, based on behavior parameters, it is possible that the two-stage weaned calves were not as stressed upon entering the feedlot compared to the abruptly weaned calves. However, a potentially more complicated interaction between ITM and level of stress may exist.",
