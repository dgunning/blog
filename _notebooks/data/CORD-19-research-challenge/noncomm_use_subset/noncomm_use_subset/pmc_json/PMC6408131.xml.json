Primary immune deficiency (PID), as well as HIV infection, malignancy, and transplantation, are known as risk factors for PCP,[3] and PCP can be an initial clinical manifestation of PID.[4\u20136]",

He exhibited no medical problems at or after birth. Two weeks prior, fever, vomiting, and diarrhea developed, and he was treated for acute gastroenteritis at a primary clinic. However, he visited the emergency room and pediatric outpatient clinic of our hospital with persisting vomiting and diarrhea 9 and 6 days before, respectively. His vomiting and diarrhea had continued since then, and moreover, peripheral and central cyanosis accompanied. On admission, he was afebrile and exhibited no respiratory symptoms including cough, rhinorrhea, and sputum.

Physical examination revealed no accessory breathing sounds on chest auscultation and chest wall retractions despite tachypnea. Chest X-ray showed bilateral diffuse haziness without definite cardiomegaly (Fig. 1A). Echocardiography revealed an ejection fraction of 78.7% without any anatomical and functional abnormalities. Blood tests revealed a white blood cell count of 22,250/mm3, hemoglobin levels of 16.5 g/dL, platelet count of 536,000/mm3, and C-reactive protein levels <0.02 mg/dL without any abnormal findings in blood chemistry. We suspected interstitial lung disease of non-infectious causes or afebrile viral pneumonitis, and a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for respiratory viruses was performed using a nasopharyngeal swab. Although there were no family and individual histories consistent with PID, a PCR test for Pneumocystis jirovecii was also performed using a nasal swab, considering interstitial pneumonitis accompanying severe hypoxemia without accessory breathing sounds. After admission, his respiratory rate increased to 60 to 90 breaths/min, and mechanical ventilator care was initiated on hospital day (HD) #2. Empirical intravenous trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX; 5 mg/kg of TMP thrice a day) treatment for possible PCP was also initiated on HD #2. Methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg twice a day) was also administered for possible interstitial pneumonitis of non-infectious causes. Chest computed tomography showed diffuse homogeneous opacity occupying alveolar spaces throughout the whole lung fields (Fig. 2). The multiplex PCR test for respiratory viruses revealed negative results for influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, and human bocavirus. Bronchoscopy was performed on HD #3; however, any findings of definite airway inflammation and increased pulmonary secretion were not observed. The results of the PCR test for P. jirovecii performed on admission were reported as positive on the evening of HD #3. After then, negative culture results for bacteria, cytomegalovirus, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis were reported in bronchial washing fluid samples; cysts of P. jirovecii were observed on Gomori methenamine silver stains of bronchial washing fluids. Weaning of ventilator care and tapering of methylprednisolone doses were initiated on HDs #6 and #8, respectively. Chest X-ray findings showed improvement 2 weeks since initiating treatment (Fig. 1), and he was extubated on HD #23. Oxygen supply and methylprednisolone treatment were completed on HDs #28 and #29, respectively. A repeat PCR test for P. jirovecii showed a positive result 3 weeks after initiating TMP/SMX treatment. The PCR test showed a negative result 4 weeks after initiating treatment, and the TMP/SMX treatment was converted to prophylaxis (150 mg/m2/day of TMP, thrice a week on alternate days) on HD #29. He was discharged from the hospital on continuing TMP/SMX prophylaxis on HD #34.",

IgG (557 mg/dL) and IgM (74 mg/dL) levels were within normal limits; however, IgA and IgE levels could not be measured. Immunoglobulin levels measured 1 month after admission showed similar results. Genetic studies for HIGM syndrome were requested based on the repeated results of the immunologic tests. One month after discharge, a novel frameshift mutation on exon 1 of the CD40 ligand (CD40L) gene was identified using gene sequencing. The identical mutation was identified in his mother as a heterozygote, and the patient was eventually diagnosed with X-linked HIGM syndrome. TMP/SMX prophylaxis and intravenous immunoglobulin replacement therapy every 3 weeks was continued. He underwent unrelated, matched peripheral blood stem cell transplantation 8 months after the diagnosis of PCP, and 20 months have passed after transplantation without severe complications.",

            "text": "HIGM syndrome is caused by a defect in the CD40-CD40L signaling pathway.[8,9] It causes a limitation in immunoglobulin isotype switching in B cells, and therefore, normal or elevated IgM levels with low IgG, IgA, and IgE levels are observed.[8,9] Our patient showed normal IgG levels, which were thought to be due to maternal antibodies transferred across the placenta. The normal IgM levels and undetected IgA and IgE levels with an increased proportion of CD19+ cells raised the suspicion of HIGM syndrome. HIGM syndrome manifests as a T cell dysfunction rather than a B cell dysfunction, despite hypogammaglobulinemia, because most cases are caused by a mutation of the CD40L gene located at the X chromosome which encodes CD40L on the T cell surface.[8\u201311] Therefore, X-linked HIGM syndrome is the most frequent form of HIGM syndrome.[8,9] However, several other genes mutated and involved in CD40-CD40L signaling pathway or DNA repairing system in immunoglobulin isotype switching can cause HIGM syndrome, namely: CD40, activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AICDA), uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic delta (PIK3CD), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 alpha (PIK3R1), nuclear factor-kappa-B essential modulator (NEMO/IKK\u03b3), inhibitor of kappa light chain gene enhancer in B cells, alpha (I\u03baB\u03b1), nuclear factor kappa-B subunit 1 (NFKB1) genes participating in CD40-CD40L signaling pathway and post meiotic segregation increased 2 (PMS2), MutS Homolog 6 (MSH6), MutS Homolog 2 (MSH2), ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), Nibrin/Nijmegen breakage syndrome 1 (NBS1/NBN) genes involved in DNA repairing system.[8,9] Most forms of these mutations are expressed through autosomal recessive inheritance, although autosomal dominant inheritance has also been reported.[8,9] Therefore, genetic evaluation should be performed in patients with HIGM syndrome phenotype to verify the exact disease mechanism and perform accurate genetic counseling.",

In particular, PCP is hardly suspected in children with pneumonia who have no evidence of an underlying immunocompromised state. However, pediatricians should consider that PCP can be an initial clinical presentation of PID,[4\u20136] and therefore, PCP should be suspected in infants with severe interstitial pneumonia accompanying normal breathing sounds when common viral and bacterial pathogens are not identified, even though the infants may show no evidence of immune deficiency. In addition, underlying PID should be evaluated in infants diagnosed with PCP using recently developed molecular genetic techniques.",
