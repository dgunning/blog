Specimens were first tested by single-plex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for influenza. Specimens were then tested by 2 assays: (1) target\u2010enriched multiplex PCR (TEM-PCR; Diatherix Laboratories, Inc, Huntsville, AL) and (2) BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel (FilmArray; BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT). The panels have 8 viral (human rhinovirus/enterovirus [HRV/EV], influenza A, influenza B, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus [hMPV], adenovirus [ADV]) and 3 bacterial (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae) pathogens in common. Specimens were selected based on availability, and tests were performed in separate laboratories. Kappa (\u03ba) coefficients and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed.",

Of the 308 specimens with complete results, TEM-PCR and FilmArray detected at least 1 viral pathogen among 197 (64.0%) and 198 (64.3%) specimens, respectively. The frequency of viral codetection (i.e. 2 or more viral pathogens in a specimen) was 7.1% for TEM-PCR and 6.5% for BioFire FilmArray (p = 0.67; McNemar's test). Only 1 (0.3%) specimen was positive for C pneumoniae by FilmArray, and neither assay detected B pertussis. Pathogen-specific agreement between the panels was as follows: HRV/EV (\u03ba = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.66\u20130.84), coronavirus (\u03ba = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.86\u20130.97), RSV (\u03ba = 0.85; 95% CI, 0.77\u20130.94), parainfluenza (\u03ba = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.91\u20131), hMPV (\u03ba = 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74\u20130.96), ADV (\u03ba = 0.21; 95% CI, \u22120.15 to 0.58), and M pneumoniae (\u03ba = 0.72; 95% CI, 0.42\u20131).",
