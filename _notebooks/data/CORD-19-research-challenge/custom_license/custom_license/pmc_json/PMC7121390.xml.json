Smith attributes the specific expression, with its Latin version, to Thomas Sydenham (1624\u20131689), whom we remember for his classic descriptions of disease [3]. Herranz tells that the maxim to \u201cfirst, do no harm\u201d entered the fabric of British and American medicine in 1849 when it was used in a book by Worthington Hooker titled Physician and Patient [4]. Today, I would wager that, whether in English or in Latin, there is not a US medical student who has survived to the clinical years who is not familiar with this adage.",
