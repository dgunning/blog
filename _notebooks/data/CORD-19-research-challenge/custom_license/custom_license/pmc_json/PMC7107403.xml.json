Adults aged \u226560 years were recruited through their general practitioner or through the Civil Registry. For the second season, participants were reinvited and additional participants were recruited through the Civil Registry. We also started earlier to use the same monitoring period as in the Dutch sentinel surveillance system [11]. There were no exclusion criteria for the study. Influenza vaccination status was recorded (2009\u20132012). Participants were part of the study for the entire duration of each season and contacted at the end of season to verify participation. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. All trial-related activities were conducted according to Good Clinical Practice, which includes the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the acknowledged ethical committee METC Noord Holland (http://www.trialregister.nl; NTR3386).",

The analysis is restricted to the period that influenza virus was circulating in the Netherlands for that particular season, defined by the national influenza surveillance weekly reports. Participants with <14 days between the date of vaccination and the date of home visit were excluded from the VE analysis, as it is uncertain whether the vaccine already had any effect in this period. Second and third ILI periods were included in the analysis only if an earlier ILI period was influenza virus negative. For ILI participants, influenza virus positive was considered \u201ccase\u201d and influenza negative \u201ccontrol.\u201d The VE is calculated as (1 \u2013 odds ratio [OR]) \u00d7 100% with 95% confidence interval (CI) and is calculated per influenza virus subtype or lineage. The following factors were regarded as potential confounders: period in the season (early and late season), sex, smoking, comorbidity, and age (natural smoothing spline, 4 degrees of freedom). The association between the potential confounders and influenza virus positivity (any subtype) was analyzed with univariate logistic regression. Variables with P < .20 were considered in the multivariable analysis. Variables that changed the OR by at least 5% are included in the final multivariable logistic regression model for any influenza subtype (backward selection). All analyses were performed with SAS version 9.4 software. Sensitivity analyses were performed in the VE analyses for other control groups (Supplementary Materials).",

However, this policy is based on studies mostly performed in elderly persons in nursing homes, who are substantially older and more frail compared with community-dwelling elderly individuals. Studies in community-dwelling older adults are scarce [7\u201310], and only a restricted number of pathogens have been analyzed in these surveillance studies. To fill the gap in knowledge, we recruited participants through general practitioners and the Civil Registry, resulting in >99% of the participants living in the community. In line with the risk-based vaccination strategy in the Western world, older participants and participants with chronic conditions were more likely to be vaccinated [2].

Viruses can often be detected in individuals without clinical manifestations [7], but when they are found as the sole agent in the context of disease, they are commonly considered to be the cause of the disease. For bacteria, this is less clear as they are commonly carried in asymptomatic persons but may expand during respiratory viral infection or new acquisition. Haemophilus influenzae may induce an enhanced inflammatory state in the presence of other pathogens, as was shown in children [23]. This may lead to ILI.

The significant increase in attack rate for influenza virus could be attributed to the influenza virus subtypes A/H1N1pdm09 and influenza B. Influenza A/H3N2 was the predominant influenza virus subtype in both the 2011\u20132012 and 2012\u20132013 seasons, with similar attack rates. In contrast, the Dutch and European networks monitoring nursing homes reported a high ILI incidence and mortality in the 2011\u20132012 season [24, 25].

This may be explained by assuming that a pool of people exists that is highly susceptible to respiratory infections. The reduction by vaccination in the number of cases caused by influenza virus infections is offset by a rise in the number of cases caused by infections by other pathogens. Cowling et al have described a similar increased risk of noninfluenza respiratory virus infection in influenza-vaccinated children [26]. However, we cannot attribute this effect to a specific pathogen. Influenza virus may take preference over other viruses and prevent them from filling the niche, possibly by inducing a prolonged antiviral state, as has been described for other viruses [23, 27]. When vaccination reduces influenza virus infections, the other pathogens can fill the gap.",

We also show that influenza vaccination was effective in reducing the incidence of influenza virus infections but did not reduce the ILI incidence, which may have important public health and healthcare consequences. Our data will also help to better inform the public what to expect from influenza vaccination and how it will not protect against all cases of ILI, popularly seen as \u201cflu.\u201d",
