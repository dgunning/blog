In China, the masked palm civet is considered a delicacy, and was sold in markets in Guandong, Guangxi and Hong Kong (Tan, 1989). People started eating masked palm civets in the 1950s and this increased to a larger scale after the 1990s (Jiang et al., 2003). Civet farming began to develop very quickly all over China and, by 2003, there were 660 farms in China, with a total of 40 000 civets (Jiang et al., 2003). In farms from the Hubei province, captive civets were reported as locally trapped, and newly trapped animals were regularly brought to the farms (pers. obs.). However, this may not be typical of other farms, where captive breeding may be the main source of animals.",

Whether the infected market civets had been trapped in the wild or were from farms is not known. Their geographic origin was uncertain and, as wildlife trade from neighbouring countries to China is important (see Li & Li, 1997; Bell, Robertson & Hunter, 2004), it is vital to develop a tool to identify their geographic origin. Although the SARS\u2010like CoV has now been discovered in horseshoe bats as well (2005a, 2005b, 2005 have described the role played by masked palm civets as intermediate hosts during the 2003/2004 outbreak in Guangdong.

For this purpose, we sequenced a portion of two mitochondrial genes, the cytochrome b (Cytb) and the control region (CR), both shown to be suitable markers for carnivore species phylogeography (e.g. 2007, 2005a, 2005b, 2006, 2007), and analysed five polymorphic microsatellite markers in Chinese wild and farmed populations.",

Comparison of alleles' number between different sample sizes and measurement of the allelic richness (i.e. number of alleles independent of sample size) were performed using the program FSTAT v 2.9.3 (Goudet, 2001). A Hardy\u2013Weinberg (HW) test for each locus in each population and global tests for all populations were performed with Genepop (Raymond & Rousset, 1995). The program FSTAT was also used to test for linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the polymorphic loci within each species and calculate two different measures of the genetic differentiation over subpopulations (F\nst, Kimura & Crow, 1964; R\nst, Kimura & Ohta, 1978) as well as inbreeding coefficients (F\nis). The sequential Bonferroni correction was applied to derive significance levels for the analysis involving multiple comparisons (Rice & Gaines, 1989). The genetic divergence between each pair of six palm civet populations based on allele frequencies was calculated according to Nei's DA genetic distance (Nei, Tajima & Tateno, 1983) using Population v 1.2.28 (http://www.cnrs-gif.fr). Genetic distances; trees were also constructed from these genetic distances values using the neighbour\u2010joining clustering (Saitou & Nei, 1987). Bootstrap re\u2010sampling (n=1000) was performed to assess the robustness of dendrogram topologies. We also used a clustering method that does not use a spatial prior, as implemented in Structure 2.0 (Pritchard, Stephens & Donnelly, 2000), to detect the maximum number of populations (K), five independent runs of K=1\u20136 were performed with 1 \u00d7 106 MCMC repeats and a burn\u2010in of 1 \u00d7 106. K was identified using the maximal values of Ln P\n(D) (the posterior probability of the data for a given K). Moreover, the program Bottleneck v1.2.02 was used to test for heterozygosity excess and to determine whether allele distributions within populations had been affected by recent changes in the size of the two wild populations (Cornuet & Luikart, 1996; Luikart & Cornuet, 1998).",

Veron, pers. obs.), suggesting unlinked evolutionary mechanisms at the molecular and morphological levels in this species. In fact, the relationships between morphological and molecular evolution have long been debated (e.g. 2002, 1997). An empirical study on rodents (Renaud, Chevret & Michaux, 2007) concluded that correlations between morphological and molecular evolution can be lost when organisms had to answer to an ecological change. In this case, morphological changes may occur rapidly (as observed in specialized taxa; e.g. semi\u2010aquatic genet Genetta piscivora, which exhibits very distinctive morphological features but small genetic distance values to other genets, Gaubert et al., 2004). In the masked palm civet, two main morphotypes can be distinguished and their distribution limit appears to be located in southern Thailand by the study of a high number of museum specimens (n=225; from AMNH, New York; BMNH, London; MCZ, Cambridge; MNHN, Paris; USNM, Washington; Institute of Zoology, Beijing; and observation of wild and captive individuals, G. Veron, pers. obs.). Specimens from Malaysia and Indonesia do not have the black and white head pattern, but have a yellowish face, and their body colour is dark brown. Specimens from the other parts of the range display the typical black and white head pattern with a conspicuous white longitudinal band on the nose, and the body colour is lighter, varying from beige, yellowish and grey to light brown. The northern morphotype seems to display much more variability in the colour and head pattern than the southern one. The head and body length of the northern and southern morphotypes does overlap, while Hainan and Taiwan specimens are smaller (head and body length not exceeding 540 and 600 cm, respectively) than specimens from other populations (head and body length up to 790 cm).",

In our study, except for one individual (C\u2010399), which was only connected to the root haplotype, other samples from Japan shared haplotypes with Vietnam and Taiwan individuals or were closely linked to them.

Civet trade is important (Bell et al., 2004) and farming in China was conducted on a large scale. We found no museum specimens (n=225) having localities more northerly than 30\u00b09\u2019N. Corbet & Hill (1992) mapped the distribution up to 35\u00b00\u2019N in China; nowadays, the species is recorded as far north as 39\u00b09\u2019N (Zhang, 1997). The lack of genetic variability and of structure within the Chinese samples does not agree with the division of the Chinese populations into nine subspecies as suggested by Gao (1987) and Jiang et al.

The greatest genetic differentiation occurred between Shanxi and Sichuan farm populations (F\nst=0.132), which indicated that perhaps they originated from two distinct populations. The lowest genetic differentiation occurred between Hubei wild and farm populations (F\nst=\u22120.001), which was consistent with the fact that all individuals in Hubei farm were cultured many years ago from the Hubei wild population. There was also reduced differentiation between the Hubei and the Sichuan wild populations (F\nst=0.018).

However, three main haplogroups were put forward while the individuals from Malaysia and Indonesia exhibited a putatively higher genetic diversity. The Chinese farmed populations did not exhibit a lower genetic diversity than the Chinese wild populations, and this probably resulted from bringing in new wild individuals regularly. By these captures, the wild population may be at risk.
