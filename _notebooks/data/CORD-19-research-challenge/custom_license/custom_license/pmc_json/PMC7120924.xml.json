            "text": "Widespread deforestation has been one of the most dramatic and biologically profound changes to our global landscape. Over the past 300 years, we have cut down between 7 and 11 million km2 of forest\u2014an area the size of the continental United States. Approximately, two million km2 of natural \u201cforest\u201d in temperate and tropical regions are now highly managed plantations with significantly reduced biological diversity (Foley et al. 2005). Deforestation alters biological composition and complexity, soil dynamics, biogeochemical cycles, surface water chemistry, ambient air temperature, exposure to sunlight, and hydrological cycles. It creates forest edges which provides new habitat for a variety of disease vectors and often creates an active interface between human populations and forest-dwelling vectors and host species. Not surprisingly, it has impacts on infectious disease exposure, particularly to vector-borne and zoonotic diseases. Vector-borne diseases are caused by pathogens that are transmitted from one individual to another by an intermediary organism\u2014usually an arthropod such as a mosquito or a tick. Common examples include malaria and Lyme disease. Zoonoses are diseases that exist in both human and non-human vertebrates and, therefore, have natural host reservoirs in the non-human community. Yellow fever (monkeys) and rabies (dogs, raccoons, foxes, skunks, etc.) are common examples. In this section, we focus on tropical deforestation because very little is known about the infectious disease threats of temperate deforestation, with the exception of the well-described relationship between forest fragmentation and increased risk for Lyme disease in temperate forests (LoGiudice et al. 2003).",

Malaria is transmitted by a number of different species of Anopheles mosquito. In order to understand the effect of deforestation on malaria, it is necessary to know which species of mosquito are responsible for transmission in a given location and what their breeding habitats and feeding preferences are. Understanding the ecology of the species that transmit malaria locally, including their breeding habitat, feeding preferences, behavior, and environmental niche is essential to understanding the effects of deforestation on the spread of malaria. This, in turn, is essential to predicting the spread of the disease and developing effective control measures.",

While there are over 50 different Anopheles mosquito species in this region, only one appears to be an important vector of malaria: Anopheles darlingi (Guerra et al. 2006b). A. darlingi prefers to breed in partly shaded pools with slightly acidic pH. Slash and burn land clearing and road building change the chemical composition of the soil, reduce shading, and often create small pools of water with ideal conditions for A. darlingi. As a result, deforestation favors breeding of this vector (Singer and de Castro 2001) and has been shown to increase malaria exposure in the Amazon (Tadei et al. 1998). In the Peruvian Amazon, investigators found that biting rates of A. darlingi in deforested areas were 278 times higher than biting rates in forested areas (Vittor et al. 2006). These findings supported earlier work showing strong associations between deforestation and malaria and epidemiological evidence of malaria surges following periods of deforestation.",

Anopheles nili and A. moucheti have more localized distributions and are considered \u201csubsidiary\u201d vectors. Of these four, A. nili is considered a localized forest species with a relatively limited role in transmission (Carnevale et al. 1992). As in the Amazon, deforestation increases habitat for the primary African malaria vectors; it is, therefore, not surprising that a number of studies have found associations between deforestation and increased malaria exposure in sub-Saharan Africa (Coluzzi et al. 1979; Coluzzi 1984, 1994; Cohuet et al. 2004). A recent review of these and other studies of the relationships between deforestation and malaria concluded that deforestation in sub-Saharan Africa tends to increase malaria transmission (Guerra et al. 2006b). Given the breeding preferences of the primary malaria vectors in Africa, this generalization is likely to hold, although exceptions may well be identified in specialized breeding areas.",

An elegant series of investigations by Afrane and colleagues (Afrane et al. 2005, 2006) has gone beyond counting the density of anopheline vectors in forested versus deforested areas. In experiments performed in the western Kenya highlands, they evaluated how deforestation may affect the lifecycle of Anopheles species through microclimatic change and showed that, by reducing shading, deforestation raises the average temperature in homes by 1.8\u00b0C and in nearby aquatic habitats by 4.8\u20136.1\u00b0C. These ambient temperature changes are associated with much shorter reproductive cycles (nearly 60% shorter), reduced larva-to-adult developmental time, and increased larval and adult survivorship all of which improve the vectorial capacity of the mosquitoes and increase exposure to malaria (Afrane et al. 2005, 2006). For example, as a result of increased ambient temperatures in deforested areas, A. arabiensis has a 49\u201355% higher adult life span and a reproductive rate about twice that in forested areas.",

            "text": "In Asia, the relationship between deforestation and malaria appears to be more complex. In part, this is because there are a wider variety of Anopheles species that are effective malaria vectors and that have more variable habitat preferences. Unlike the Americas and Africa where higher rates of transmission occur after deforestation, much of the malaria transmission in Asia occurs in intact forested areas. Almost all of the malaria transmission in Bangladesh in 1989 occurred in forests (Sharma et al. 1991). In India in 1987, 7% of the human population lived in forested areas but contributed to 30% of the malaria cases in the country (Narasimham 1991). In fact, deforestation has driven down the density of important malaria vectors including A. dirus, A. minimus, and A. barbirostris in Thailand, Nepal, India, and Sri Lanka. However, it has also caused an increase in the density of alternative vectors including A. fluviatilis, A. annularis, A. jamesii, A. nigeririmus, A. subpictus, and A. peditaeniatus (Amerasinghe and Ariyasena 1990; Konradsen et al. 1990; Karla 1991; Taylor 1997). In a comprehensive review of over 60 studies of land use change and malaria, Yasuoka and Levins describe the unpredictable nature of the impacts of these complex changes. In Kanchanaburi, Thailand, widespread deforestation from 1986 to 1995 eliminated breeding sites for A. dirus and decreased malaria incidence. However, in northeast India, deforestation increased malaria transmission by replacing the historical vector A. minimus with A. fluviatilis that has since become more abundant (Yasuoka and Levins 2007). In Sri Lanka, deforestation has driven major malaria epidemics (Konradsen et al. 1990). While anopheline ecology is particularly complex in Asia, it conforms, nonetheless, to a general trend throughout the world: deforestation tends to reduce mosquito diversity and the surviving dominant species, for reasons that are not well understood, are almost always more effective vectors for malaria than earlier vectors (Molyneux et al. 2008).",

Schistosomiasis is a disease caused by parasitic worms (Schisotoma spp.) that spend part of their life cycle in freshwater snails and then leave the snails to penetrate the skin of people who enter contaminated water. The disease can damage liver, lungs, intestines, and bladder and infects roughly 200 million people. Deforestation changes the ecology of freshwater snail populations by increasing sunlight penetration, encouraging growth of vegetation, and changing water levels and flow rates. Many snail species do not survive these changes, but those which do tend to be better hosts for the parasitic worms (schistosomes) that cause this disease (Molyneux et al. 2008). In Cameroon, the upsurge in schistosomiasis following deforestation has been well described. Deforestation there led to the displacement of one type of freshwater snail, Bulinus forskalii, by another, Bulinus truncatus, better suited to cleared habitats. While B. forskalii hosted a type of schistosome that causes little illness in humans, B. truncatus is an effective host for Schistosoma haematobium, a primary cause of urinary tract Schistosomiasis (Southgate et al. 1976).",

This \u201cnatural\u201d contamination is thought to be caused by the release of mercury from burned trees and shrubs and increased soil erosion.

In Trinidad, in the 1940s, the development of cacao plantations caused a major malaria epidemic. The mechanism driving this epidemic was the use of anagroforestry system where species of the Erythrina tree were used to provide shade and nitrogen to the cacao. However, the shade provided by the Erythrina trees also provided ideal habitat for epiphytic bromeliads which, in turn, created excellent breeding sites for A. bellator, the principal local malaria vector. The epidemic was not controlled until the Erythrina trees were reduced in number and plantation techniques were changed (Downs and Pittendrigh 1946; Yasuoka and Levins 2007). This example also serves to show the complexity of managing ecological relationships: agroforestry systems, such as the Erythina and cacao systems described above, have largely been promoted for their contribution to biodiversity conservation, soil conservation, and carbon sequestration functions amongst others, yet, these case studies demonstrate that there also can be unforeseen health consequences associated with these practices. Thus, conserving and managing a multi-functional landscape will require knowledge of the tradeoffs and synergies among ecosystem services and will require adaptive management to respond to unforeseen consequences resulting from land use decisions.",

In Cote d\u2019Ivoire, cultivation of coffee and cacao plantations has been associated with exposure to African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness). The plantations create habitat for the tsetse fly vector and cause exposure by bringing agricultural workers into contact with the vector (Fournet et al. 2000). In a final example, the drainage and cultivation of papyrus swamps in highland Uganda appears to increase the risk of malaria. Households located near drained and cultivated swamps have higher ambient temperatures and more A. gambiae mosquitoes per household than households in villages surrounding undisturbed papyrus swamps (Lindblade et al. 2000).

The outbreak followed a period of heavy rainfall and runoff that contaminated Milwaukee\u2019s water supply despite new filtration and disinfection facilities and killed 54 people (Mac Kenzie et al. 1994). Heavy rainfall and runoff has been associated with other cryptosporidiosis outbreaks. Cryptosporidium oocysts are shed in the feces of many animals including ruminants like cows and sheep. They are very small (roughly 3 \u03bcm), pervasive, and are not easily filtered from water. Investigators found that 64% of farms in Pennsylvania had at least one cow infected with Cryptosporidium and on 44% of the farms, all bovine stool samples were positive. On these farms, the cattle had full access to waterways that could be contaminated by their feces (Graczyk et al. 2000).

Overall, human activity, adds at least as much fixed nitrogen to the terrestrial environment as all natural sources combined (Vitousek and Mooney 1997). Because fixed nitrogen is a critical and rate-limiting nutrient in many ecosystems, its widespread addition has profound impacts on these systems. In marine and freshwater environments, nutrient enrichment is responsible for a rapidly increasing number of harmful algal blooms. These blooms are caused by a wide variety of algae, causing massive fish kills, shellfish poisonings, disease and death of marine mammals, and human morbidity and mortality. In the United States alone, roughly 60,000 individual cases and clusters of human intoxication caused by algal blooms occur annually. Health impacts range from acute neurotoxic disorders and death to subacute and chronic disease. The cost of HABs in the US over a 15-year period was estimated to exceed $400 million (2001). Nutrient enrichment of coastal waters is also likely to play a role in cholera outbreaks. Plankton blooms stimulated by warm temperatures and increased nutrient levels help to transform the cholera bacteria, Vibrio cholera, from a quiescent to an infectious state (Ezzell 1999; Colwell and Huq 2001). Unfortunately, this problem is likely to increase since agricultural ecologists anticipate a global increase in nitrogen and phosphorus application of roughly 250% from current levels in order to meet projected food demand by 2050 (Tilman 2001).",

A recent review of the literature included 34 studies involving 41 different species of pathogens on 6 continents. The authors concluded that in 95% of observations (51 of 55), nutrient enrichment increased exposure to pathogens (McKenzie and Townsend 2007). In India, for example, extensive use of synthetic fertilizers in rice fields has been associated with increased exposure to Japanese encephalitis. Elevated nitrogen in these rice fields is associated with increases in the density of mosquito larvae, presumably because of increased growth of the microorganisms which are the primary food source for these larvae (Victor and Reuben 2000; Sunish and Reuben 2001). Similar associations between nutrient loading of surface water and increased concentrations of mosquito larvae have been shown for malaria vectors in Mexico (Rejmankova et al. 1991), Belize (Rejmankova et al. 2006) and Taiwan (Teng et al. 1998) and for Culex and Aedes species of mosquito which transmit La Crosse encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis and West Nile virus (Walker et al. 1991; Sunish and Reuben 2001). As with deforestation, this is a rich field for future research given the pervasiveness of nutrient loading, the importance of the diseases likely to be impacted, and the fact that most of these relationships have not yet been described.",

Both O3 and nitrogen oxides contribute to respiratory disease (both chronic and acute) and cardiovascular disease. In addition, agricultural application of nitrogen to land surfaces leads to contamination of groundwater with nitrates. The World Health Organization (WHO) maximum standard of nitrate in safe drinking water is 10 ppm. Globally, this standard is often exceeded. Even in the USA where strict drinking water legislation applies, 10\u201320% of groundwater sources may exceed 10 ppm.

In these cases, the mechanism for altered infectious disease exposure is often genetic change in pathogens resulting from a variety of livestock management practices. The widespread use of antibiotics for livestock has contributed to rapidly increasing microbial resistance. Resistant strains of Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Escherichia coli which can cause serious human infections have all been traced to the use of antibiotics in intensive livestock agriculture (Patz and Confalonieri 2005). A variety of other emerging or resurging infectious diseases are associated with livestock management practices as well. Pandemic influenza in humans is thought to result from genetic exchange among the strains of influenza virus in wild and domestic birds, and pigs. Close confinement of these animals in proximity to each other, for example in Asian \u201cwet markets,\u201d and in pig-duck farms in China, fosters this type of genetic exchange (Daily and Ehrlich 1996). The SARS epidemic is likely to have resulted from similar crowding of animals in live-animal markets in China. In this case, the species at the center of the epidemic were horseshoe bats and palm civet cats as amplifying hosts with a possible role for raccoon dogs, and Chinese ferret badgers as well. Most of the early cases of SARS were among people who worked with the sale or handling of these animals (Shi and Hu 2008).",

As they spread throughout the region, they shed schistosome eggs into waterways where they infect snails that serve as the intermediate host.

In India, there was a surge of \u201cirrigation malaria\u201d in the 1990s after poorly evaluated irrigation projects improved breeding conditions for the dominant malaria vector, Anopheles culcifacies. Malaria became endemic and widespread in a population of roughly 200 million people as a result (Sharma 1996). In general, dams and irrigation projects constructed in endemic areas tend to increase breeding habitat and transmission of malaria (World Commission on Dams 2000; Keiser et al. 2005). Agricultural projects that combine deforestation with dams and irrigation can be a particularly potent combination for increasing malaria exposure given their combined effects on breeding habitat and microclimate.",

In Ghana, a different vector is primarily responsible for transmission of filariasis, Anopheles gambiae. However, similar dynamics are observed.

In Lower Egypt, intestinal schistosomiasis rose to an even greater extent (Malek 1975; Cline et al. 1989; Molyneux et al. 2008). In the Tana river region of Kenya, the Hola irrigation project led to the introduction of snail vectors where they had never been before.

Around the world, the rapid proliferation of dams and irrigation projects has generated new habitat for freshwater snails well adapted to these environments and to hosting schistosomes resulting in a global surge in schistosomiasis infection. Propagation of Rift Valley Fever, leishmaniasis, dracunculosis, onchocerciasis, and Japanese encephalitis has also been associated with these projects (Jobin 1999; Patz and Confalonieri 2005).",

As with deforestation, agriculture, dams and irrigation systems, urbanization creates new habitat for disease hosts and vectors while changing human exposure patterns. Much of the rapid urbanization occurring today is taking place in urban or periurban slums with few services for clean water provision, sewage disposal, solid waste management, or quality housing. Pools of contaminated water, water containers kept in homes, tires and other refuse capable of holding water, and piles of municipal waste all create excellent habitat for a variety of rodent hosts and arthropod vectors, particularly those which transmit dengue, malaria, filariasis, Chagas disease, plague, and typhus. In addition, rural to urban migration brings people from different disease endemic regions together in high density providing a source for new infection as well as non-immune hosts. A final contributing factor to the spread of vector-borne disease in slums is the poor quality housing which does not provide an effective barrier to mosquitoes, rodents, or fleas.",

Over recent decades there has been a tremendous surge in dengue cases as it has spread out of South-east Asia and the Pacific and become endemic throughout the tropics. Dengue is the most common mosquito-borne viral disease in the world with roughly 50 million cases in over 100 countries each year (2008a). It is transmitted by the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes, primarily Aedes aegypti. These mosquitoes prefer to feed on humans over other animals and usually live close to human dwellings. They breed in man-made containers like earthenware jugs, tires, metal drums, discarded plastic food containers, and other items that collect rainwater. These characteristics make them highly effective at adapting to urban areas (Daily and Ehrlich 1996; Mackenzie et al. 2004). Relatively simple, ecologically based solutions, such as eliminating rainwater holding containers that serve as the breeding habitat for this species have proven effective control measures.",

Current projections are that, if efforts to provide water and sanitation to the underserved continue at the current rate, more than 692 million people will live without basic sanitation and 240 million without improved sources of drinking water, in urban areas in 2015 (Norstrom 2007). Particularly in crowded urban conditions, the exposure to infectious disease resulting from both contaminated drinking water and inadequate sanitation is significant. Diarrhea alone, caused primarily by contaminated drinking water, causes around 2.2 million deaths each year, about 4% of all global mortality. Poor sanitation can also lead to outbreaks of leptospirosis as was observed in San Salvador between March and November of 1996, where investigators identified over 300 cases of leptospirosis\u2014a disease that is transmitted by direct exposure to rodents or an environment contaminated by their urine. They found the highest incidence rates among the urban poor where exposure to rats and to flood waters contaminated by rat urine was likely to be highest. The disease had a 15% case fatality rate. Investigators noted an epidemiological shift in leptospirosis transmission from rural to urban areas and postulated that urban slums with large rodent populations create an environment in which heavy rains, which can drive rodents out of burrows and lead to contaminated flood waters, will trigger these epidemics (Ko et al. 1999).",

Wastewater from cities is often poorly treated and can expose downstream communities to infectious disease. It can also lead to outbreaks of harmful algal blooms and shellfish poisoning as it contaminates coastal marine environments (Rose et al. 2001). Urban emissions contribute to local air pollution but also have impacts regionally (acid rain, for example) and globally (climate change). Air pollution, primarily from urban centers in Asia, is causing the formation of atmospheric brown clouds which have become so extensive that they are impacting regional weather patterns, reducing agricultural productivity, and increasing glacial melting in addition to causing extensive deaths from cardiorespiratory disease (Ramanathan et al. 2008). Urban demand for food, building materials, fiber, and other ecosystem services drives many of the land use trends discussed earlier. Whether these demands are reduced by concentrating people in urban environments and creating efficiencies of scale or increased because of transportation requirements and waste has not been well studied.",

They have led to changes in the genetics, and thereby, the virulence, and infectiousness of pathogens. They have also changed the lifecycle of pathogens and vectors and the species composition of whole communities of disease-relevant organisms.
