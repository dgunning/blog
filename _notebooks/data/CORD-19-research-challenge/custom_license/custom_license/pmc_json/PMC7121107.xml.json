BACs are synthetic low-copy-number plasmids based on the well-characterized E. coli F-factor (12) that presents a strictly controlled replication leading to one or two plasmid copies per cell. These plasmids allow the stable maintenance of large DNA fragments in bacteria, minimize the toxicity problem usually observed with several CoV sequences when amplified in high-copy-number plasmids, and their manipulation is similar to that of conventional plasmids. The cDNA of the CoV genome is assembled in the BAC under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early promoter to allow the expression of the viral RNA in the nucleus by the cellular RNA polymerase II (13). At the 3\u2032-end, this cDNA is flanked by a 25-bp synthetic poly(A) and the sequences of the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme and the bovine growth hormone (BGH) termination and polyadenylation signals to produce synthetic RNAs bearing authentic 3\u2032-ends. This system allows the recovery of infectious virus from the cDNA clone without the need of in vitro ligation and transcription steps.\n\n",

These efficiencies are easily obtained by the electroporation method, which is more reproducible and efficient than the chemical methods. Here we describe the protocol for preparing electrocompetent DH10B cells from 1 liter of bacterial culture. All the steps of this protocol should be carried out under sterile conditions.\nInoculate a single colony of DH10B cells from a freshly streaked LB agar plate into a flask containing 10 ml of SOB medium. Incubate the culture overnight at 37\u00b0C with vigorous shaking (250 rpm).Inoculate two aliquots of 500 ml of prewarmed SOB medium with 0.5 ml of the overnight culture in separate 2-liter flasks. Incubate the flasks at 37\u00b0C with vigorous shaking (250 rpm) until the OD at 550 nm reaches 0.7 (this can take 4\u20135 h) (see\nNote 13).Transfer the flasks to an ice-water bath for about 20 min. Swirl the culture occasionally to ensure that cooling occurs evenly. From this point on, it is crucial that the temperature of the bacteria not rise above 4\u00b0C.Transfer the cultures to two ice-cold 500-ml centrifuge bottles and harvest the cells by centrifugation at 6000 \u00d7g (6000  rpm in a Sorvall GS3 rotor) for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. Discard the supernatant and resuspend each cell pellet in 500 ml of ice-cold 10% glycerol in sterile water.Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 6000 \u00d7g (6000 rpm in a Sorvall GS3 rotor) for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. Carefully pour off the supernatant and resuspend each cell pellet in 250 ml of ice-cold 10% glycerol (see\nNote 14).Repeat step 5 reducing the resuspension volume to 125 ml for each cell pellet.Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 6000 \u00d7g (6000 rpm in a Sorvall GS3 rotor) for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. Carefully pour off the supernatant (see\nNote 14) and remove any remaining drops of buffer using a Pasteur pipette attached to a vacuum line.Resuspend the cells in a final volume of 3 ml of ice-cold 10% glycerol, avoiding the generation of bubbles. This volume has been calculated to reach an optimal cell concentration of 2\u20134 \u00d71010 cells/ml.Transfer 50 \u03bcl of the suspension to an ice-cold electroporation cuvette (0.2-cm gap) and test whether arcing occurs when an electrical discharge is applied with the electroporation apparatus using the conditions described in Section 3.2.3.3, step 4. Arcing is usually manifested by the generation of a popping sound in the cuvette during the electrical pulse. If arcing occurs, wash the cell suspension once more with 100 ml of 10% glycerol and repeat steps 7 and 8.Dispense 100-\u03bcl aliquots of the final cell suspension into sterile, ice-cold 1.5-ml microfuge tubes, freeze quickly in a dry-ice methanol bath, and transfer to a \u201370\u00b0C freezer.

When the transfection efficiency of the susceptible cells is very low, we recommend first transfecting BHK-21 cells and then plating these cells over a monolayer of susceptible cells to allow virus propagation. BHK-21 cells are selected because they present good transfection efficiencies and support the replication of most known CoVs after transfection of the viral genome. The transfection of BACs containing large inserts into mammalian cells has been optimized in our laboratory. The best results were provided by the cationic lipid Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The following protocol is indicated for a 35-mm-diameter dish and can be up- or down-scaled if desired (see\nNote 24).\nOne day before transfection, plate 4 \u00d7105 BHK cells in 2 ml of growth medium without antibiotics to obtain 90\u201395% confluent cell monolayers by the time of transfection (see\nNote 25). Also plate susceptible cells (Vero E6 in the case of SARS-CoV) at the required confluence for the amplification of the recombinant virus after transfection.Before transfection, equilibrate the Opti-MEM I Reduced Serum Medium (GibcoBRL. Invitrogen) at room temperature and put the DNA (see\nNote 26) and the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent on ice. For each transfection sample, prepare transfection mixtures in sterile microfuge tubes as follows:\nDilute 5 \u03bcg of the BAC clone in 250 \u03bcl of Opti-MEM medium. Mix carefully, avoiding prolonged vortexing or pipetting to prevent plasmid shearing.Mix Lipofectamine 2000 gently before use. Dilute 12 \u03bcl of Lipofectamine 2000 in 250 \u03bcl of Opti-MEM medium, mix by vortexing, and incubate the diluted Lipofectamine 2000 at room temperature for 5 min.Combine the diluted DNA with diluted Lipofectamine 2000, mix carefully, and incubate for 20 min at room temperature.\nDuring this incubation period, wash the BHK-21 cells once with growth medium without antibiotics and leave the cells in 1 ml of the same medium per dish.Add the 500 \u03bcl of the DNA/Lipofectamine 2000 mixture onto the washed cells and mix by rocking the plate back and forth. Incubate the cells at 37\u00b0C for 6 h (see\nNote 27).Remove the transfection medium, wash the cells with trypsin-EDTA solution, and detach the cells using 300 \u03bcl of trypsin-EDTA solution. Add 700 \u03bcl of growth media to collect the cells and reseed them over a confluent monolayer of susceptible cells containing 1 ml of normal growth medium.Incubate at 37\u00b0C until a clear cytopathic effect is observed.Analyze the presence of virus in the supernatant by titration.Clone the virus and analyze the genotypic and phenotypic properties of the recovered virus.\n",

            "text": "\nE. coli DH10B strain is a recombination-defective strain used for the propagation of BACs to avoid unwanted rearrangements.SOB medium should be Mg2+-free to avoid arcing during the electroporation step.Vero E6 cells can yield up to 108 PFU/ml of SARS-CoV.The silent mutations introduced in the viral genome to generate new restriction sites can be used as genetic markers to identify the virus recovered from the infectious clone.To reduce the number of undesired mutations, perform all PCR reactions with a high-fidelity polymerase, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.The CMV promoter and the BGH termination and polyadenylation sequences can be amplified from pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Alternatively, these sequences together with the HDV ribozyme can be amplified from plasmid pBAC-TGEV 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 that is available from the authors upon request.In general, the cloning of CoV full-length cDNAs in BACs allows the stable propagation of the infectious clone in E. coli DH10B cells. If a residual toxicity, characterized by a small colony phenotype and a delay in the bacterial growth, is observed during the assembly of the infectious clone, we recommend inserting the cDNA fragment responsible for this toxicity in the last cloning step to minimize the toxicity problem. Additionally, the infectious clone can be stabilized by the insertion of a synthetic intron to disrupt the toxic region identified in the viral genome (14). The intron insertion site has to be precisely designed to generate 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 intron splice sites matching the consensus sequences of mammalian introns (15) and to restore the viral sequence after intron splicing during the translocation of the viral RNA expressed in the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm. The probability of splicing for every insertion site is estimated using the HSPL program, designed to predict splice sites in human DNA sequences (16).Cultures of BAC transformed bacteria should be grown from a single colony isolated from a freshly streaked selective plate. Subculturing directly from glycerol stocks or plates that have been stored for a long time may lead to loss of the construct.LB broth is the recommended culture medium, since richer broths such as TB (Terrific Broth) lead to extremely high cell densities, which can overload the purification system, resulting in lower yield and less purity of the BAC DNA.When other kits are used instead of the QIAprep Miniprep Kit (Qiagen), equivalent modifications have to be included to optimize the recovery of BAC DNA.To avoid DNA degradation and unwanted rearrangements owing to culture overaging, it is important to prevent the culture from growing up to the late stationary growth phase.The use of a swinging bucket rotor is recommended for the last isopropanol precipitation step to facilitate the further resuspension of the BAC DNA. After washing with 70% ethanol, air-dry the pellet for only 5 min. Never use vacuum, as overdrying the pellet will make the BAC DNA difficult to dissolve. Carefully remove any additional liquid drops, add 250 \u03bcl of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) (DNA dissolves better under slightly alkaline conditions), and resuspend the DNA overnight at 4\u00b0C. To prevent plasmid shearing, avoid vortexing or pipetting to promote resuspension of the BAC DNA. Transfer the DNA to a clean 1.5-ml microfuge tube, remove any possible resin traces by centrifugation for 1 min in a table-top microfuge, and keep the supernatant in a clean tube at 4\u00b0C. If the purified BAC DNA is not going to be used for a long period of time we recommend storage at \u201320\u00b0C. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles to prevent plasmid shearing.For efficient cell transformation, bacterial culture OD at 550 nm should not exceed 0.8. To ensure that the culture does not grow to a higher density, OD measurement every 20 min after 3 h of growth is highly recommended.Take care when decanting the supernatant as the bacterial pellets lose adherence in 10% glycerol.The Qiagen QIAEX II resin can be used to efficiently purify DNA fragments from 40 bp to 50 kb from aqueous solutions and from standard or low-melt agarose gels in TAE or TBE buffers. Other commercial kits are available, but check whether they have been optimized for purification of DNA fragments larger than 10 kb, as most BAC constructs used during the assembly of the infectious clone are larger than 10 kb.Ethidium bromide-DNA complex excitation by UV light may cause photobleaching of the dye and single-strand breaks. To minimize both effects, use a long-wavelength UV illumination (302 nm instead of 254 nm) to cut the desired DNA bands from the agarose gel.The large size of the BAC vectors reduces the ligation efficiency. To increase this efficiency, it is essential to use larger amounts of vector, insert, and T4 DNA ligase than when using conventional plasmids.Most electroporation machines contain programs with defined parameters for transforming specific cell types. In this case, choose the program containing the conditions closest to those described in this protocol.The presence of salt increases the conductivity of the solution and could cause arcing during the electrical pulse, drastically reducing the transformation efficiency. If arcing occurs, use a smaller amount of the ligation reaction in the electroporation or remove salt from the DNA using any commercial kit or by extraction with phenol:chloroform followed by precipitation with ethanol and 2 M ammonium acetate.Plating volumes higher than 200 \u03bcl of electroporated cells on a single plate may inhibit the growth of transformants owing to the large number of dead cells resulting from electroporation. If only small numbers of transformant colonies are expected, the recommendation is to spread 200 \u03bcl-aliquots of the electroporated cells on different plates.A mix of small and large colonies indicates that the cloned DNA fragment presents some toxicity when amplified in E. coli. Choose the small colonies, which may contain the correct insert, and always grow the bacteria containing this recombinant BAC plasmid at 30\u00b0C to minimize the toxicity problem. In this case, we strongly recommend inserting this toxic DNA fragment into the infectious clone in the last cloning step, in order to reduce the manipulation and minimize the possibility of introducing unwanted mutations. Infectious BAC cDNA clones presenting a residual toxicity should be grown at 30\u00b0C.It is important to avoid overloading the reaction by adding too many bacteria, which may alter the ionic balance of the reaction and inhibit the amplification by the Taq polymerase.We recommend using this storage method for BAC clones that present a residual toxicity and are not fully stable when amplified in E. coli.All work involving SARS-CoV has to be performed in a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) laboratory, following the guidelines of the European Commission and the National Institutes of Health.Do not add antibiotics to media during transfection as this causes cell death. A healthy cell culture is critical for an efficient transfection. The use of low-passage-number cells is recommended.Use a BAC DNA isolated with the Qiagen Large-Construct Kit since a DNA preparation of high purity is required in the transfection step.If susceptible cells are directly transfected, incubate them at 37\u00b0C until the cytopathic effect is observed and proceed to clone and characterize the recovered virus. In this case, optimization of the transfection of the desired cells with the BAC clone using Lipofectamine 2000 should be required. For transfection optimization, use a similar size plasmid expressing GFP. This plasmid is available from the authors upon request.\n",
