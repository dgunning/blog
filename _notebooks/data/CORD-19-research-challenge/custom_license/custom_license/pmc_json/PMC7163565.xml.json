            "text": "The preeminent goal of the immune system is to eliminate pathogens and establish immunological memory 1. Both T cells and Ab participate in eliminating a variety of pathogens; however, sustained serum Ab is an important criteria for many vaccination strategies, as they provide the first line of defense against re\u2010infection 2. Upon Ag encounter in regional lymph nodes, B cells undergo clonal expansion in extrafollicular foci and within germinal centers 3, 4. Rapidly activated B cells secrete low\u2010affinity Ab but can undergo isotype switching and limited BCR hypermutation as they differentiate into plasmablasts 3. In the milieu of accessory cells and cytokines, germinal center B cells undergo affinity maturation and ultimately differentiate into both Ab\u2010secreting cells (ASC) and memory B cells. As Ag is depleted, ASC and memory B cells are detected with increasing frequency in BM 2, where both stromal cells and other resident cells provide soluble as well as contact\u2010dependent survival signals, including CXCL12 and BAFF 5. Ab secretion by terminally differentiated plasma cells is independent of both Ag and T cell regulation 2, 6. Long\u2010lived ASC in BM and spleen maintain serum Ab, thus providing protective immunity to re\u2010infection, sometimes for the life time of the host 2. Upon re\u2010infection memory B cells rapidly expand and differentiate into plasmablasts, constituting a crucial source to increase pathogen\u2010specific Ab and replenish ASC 4, 6.",

            "text": "In contrast to Ag encountered in the periphery, the regulation of B cell activation by Ag sequestered within the central nervous system (CNS) is less clear. The absence of dedicated lymphatic drainage and the presence of the blood brain barrier (BBB) limits Ag transport from the CNS into secondary lymphoid tissue as well as trafficking of both cells and macromolecules into the CNS. In addition, CNS resident cells do not express MHC molecules 7\u20139; therefore, in the absence of inflammation, there is little possibility for endogenous Ag presentation, consistent with the inability to initiate immune responses within the CNS 10. Nevertheless, Ag deposition into the CNS, under conditions in which the BBB integrity remains relatively intact, results in a robust local humoral immune response 11. In situ ASC differentiation at the site of Ag deposition is preceded by peripheral activation, as implied by the early detection of Ag\u2010specific ASC in cervical lymph nodes (CLN) and spleen and the necessity of CLN for intrathecal Ab production 11. These data suggest that an Ag depot within the CNS is recognized as non\u2010self and that functions associated with peripheral B cell differentiation are sustained within the CNS. A variety of CNS inflammatory diseases support trafficking and preferential retention of ASC within the CNS. During virus\u2010induced encephalitis, B cells as well as virus\u2010specific ASC and ASC of unknown specificities are found in the inflamed CNS 12\u201316. Indirect evidence for intrathecal Ab synthesis includes oligoclonal Ab bands with restricted specificities in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) and multiple sclerosis (MS) 14, 17, 18. Increased CSF to serum Ab ratios detected following a variety of experimental CNS viral infections and measles virus\u2010induced encephalitis in humans further support local Ab production 15, 19, 20. Similarly, during acute MS the BBB is compromised, potentially allowing ASC recruitment 21, 22. Only a small portion of the oligoclonal bands in MS CSF are specific for a defined Ag 18, 23, 24, while the oligoclonal Ab bands in the CSF of SSPE patients are specific for measles virus 19, 20. These data suggest that B cells are recruited into the CNS during acute peripheral infections with neurological involvement as well as during loss of BBB integrity associated with autoimmunity. They also imply that the CNS provides a milieu capable of differentiating and maintaining ASC. Although chemokines and survival factors that influence preferential localization of ASC to the BM have recently been defined 5, 6, 15, relatively little is known about mechanisms sustaining ASC within the CNS.",

Despite rapid recruitment of B cells into the CNS following JHMV infection, serum Ab is detected only after the majority of infectious virus has been eliminated 16. The concept that humoral immunity is redundant during acute infection is supported by unimpaired initial clearance of infectious virus from the CNS of mice lacking the ability to secrete Ab 28, 29 and the absence of anti\u2010viral ASC in the CNS of WT mice until after virus clearance 16. However, a local Ab response within the CNS is required to control viral persistence 29.",

Stable levels of anti\u2010viral serum Ab suggest ASC in the BM as a primary source throughout persistence. However, virus\u2010specific ASC were preferentially retained within the CNS and were barely detectable in BM throughout persistent infection of the CNS by JHMV, in contrast to preferential accumulation in BM observed for heterologous peripheral infections 2, 31\u201333. High levels of virus\u2010induced CXCL9 and CXCL10 mRNA within the CNS implicate CXCR3 ligands as mediators of ASC recruitment. Furthermore, BAFF mRNA up\u2010regulation preceded ASC accumulation and remained detectable throughout ASC persistence. These data suggest that virus\u2010induced CNS inflammation creates an environment that sustains local ASC, preenpting accumulation in the BM as a homeostatic maintenance site.",

To ensure that an infection confined to the CNS induces continued Ab production similar to peripheral Ag encounter 2, 31, sera were examined for anti\u2010viral Ab. Virus\u2010specific IgM was initially detected at day 7 post\u2010infection (p.i.), while anti\u2010viral IgG was first detected slightly delayed at day 10 p.i. (Fig. 1A). Both reached maximum levels prior to the peak of neutralizing Ab and remained elevated (Fig. 1). Neutralizing Ab was initially detected at day 10 p.i. (Fig. 1B), consistent with previous results 16, increased further until day 45 p.i. and then remained stable until day 90 p.i. (Fig. 1B). The kinetics as well as retention of both neutralizing and isotype\u2010specific Ab in serum were similar in infected BALB/c (H\u20102d) and C57BL/6 (H\u20102b) mice (data not shown), demonstrating the absence of a strain\u2010dependent difference in the mouse haplotypes most commonly used to examine mouse hepatitis virus pathogenesis. Neutralizing as well as IgG and IgM serum Ab are thus sustained at constant levels following control of virus replication in the CNS.",

Sustained detection of serum JHMV\u2010specific IgM and IgG after clearance of infectious virus from the CNS thus suggested continued Ig secretion by virus\u2010specific ASC in BM or spleen. To examine potential contribution(s) of lymphoid organ\u2010derived ASC in maintaining serum Ab levels following CNS infection, JHMV\u2010specific ASC frequencies were examined longitudinally in spleen and BM. As ASC frequencies decline rapidly in CLN after day 15 p.i. 16, maintenance in this compartment was not pursued. ASC frequencies in spleen were already low at day 21 p.i., with similar frequencies of virus\u2010specific IgM and IgG ASC (Fig. 2A), consistent with the decline after day 10 p.i. 16. Splenic IgG ASC further declined gradually with time p.i. but remained detectable. In contrast, the complete disappearance of IgM ASC by day 45 p.i. suggests distinct trafficking, differentiation and/or survival of IgM versus IgG ASC (Fig. 2A). IgG\u2010secreting ASC in BM were barely detectable at day 21 p.i., whereas IgM ASC were not detected until day 45 p.i. (Fig. 2B). The frequency of ASC in BM increased very slowly with time, implying ongoing recruitment and/or continued differentiation of memory B cells or plasmablasts. However, even at day 90 p.i., only a minimal frequency of ASC was detected in BM. These data suggest that only a small population of virus\u2010specific ASC in peripheral organs contribute to sustained serum anti\u2010viral Ab levels.",

To determine the fate of ASC during persistence, virus\u2010specific ASC frequencies within the CNS were monitored longitudinally. Both IgG and IgM virus\u2010specific ASC in the CNS declined steadily after the peak at day 21 p.i. (Fig. 3). IgG ASC in the CNS declined to approximately 50% by day 60 p.i., and a further 50% loss occurred between days 60 and 90 after infection.

The respective areas were confirmed as demyelinated by staining adjacent serial sections with luxol fast blue (data not shown).

Data derived from experiments depicted in Fig. 2 and 3 were converted to ASC per tissue to account for overall higher numbers of lymphocytes in spleen and BM compared to the CNS. Vastly higher numbers of ASC were detected within the CNS compared to BM and spleen at day 21 p.i., irrespective of isotype (Fig. 5A, B), suggesting preferential trafficking of pre\u2010plasma cells into the CNS and/or more rapid local differentiation 11. On a total tissue basis, IgG ASC numbers progressively declined within the CNS, remained relatively constant in spleen and slowly increased in BM, eventually reaching numbers equivalent to spleen at days 40\u201360 p.i. (Fig. 5A). Slightly different dynamics were observed between days 60 and 90 p.i., when numbers continued to decline in spleen and CNS but increased in BM (Fig. 5A, B). The continued decline of CNS IgG ASC by day 90 p.i. eventually resulted in an equal distribution of total IgG ASC in CNS and BM (Fig. 5A). Although IgM ASC were not detected in BM at day 21 p.i. (Fig. 5B), they ultimately increased, reaching numbers similar to the CNS by day 90 p.i. (Fig. 5B). As terminally differentiated ASC are sessile 4, 5, these dynamics presumably reflect progressive loss of survival factors within the CNS but continued differentiation of ASC within the BM, rather than redistribution from the CNS to the BM. However, the vastly greater virus\u2010specific ASC frequencies and numbers per organ imply enhanced recruitment/survival factors within the CNS compared to peripheral lymphoid compartments following the resolution of encephalitis (Fig. 2, 4, 5). Consistent with enhanced recruitment/survival within the CNS, increased virus\u2010specific IgG plaque diameter with time p.i. suggests ASC maturation 38.

Plasma cells furthermore lose class II expression through transcriptional repression of the class II transcriptional activator CIITA 4. Flow cytometric analysis of CD45hi brain infiltrates indicated a prominent increase of CD138+ cells between days 14 and 21 p.i.

Although their percentage was low, CD138+ cells increased in frequency by day 70 p.i. (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, whereas the majority of CD138+ cells expressed class II early during persistence, class II\u2013 cells dominated later. CD138+class II\u2013 cells were even more abundant in spinal cords, the predominant site of persistence and demyelination 39, by day 70 p.i. (Fig. 6B).

Transient responsiveness to the CXCR3 ligands CXCL9, 10 and 11 has also been shown to mediate plasmablast migration in vitro\n40. JHMV infection induces CNS expression of both CXCL9 and CXCL10 within 3 days p.i. 43, potentially supporting recruitment of ASC. During CNS autoimmune disease, ASC accumulation is associated with expression of CXCL13, a ligand involved in B cell migration toward follicular DC, and expression of BAFF, a B cell and ASC survival factor 42, 44, 45. Expression of mRNA for the chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL13 as well as BAFF was thus analyzed during acute replication and the persistent phase (Table 1). CXCL9 and CXCL10 mRNA were most prominent between days 8 and 14 p.i. and decreased substantially following clearance of infectious virus, confirming previous results 43. The lack of CXCL13 mRNA expression implies the absence of follicular DC involvement and local lymphoid follicle formation 44. BAFF mRNA levels peaked delayed compared to the CXCR3 ligands but preceded peak ASC accumulation (Table 1). Although BAFF mRNA decreased slowly after day 21 p.i., levels were still elevated 5\u2010fold over naive levels 75 days after infection. Thus, maximum BAFF mRNA levels preceded peak accumulation of virus\u2010specific ASC and declined with similar kinetics as ASC during viral persistence. These data suggest that CXCL9 and CXCL10 function as recruitment cytokines and that BAFF constitutes a potential survival factor for ASC within the brain.",

Frequencies as well as total numbers of virus\u2010specific IgG and IgM ASC were combined to facilitate comparison of CNS\u2010restricted (Fig. 7A) and transient peripheral (Fig. 7B) viral infection. In contrast to the low frequencies of total virus\u2010specific ASC in spleen and BM following CNS infection, peripheral infection resulted in substantially increased frequencies in the spleen as well as BM (Fig. 7B). No ASC were detected in the CNS following peripheral infection, suggesting that in contrast to activated T cells 46, activated B cells do not traffic into the CNS. Differences in ASC distribution were even more dramatic at the level of total number per tissue. Contrasting with the CNS infection (Fig. 7C), the vast majority of virus\u2010specific ASC localized to the spleen following peripheral infection (Fig. 7D). Although total numbers of virus\u2010specific ASC in BM of peripherally infected mice were lower than in spleen (Fig. 7D), ASC numbers in BM still exceeded those in the CNS of infected mice (Fig. 7B), suggesting no inherent defect in trafficking to BM. The overall paucity of peripheral ASC following CNS infection is consistent with limited viral Ag in lymphoid tissues and rapid recruitment into the CNS. Furthermore, enhanced virus\u2010specific ASC elicited by peripheral viral infection presumably reflect higher viral Ag load. Nevertheless, the preferential retention of ASC in spleen following a peripheral infection contrasts with the distribution of ASC following immunization with inert Ag and either systemic or respiratory viral infections 2, 31, 47.",

The subsequent relative increase in CD138+ cells and gradual loss of class II expression during the persistent state suggest ongoing local differentiation within the CNS and/or preferential survival of a more differentiated phenotype 21. The former notion is supported by a substantially increased proportion of class II\u2013CD138+ cells in spinal cords compared to brains at day 70 p.i. as well as increased spot size of ASC derived from brains at late compared to early times p.i.

Intrathecal Ab secretion is associated with a variety of CNS infectious and autoimmune diseases and involves responses to self Ag as well as persisting microbial Ag 14, 51\u201353. Although a small frequency of oligoclonal Ab in the CSF of MS patients are specific for Ag associated with viral infections acquired as young adults, the majority have as\u2010yet\u2010undefined specificities 18. These data suggest that ASC can be retained within the human CNS for prolonged periods in the apparent absence of microbial Ag. However, a confounding issue is the role of self Ag in potentially propagating novel ASC subpopulations during chronic inflammation 23, 44. During JHMV infection, virus\u2010specific T cells decline rapidly as viral replication is controlled and Ag diminishes; nevertheless, T cell retention is prolonged in the continued presence of viral Ag/RNA 39. In contrast, virus\u2010specific ASC only reach peak levels after viral Ag is reduced to barely detectable levels and infectious virus is below detection limits. Their frequencies and total numbers subsequently also decline, albeit at a much reduced rate compared to T cells. These data imply distinct and largely Ag\u2010independent ASC survival signals. Up\u2010regulation of BAFF mRNA prior to peak ASC accumulation and a gradual concomitant decrease in BAFF mRNA levels and ASC after day 21 p.i. support BAFF as a likely candidate molecule required for ASC survival in the CNS 42, 44, 45. Furthermore, the inability to detect CXCL13 weakens the concept of a potential role for local follicle formation in supporting de novo ASC generation, in contrast to involvement of this mechanism during chronic autoimmune disease 44. In addition, ASC of multiple isotypes are retained within the CNS for prolonged periods following CNS JHMV infection 16. Retention of IgM ASC in the CNS, persisting serum IgM and gradual accumulation in BM suggest a potential role for IgM in control of JHMV persistence, similar to other viral infections 48. Irrespective of unique isotype patterns induced by distinct CNS infections, all isotypes can be sustained within the CNS 13. Retention thus appears dependent upon the host's response to the virus itself and not a generalized response to CNS inflammation.",

However, in contrast to systemic infections, in which a decline in splenic ASC numbers is counterbalanced by an increase in BM ASC, few ASC ever appear in the BM following JHMV infection. Preferential CNS retention, concomitant with poor BM accumulation, appears unique compared to localized infections of lung or intestinal tract 31, 33 and may reflect the primary role of intrathecal Ab in controlling viral persistence 13, 15, 16. A prominent intrathecal Ab response to JHMV infection is supported by increased CFS to serum ratios of virus\u2010specific antibodies in rats and mice 36. In extreme cases, some animals only exhibited viral Ab in CSF and not in the corresponding serum 36. Extremely limited ASC localization to BM suggests that ASC are diverted from a default trafficking pathway into the BM characteristic of peripheral infections 2. Our data suggest that strong induction of both CXCL9 and CXCL10 within the CNS during acute infection mediates recruitment of CXCR3\u2010expressing plasmablasts. Continued expression of these chemokines as virus is cleared may sustain ongoing recruitment as ASC continue to emerge from lymphoid organs. The elevated level of BAFF mRNA within the CNS supports induction of factors necessary for prolonged ASC survival 54. Furthermore, in contrast to ASC apoptosis within inflammatory lesions following virus clearance from peripheral tissues, few apoptotic cells are detected in the CNS 55, and ASC are retained in apparent preference to BM.",

Importantly, the paucity of ASC in BM suggests that differentiating ASC are diverted and migrate toward virus\u2010induced chemokines within the CNS. CXCL9 and CXCL10, early chemokines induced by JHMV 43, are maintained during peak ASC recruitment and support a role for CXCR3 ligands in ASC recruitment. CXCL12 and BAFF, which are constitutively expressed at high levels in BM, may be candidates facilitating ASC retention in the CNS 6. The recent discovery of BAFF up\u2010regulation in CNS plaques associated with MS and in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis 44, 45 provides a mechanism for the promotion of ASC survival during CNS autoimmune disease. Similarly, following CNS infection, BAFF was up\u2010regulated concurrently with viral clearance, and mRNA expression was maintained within the CNS throughout persistence. These data suggest that maintenance of ASC during chronic viral infections associated with limited ongoing inflammation may involve components similar to chronic inflammatory diseases, albeit with limited contribution of viral Ag.",
