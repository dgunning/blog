Recently, two novel polyomaviruses were detected from respiratory secretions. Allander et al. [3] discovered a previously unrecognized human polyomavirus in 6 (1%) of 637 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) and 1 (0.5%) of 192 fecal samples and proposed a new KI polyomavirus (KIPyV). The second newly identified polyomavirus was described by Gaynor et al. in respiratory samples from Brisbane, Australia, and St. Louis, USA. The authors amplified and cloned the genome of WU Polyomavirus (WUPyV) from NPA of a 3-year-old patient with pneumonia without detection of other respiratory pathogens. Screening of 2,135 patients with RTI yielded 43 additional positive patients [8]. Since the first description of KIPyV and WUPyV, a number of prevalence studies from various areas have been published, but until now, the clinical relevance for RTI in children remains an unresolved issue [1, 5, 10].",

PCR amplifications were performed in 50-\u03bcl reaction mixtures under the following conditions: 25 pmol of each primer, 200 \u03bcM each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 9.0), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, and 2.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Roche, Germany). Reactions were run in a Biometra T3000 thermocycler using a step cycle programme. After initial denaturation of DNA at 95\u00b0C for 3 min, 35 cycles were run: 95\u00b0C for 1 min, annealing temperature of 55\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min with a 5-min 72\u00b0C extension after the 35 cycles. A 10-\u03bcl aliquot from each reaction was run on a 2% NuSieve 3:1 electrophoresis-grade agarose gel (FMC Bioproducts, Rockland, Maine, USA) in 1\u00d7 TAE buffer (0.04 mol/l Tris acetate, 0.001 mol/l EDTA) with ethidium bromide (0.5 g/ml) to visualize the amplified PCR products under UV illumination.

At day 37 (May 2006), the patient displayed respiratory distress; a chest X-ray examination showed left-sided basal pneumonia. Antimicrobial treatment including antifungals was started. In addition, ganciclovir was added because of the detection of cytomegalovirus, EBV and HHV-6 in a bronchoalveolar lavage specimen. The number of copies in quantitative DNA testing was found to be very low for all of these pathogens. No other respiratory viruses were detected (except KIPyV, retrospectively).

This, on the one hand, may be due to the relatively low sensitivity of our methods, which detected only 105 copies per ml NPA, but on the other hand, may also be caused by the lack of KIPyV and WUPyV in our patient cohort. Prevalence studies of KIPyV and WUPyV reported a worldwide distribution, with an incidence for KIPyV of 1% in Sweden, 1.4% in the UK, 2% in Thailand and 2.6% in Australia [4, 6, 7, 12, 13]. The prevalence of WUPyV was highest, with 7%, in South Korea and 6.3% Thailand [9, 13]. From Australia, the US and the UK, a prevalence of 4.5, 1.2 and 1.0%, respectively, has been reported [6, 8, 12]. The age distribution of KIPyV- and WUPyV-infected patients showed two peaks, with the highest rates in children under 5 years and in patients older than 45 years [2, 11]. A seasonal variation of KIPyV and WUPyV has not been consistently demonstrated. Most infections with KIPyV were detected during the winter months in Thailand, but not in a study conducted in Australia. In Australia, the incidence of WUPyV infections showed the highest peak in December; this was not confirmed in a study from Thailand [6, 7, 13].",

High co-detection rates were found in Australia, with 75% for KIPyV, 80% for WUPyV; the most common co-pathogens were human rhinovirus and hBoV. Co-detection of KIPyV and WUPyV occurred in 14 patients, and only in one of these cases were no other respiratory virus present [6]. Norja et al. [12] detected KIPyV and WUPyV in 19 patients and viral co-infection in 10 patients, with predominant co-detection of adenovirus. The overall frequencies of detection of KIPyV and WUPyV were equal in patients with upper and lower respiratory tract infection, and in asymptomatic patients. Eight of the patients were immunocompromized [12].",

The clinical relevance of other viruses (CMV, EBV, HHV 6) co-detected in one severely immunocompromised patient in a bronchoalveolar lavage specimen is unclear. Nevertheless, coinfections still remain possible, as we were not able to test for all putative copathogens, and the amounts of viral nucleic acids present in the samples may have fallen below the detection limits for some pathogens. Hence, we carefully suggest that KIPyV and WUPyV are more than a viral colonization, with the limitation of our study being that we did not examine children without acute respiratory symptoms.",
