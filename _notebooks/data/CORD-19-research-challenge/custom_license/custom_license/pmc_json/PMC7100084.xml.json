The following 13 viruses and 5 bacterial pathogens could be detected from a single sample: enterovirus, influenza virus type A and type B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus type 1, type 2, type 3, and type 4, adenovirus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), coronavirus, reovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis, and Legionella pneumophila. M-RT-PCR-ELISA was performed weekdays, when a certain number of samples had accumulated and could be processed in one run. From sample collection to the final result of the m-RT-PCR-ELISA, it took in average 3 working days. RSV and influenza RADT (Certest Biotec S.L.) were performed as POC diagnostic for every patient during admission. The sensitivity for RSV is 95% and the specificity > 99%. These data are provided by the manufacturer and reflect the results of a comparison of Certest RADT to another RADT. An evaluation by PCR was not provided. The reference RADT has a pooled sensitivity of 81% and a pooled specificity of 97% evaluated by PCR and culture [16].",

            "text": "Taking all this into account, it is highly interesting why children presenting themselves with comparable symptoms are treated differently. Keeping in mind that a positive RSV-RADT led to the increased prescription of inhalation therapy, we assume that it might have also been related to a reduced rate of antibiotic treatment. A positive result of an RSV-RADT was associated significantly with reduced prescription of antibiotics with an OR of 0.73 (0.59\u20130.89). This is a clear reduction of the antibiotic prescription rate by a positive RSV-RADT. Practitioners seem to be more inclined to start a symptomatic therapy with inhalations and to refrain from antibiotic treatment, if clinical presentation of the patient and RADT both indicates RSV infection. Antibiotic therapy in RADT negative patients might be triggered by uncertainty of the etiology of the infection and not only by the severity of symptoms or laboratory findings.",

            "text": "Of course, antibiotic therapy might also be triggered by assumed bacterial coinfection, which is well described for RSV infection [32, 33]. For hMPV, only one study indicates that superinfection with S. pneumoniae can occur, since a pneumococcal vaccine reduced hospitalization of children with hMPV-associated pneumonia [34]. Bacterial coinfection, even in children presenting themselves with wheezing, has been estimated to range from 18 up to 55% [35\u201337]. However, it is not possible to draw a clear distinction between bacterial infection and colonization. Neither detection of bacterial pathogens and clinical and radiological signs of pneumonia, nor the decision for antibiotic treatment and positive bacterial cultures could be correlated positively to in other studies [36]. High serum levels of CRP (exceeding 40\u201360 mg/L) might indicate a bacterial infection [38]. In RSV infection, also lower concentrations of CRP can hint at bacterial coinfections, since RSV is known to suppress the production of proinflammatory proteins [36, 39]. A high viral load of RSV was associated with decreased CRP serum concentration [36]. hMPV lack these genes coding for proteins, which allow RSV to reduce the hosts immune response [8, 40]. In contrast, lower concentrations of interleukins were found in children infected with hMPV than in children suffering from RSV infection [41]. This underlines the challenges in decision-making concerning antibiotic treatment in children with respiratory tract infections. In our study, antibiotic treatment was likely triggered by elevated laboratory values indicating inflammation (e.g., CRP\u2014which was particularly pronounced in children with adenovirus infections), and/or by clinical symptoms often associated with bacterial infections, like crackles on auscultation. Crackles, regarded as hallmark of pneumonia, are found in hMPV and RSV infections in 35\u201338% [30].",

According to our data, children presenting themselves during winter season with RSV-like symptoms like cough, airway obstruction, and crackles on auscultation, age of 1 year and older, and a negative RSV-RADT qualify for a PCR-based point-of-care testing. Regarding Fig. 2 a cutoff at 12 months should allow to detect as many children as possible suffering from hMPV infection and those children false negative in RSV-RADT. This might lead to a reduction in antibiotic therapy. Possibly, a shorten length of antibiotic treatment and an improvement in rates of cross-infections during inpatient treatment can be achieved, as well.",
