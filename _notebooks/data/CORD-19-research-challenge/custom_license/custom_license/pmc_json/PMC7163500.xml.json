Normal nasal cytology samples in most species are of low cellularity and are comprised of squamous and ciliated columnar epithelial cells accompanied by epicellular and extracellular commensal bacteria, while nasal associated lymphoid tissue and mucus can also be present. Nasal disease is relatively common in domestic species and is often of either infectious (typically bacterial or fungal) or neoplastic origin. Bacterial rhinitis in dogs and cats is often secondary to the presence of other inflammatory/infectious disease or neoplasia, so superficial samples can be diagnostically misleading. In contrast, fungal rhinitis due to Aspergillus and Penicillium sp. in dogs or Cryptococcus sp. in cats can be primary, however, low numbers of fungal elements can be present in clinically normal dogs and cats (Fig. 1). Unique to horses are bacterial or fungal infections of the guttural pouches, which are paired, air\u2010filled, auditory tube diverticula connecting the nasopharynx to the middle ear and, when infected may present with purulent or bloody nasal discharge as the primary complaint. Because of their complex anatomy, which includes their juxtaposition to several cranial nerves and the internal and external carotid arteries, diseases of the guttural pouch, particularly those of bacterial and fungal origin, can result in significant neurologic dysfunction or fatal hemorrhage.1\n",

Overall, infectious pulmonary disease exhibits a similar spectrum of organisms as in people, with similar regional variation. In the Upper Mid\u2010West, pulmonary blastocymosis is an important cause of canine respiratory disease and dogs are monitored as a sentinel species for human infection, although infected dogs are not considered a zoonotic risk (Fig. 2). Pulmonary neoplasia, both primary and metastatic, is most common in dogs and cats and rare in the horse. Cytologic evaluation of either BAL or lung aspirates is capable of detecting multiple types of lung carcinoma, although tumor origin (primary vs. metastatic) or subtype cannot be distinguished cytologically. The lung can also be a primary site for hematopoietic neoplasia, including lymphoma and histiocytic sarcoma (Fig. 3).",

Cytology is accurate for the detection of the hepatocyte vacuolar changes that, while often nonspecific, can accompany certain endocrinopathies, including diabetes mellitus and hyperadrenocorticism. In the cat, marked lipid vacuolar change accompanied by suggestive serum biochemical abnormalities is highly diagnostic for feline hepatic lipidosis, a metabolic syndrome triggered by acute anorexia that can be idiopathic, stress\u2010induced, or secondary to other diseases (Fig. 6). For the diagnosis of hepatic neoplasia, cytology has moderate sensitivity but very good specificity and positive predictive value, including accurately classifying round cell tumors and hepatocellular and non\u2010hepatocellular carcinomas.3 In contrast, cytology has both low sensitivity and positive predictive value for inflammatory liver disease, in which case histopathology is recommended for definitive diagnosis.4 Despite the importance of pancreatitis in both dogs and cats, concerns about the safety of sampling that organ have delayed the validation of pancreatic cytology as a diagnostic tool. Several small studies and one larger one suggest cytologic sampling of the pancreas is a low\u2010risk procedure, which should promote further validation of this technique.5, 6\n",

With the possible exception of cryptococcosis, fungal infections of the CNS are uncommon in veterinary medicine. Cryptococcus is the most common fungal disease in cats and has a predilection for the CNS in both dogs and cats.41, 42, 43 CNS involvement with other fungal organisms is uncommon, although there are reports of brain and spinal cord infections in blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, coccidiomycosis, phaeohyphomycosis, aspergillosis, and fusariosis.41\n",

Abdominal and pleural fluids are most commonly submitted and thus will be the focus of this review, however synovial, cerebrospinal, and pericardial fluid analyses are also performed, particularly in referral practice settings. In healthy animals, there is very little fluid in the pleural space and abdominal cavity, with the exception of large animal species (e.g., the horse and cow), in which abdominal fluid can be readily collected from normal animals. Normal cavity fluids have very low protein content (\u22642.5 g dl\u22121), as well as low nucleated cell counts. In dogs and cats, nucleated cells should be <1,000 cells \u03bcl\u22121, however fluid from healthy horses can have up to 10,000 cells \u03bcl\u22121. Cytologically, mononuclear cells (mesotheial cells, lymphocytes, and mononuclear phagocytes) predominate in normal small animal body cavity fluid. In contrast, normal body cavity fluid in the horse can demonstrate more variability in nucleated cell differential, which can vary from mononuclear cell dominated to neutrophil dominated. Automated methods for cell counting have replaced manual ones, although microscopic differential cell counts remain the standard of care.44\n",

            "text": "Categorization of effusions in veterinary medicine follows the transudate, modified transudate, and exudate scheme with similar specific categories (i.e., chylous, neoplastic, hemorrhagic, bilious, etc).45 Sterile inflammatory exudates can be associated with pancreatitis in small animals, uroperitoneum, and bile peritonitis, the latter of which is most commonly seen in dogs. Cytologic evidence of bile is typically evident by the presence of yellow to green or blue/black pigment, however the presence of amorphous\u2010to\u2010fibrillar, basophilic mucinous material similar to \u201cwhite bile\u201d described in people can also be found in certain cases of canine bile peritonitis (Fig. 13).46 Horses do not have gall bladders, limiting the significance of this condition in those species. Hemorrhagic effusions may be seen in cases of trauma or coagulopathy, although in older dogs, particularly those of predisposed breeds (e.g., German shepherds, golden retrievers, and boxers), ruptured hemangiosarcoma of the spleen or liver is considered an important differential diagnosis. Feline infectious peritonitis is a lethal immune\u2010mediated disease associated with infection with a feline coronavirus.47 The \u201cwet\u201d or effusive form of the disease results in very high protein (>8.0 g dL\u22121), straw\u2010to\u2010golden colored, hazy abdominal or thoracic effusion with moderate numbers of nucleated cells of inconsistent distribution.47 In horses, abdominocentesis and cytologic fluid analysis are routinely performed as part of the diagnostic evaluation for any gastrointestinal disease (often generically referred to as \u201ccolic\u201d). Septic inflammation may be associated with rupture of the gastrointestinal tract, although in peracute cases, which may lack significant inflammation, cytologic distinction from inadvertent enterocentesis is vital.",

As noted above, flow cytometry and molecular diagnostics can be of value in low cellularity samples or when cytologic features are not compellingly diagnostic. Carcinomatosis can be difficult to distinguish from severe reactive mesothelial hyperplasia because of overlap in the degree of cytologic atypia.45 Mesothelioma has been reported in dogs, cats, and horses, but is rare and often cannot be reliably cytologically distinguished from carcinoma or severe mesothelial hyperplasia. Cytologically, owing to their morphologic overlap, it is often impossible to identify a tissue or origin (primary or metastatic) of a carcinoma cell population in a peritoneal or pleural fluid sample, with the potential exception of gastric squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in horses. Gastric SCC is the most common stomach tumor in horses and can exfoliate neoplastic squamous cells into cavity effusions through metastasis or erosion through the gastric wall.48\n",
