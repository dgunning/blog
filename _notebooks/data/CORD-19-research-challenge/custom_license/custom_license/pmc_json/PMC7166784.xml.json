A new human coronavirus\u2010HKU1 (HCoV\u2010HKU1) has been reported from a patient with pneumonia in Hong Kong.

HCoV is associated frequently with community acquired upper respiratory tract infections showing typical clinical symptoms including a runny nose, fever, coughing, and wheezing [Labret et al., 2005; Esper et al., 2006; Gose et al., 2011].

Chung et al. [2007] also tried to identify the virus in patients with acute expiratory wheezing in Korea but evidence of HCoV\u2010HKU1 infection was not found. These negative results arose from several limitations such as an insensitive diagnostic strategy, selection of samples out of season as well as the relatively small number of patients studied.

Unlikely, apparent lower incidence (0.3%, n = 4,181) of HCoV\u2010HKU1 in patients with acute respiratory tract in Hong Kong was reported by Lau et al. [2006]. Relatively high incidence of HCoV\u2010HKU1 in Korea might have resulted from difference of target study group and/or sensitivity of detection strategy. Even though the quantified viral loads varied from 6.7 \u00d7 104 to 1.6 \u00d7 109 copies/ml in the respiratory disease specimens used, there were no significant correlations between viral load and specific clinical features. Similarly, there were no statistically significant relationships between the HCoV\u2010HKU1 infection and any particular clinical symptoms. As for seasonal prevalence, the HCoV\u2010HKU1 infections prevailed in the winter and spring in Korea and this result was consistent with the infection rates of HCoV\u2010OC43, 229E and with other reports [Lau et al., 2006; Domiquez et al., 2009; Gaunt et al., 2010].

When single reciprocal nucleotide exchanges were analyzed between the RdRp, S, and N genes, no recombination could be identified. Instead, several point mutations were observed at the nucleotide level, resulting in a transition (C to T) or a transversion (C to T or T to C) in the RdRp, S, and N genes. However, these were silent mutations so that no changes occurred at the amino acid level. Interestingly, a silent continuous mutation in the N gene was identified from 6/8 isolates of HCoV\u2010HKU1 genotype B.
