The intertwining complexity of these pathogens with their diverse tissue tropisms, direct effects on host cells, multiphasic immunological responses, and additional influence of superimposed secondary agents is beyond the expertise of a single discipline in modern medicine. A combined evaluation of patient\u2019s history, clinical manifestations, and physical examination may suggest a list of differential diagnosis, but it is often insufficient to determine the specific infectious etiology. Laboratory methods are essential to identify an etiologic agent from testing clinical samples, such as blood, serum, nasopharyngeal swab, etc. These methods, including traditional microbiological techniques, conventional immunological assays, and modern molecular methods, remain the mainstay in today\u2019s practice of clinical microbiology and infectious disease medicine. Nevertheless, there are technical and logistic issues associated with these methods, and the test results often lack a clinicopathologic correlation that can confound the interpretation of their clinical significance. For example, microbiological culture may fail to grow a causative organism, while the organism isolated by the laboratory in vitro may arise from contamination and does not represent the actual infective agent in vivo.",

Pathologic examination, if available, can establish a more specific diagnosis correlated with clinical manifestations. Although general practice of pathology is largely oriented toward diagnosis of neoplastic diseases, pathologists have been increasingly called upon to make diagnoses from tissue samples collected by cytology, biopsy, and autopsy procedures in response to the challenge of emerging infections [1\u20134]. Using these tissue samples as the source for laboratory workup, pathologists have made various contributions to our understanding of emerging infectious diseases in diagnostics, pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical aspects of these diseases (Table 45.1). In addition, results from pathologic studies can help design better strategies for control and prevention of these emerging infectious diseases, especially when they occur as an outbreak [5, 6]. Furthermore, pathologic studies also play an essential role in identifying the effects of secondary pathogens that commonly complicate the primary disease syndrome [7, 8].\n",

            "text": "Recent advances in molecular biology have revolutionized the practice of medicine, especially in the arena of diagnostic pathology and laboratory medicine [9\u201311]. The practice of pathology has evolved from using morphologic pattern recognition as the main tool to a sophisticated medical subspecialty by applying a wide array of advanced immunologic and molecular techniques on top of the traditional methods. The so-called \u201ctraditional methods\u201d include routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain, histochemical (special) stain, and electron microscopy (EM). The more commonly used advanced techniques include immunohistochemistry (IHC), in situ hybridization (ISH), polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR), and tissue microarrays. Other advanced techniques that are less standardized as diagnostic utilities include confocal microscopy, proteomics, laser capture microdissection (LCM), and in situ PCR. The results from these techniques provide different information regarding the infectious agents in the organ systems they involve (Table 45.2). Each technique has its respective advantages and limitations, and there is no single technique that can stand alone as the only method for etiologic diagnosis. The advanced techniques complement the traditional methods to confirm the diagnosis; therefore, it is always necessary to apply these techniques as an integrated laboratory utility to take full advantage of the pathology approach. A good example to illustrate such approach is the identification of a novel coronavirus during the global epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 [12\u201317]. By using traditional culture (Fig. 45.1a) and EM examinations (Fig. 45.1b) on clinical samples and tissue specimens, the morphologic evidence of coronavirus leads to subsequent anatomic localization of this novel virus in lung tissues by using a combination of IHC (Fig. 45.1c), ISH (Fig. 45.1d), and PCR. Ultimately, correlations of these data with serological and clinical findings confirmed the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as the etiologic pathogen of the outbreak. This is a prime example of the contributions made by infectious disease pathology as part of a multidisciplinary approach to investigate emerging infections and disease outbreaks.\n\n",

It demonstrates the histologic and cytologic features in a tissue section and allows the pathologists to examine the microscopic changes related to infectious processes. This is the most unequivocal method to illustrate the evidence of a microbial infection and its consequence in the tissue. For example, the presence of abundant neutrophils in pulmonary alveoli is indicative of pneumonia (Fig. 45.2a), while neutrophils in meninges support the diagnosis of meningitis. However, these histopathologic findings shown by H&E stain are not specific because they can be caused by a variety of organisms; their importance is to pave the first step leading to further laboratory assays for detecting the causative agent.\n",

Some of the common ones are tissue Gram stain (for bacteria), Grocott\u2019s methenamine silver stain (for fungi), acid-fast stain (for mycobacteria), periodic acid-Schiff stain (for organisms with high content of carbohydrate macromolecules), Warthin\u2013Starry silver stain or Steiner\u2019s silver stain (for spirochetes and other bacteria). Interpretation of these special stains performed on tissue sections is usually more difficult than those performed on cultures because the coexistence of host tissue responses and accompanied histopathologic changes in the sections can confound the interpretation. It needs more expertise and effort to examine these special stains and usually requires a trained pathologist to carry out such examination. For example, Streptococcus pneumoniae can appear as gram-negative cocci in tissue sections because the host inflammatory responses, antibiotic treatment, or autolysin \u00adproduced by the bacteria per se can damage the bacterial cell wall and render the Gram stain appear negative. Even when these special stains properly highlight organisms of interest, they can only categorize them within a broad classification but not a specific species. For example, gram-positive cocci demonstrated by tissue Gram stain in a lung section (Fig. 45.2b) could represent different species of Streptococci or Staphylococci, and further testing with more specific assays is needed to reveal the true identity of these cocci.",

            "text": "Four decades ago, EM was the only ancillary technique available to the pathologists when routine H&E and special stains failed to reveal diagnostic features in histopathology [18]. EM examination provides a direct visualization of microbial organisms at a high magnification. Ultrastructural finding is the most direct evidence to show the presence of an infectious agent in clinical specimens. Thin section and negative stain are two common EM methods used to study pathogen morphology and morphogenesis of the microorganisms with recognition of their cytoplasmic organelles and matrix constituents. Therefore, correlation of light and electron microscopic findings not only improves pathologist\u2019s diagnostic acumen but also allows for a more coherent explanation of the pathogenesis. Since the advent of immunohistochemical and molecular techniques, EM has been less often used for identifying infectious agents. However, EM still played an essential role in determining the specific family of the pathogen involved in several outbreaks caused by novel viruses, such as Sin Nombre virus [19, 20], Nipah virus [21, 22], SARS-CoV [12, 23], and monkeypox virus [24]. In these outbreak investigations, negative stain of virus isolated from tissue culture and thin-section preparation of tissue specimen facilitated the ultrastructural examination. The determination of etiologic agents guided subsequent laboratory, clinical, and epidemiologic investigations. Advanced EM methods, such as immuno-EM or EM in situ hybridization using colloidal gold labels, have been developed for a more specific ultrastructural diagnosis.",

A large number of IHC is available that can be helpful in the identification of microorganisms. By using a variety of antibodies, IHC can detect the presence of microbial antigens in tissue specimens, whether they represent the intact or degraded pathogens, and whether they are intracellular or extracellular (Fig. 45.2c). Therefore, IHC has become a powerful technique used by pathologists for tissue diagnosis of infectious diseases. There are many ways to visualize an antibody\u2013antigen interaction. The most common method is to apply an \u00adantibody conjugated to an enzyme, such as peroxidase [28\u201330] or alkaline \u00adphosphatase [31, 32], which can further catalyze a reaction for colorimetric detection. The antibodies used for specific detection can be polyclonal or monoclonal. Polyclonal antibodies are a heterogeneous mixture of antibodies that recognize several epitopes of a specific organism or more commonly, a group of related organisms. Monoclonal antibodies are generated against a single epitope and hence more specific to the target antigen than polyclonal antibodies. Many of these antibodies are commercially available and are widely used in diagnostic pathology laboratories. Others, especially those antibodies for detecting novel emerging pathogens, are available only at highly specialized centers such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Development of new IHC is a worthwhile but usually labor-intensive task. Similar to all other laboratory assays, the sensitivity and specificity of any IHC always need a careful evaluation before establishing its status as a diagnostic assay.",

It is particular useful in detecting those fastidious or slow-growing organisms, such as mycobacteria [36, 37] or Tropheryma whipplei [38], and can improve the speed, sensitivity, and specificity of microbial diagnosis. It is also valuable for characterizing emerging infections, whose causes are initially unknown, such as those caused by Nipah virus [21] or SARS-CoV [12]. Immunolocalization of antigens by IHC provides histomorphologic correlation between the infectious pathogen and host tissue responses, which is not only crucial for diagnosis but also important to study the pathogenesis of those emerging infections [19, 21, 39, 40]. Additionally, IHC performed on fixed tissues can minimize laboratory worker\u2019s potential risk of exposure to infectious agents because of the deactivation of pathogens by formalin fixation. Another advantage of using IHC is its capability of detecting well-preserved microbial antigens in archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues, which allows retrospective studies of many emerging pathogens even after decades of archive [41, 42].",

ISH can localize nucleic acids of microorganisms in tissues and provides histomorphologic correlation between the infectious pathogen and host tissue responses, similar to IHC. The advantages of using formalin-fixed tissues and ISH to detect etiologic pathogens are also similar to IHC, except it is usually less sensitive than IHC because of the potential fragmentation of target nucleic acids by formalin fixation [51, 52].

Processing of tissue samples, especially autopsy tissues, is often performed under a rather lax sterile condition and may enhance the chance of contamination. Many infectious pathogens can be present in the environment as commensals and their clinical relevance from PCR testing results can be confounded by such nature. Therefore, the PCR results should always be evaluated within the context of other diagnostic criteria. Moreover, any PCR testing of formalin-fixed tissues may be compromised by damage to DNA caused by the fixative. It is also important to know that identification to the species level may not be rigorous because the target gene may contain limited amount of sequence data available for comparison.",

Viral microarrays can be roughly divided into those targeting 10\u2013100 agents and those designed for detection of thousands of agents, including unknown pathogens. Arrays designed to address a limited number of agents may employ multiplex consensus PCR to amplify specific genetic targets. Oligonucleotide microarrays with probes of up to 70 nt can offer a considerable advantage for detection of rapidly evolving targets, such as RNA viruses because these arrays are less likely to be confounded by minor sequence variation. Viral microarrays can facilitate sequence analysis and pathogen identification [68, 71\u201373]. Additionally, both microbial and host gene targets can incorporated in these high-density arrays, thus allows an opportunity to detect microbes and assess related host responses simultaneously for pathogenic features consistent with various classes of infectious agents.",

Similarly, adequate tissue sampling is the first and the most important step to obtain an organism-specific diagnosis of infectious diseases by using pathology techniques. The pathology laboratory must have practical guidelines for optimal specimen collection and handling, and should communicate this information to the clinical staff and patient care sites. It is prudent to obtain biopsy or surgical samples from the precise site of infection and preferably before initiation of therapy to minimize the impact of treatment on subsequent diagnostic tests. This is particularly true for bacterial or fungal infections. Tissue specimens obtained surgically are acquired at great expense and pose considerable risk to the patient; therefore they should be procured with an amount of material adequate for both histopathologic and microbiological examination. Swabs are rarely adequate for this purpose. Representative samples from all major organs should be collected in autopsy cases, especially those unexplained fatal cases due to infectious causes.",

For example, herpes simplex virus tends to involve temporal lobe in the brain more frequently, while West Nile virus usually causes more severe infection in brain stem and spinal cord. Moreover, since multiple organs can be involved in the context of systemic diseases, collecting multiple representative portions of target organs with syndrome-based approach (Table 45.3) and tissue samples from any other organ system with findings suggestive of infection ensures the best chance of detecting the causative agent. Influenza-associated myocarditis is a good example to show the difficulty of identifying influenza virus in the heart tissue even with prominent histopathologic changes of myocarditis, while the evidence of infection is usually present in the respiratory tissues [81].\n",

It is highly recommended to embed tissue samples in paraffin no longer than 72 h after adequate formalin fixation.

Because immune mechanisms can greatly amplify the host response, the actual numbers of pathogens present in tissues can be relatively small.

If the tissue specimens are not obtained from relevant lesions or areas with histopathologic changes, the subsequent tests performed on such specimens can all result in false-negative outcomes. Timing of tissue sampling, as mentioned earlier, is another crucial element that can affect test results. Delayed autopsy procedure increases the chance of tissue autolysis and postmortem contamination, which can significantly interfere with histopathologic evaluation and all related pathologic tests. Technical issues, such as sensitivity and specificity, are universally present for each IHC, ISH, or PCR testing. A negative result cannot exclude the possibility of an infection caused by certain organisms because duration of illness, modalities of treatment, tissue sampling and fixation may affect the outcome of these assays. Therefore, a correlation of the test results with clinical history, epidemiological information, and other laboratory assays is highly recommended for a more accurate interpretation involving in patient care and public health management.",
