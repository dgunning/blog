            "text": "During recent years, a paradigm shift has occurred in cancer research. Identification of the molecular pathways involved in cancer initiation and progression will aid scientists to develop new therapies according to the molecular profile of patients [1]. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are pharmaceutically attractive targets for this purpose because they play a critical role in tumor formation. They regulate a variety of signal-transduction pathways within a cell [2], of which c-Met and its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), mediate epithelial tissue remodeling, migration, morphogenesis, cell growth, differentiation, and angiogenesis [2, 3]. Deregulated activation of c-Met-signaling pathway through multiple mechanisms like activation, mutation, gene amplification, and heterodimerization has been reported to correlate with high tumor grade and lower rate of survival in most cancers [3, 4]. Moreover, in 2011, c-Met was found as a marker of pancreatic cancer stem cell, which made it a suitable therapeutic target for cancer treatment [5].",

Upon binding of HGF, receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues of kinase domain in \u03b2 sub-unit occurs, leading to recruitment of multiple effector proteins and promotes the activation of MAPK-signaling, PI3K/Akt-signaling, STAT-signaling, FAK-signaling pathways etc. Over the last decade, small-molecule inhibitors targeting ATP-binding site in kinase domain have been developed and tested in clinical trials [1, 6]. Two distinct binding patterns have been proposed for these ATP-competitive inhibitors: type I compounds (e.g., PF-023410661) bind to activated DFG-in conformation and interact with Met 1160 in the hinge region and Tyr 1230 in the activation loop. Although they are specific, they display limited activity toward Tyr 1230 mutation, while type II compounds (e.g., BMS-777607) are less selective and bind in the inactive DFG-out conformation formed by conformational changes of the Asp1222 side chain [2, 3, 7].",

It has been reported that natural products have great diversity and novel chemical structure which render them useful as new inhibitors. Accordingly, inhibitors derived from natural products have sometimes been called \u201cfourth generation inhibitors\u201d [8]. Actually, natural compounds and their derivatives constitute more than 60% of anticancer drugs [9]. In addition, phytochemicals have been used increasingly for many reasons including low cost, fewer adverse effects, and well-tolerated in the body. Thus, phytochemicals have been discovered as promising compounds for prevention, treatment, or reversal of drug resistance in cancer [10]. Moreover, previous investigations have revealed some flavonoids modulated HGF/c-Met axis in cancer cells; but the intermolecular contacts are unknown [11, 12].",

            "text": "Nowadays, molecular docking is a well-accepted computational method in structure-based drug design for identifying novel hit molecules, which employs a scoring function to evaluate ligand binding orientation and affinity [13\u201315]. In conventional molecular docking, if there is a difference in pose prediction identifying the correct pose will be impossible, while agreement in docked pose will increase accuracy and reduce false positive notably during a virtual screening. This is the objective of consensus docking, which enhances ligand pose prediction by more than one scoring algorithm [16]. Houston et al. reported that a significant improvement in pose prediction accuracy was achieved using Autodock and Vina in 82% of cases. Interestingly, this percentage increased up to 92% when three docking programs; Autodock, Vina, and Dock 6.5, were used simultaneously [16]. It is worthy of note that a Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm and an Amber-force-field-based scoring function have been implemented in Autodock and Vina, respectively [16, 17]. Berry et al. carried out a multi-step Autodock Vina-Glide-GOLD consensus docking procedure to identify novel inhibitors against human coronavirus validated by MD simulation [18]. However, a recent study by Tuccinardi et al focused on the reliability of the consensus docking results in binding pose prediction using ten docking procedures [19].",

The 500 top ranked ligands were further docked using Autodock 4.2.6 [28]. A grid box of 126 \u00d7 126 \u00d7 126 points with 0.153 \u00c5 spacing was defined by centering on the ligand in the active site. When running a docking using the Lamarckian GA, there were a number of parameters to set and, except the number of Lamarckian genetic algorithm runs was set to 100; other parameters were considered as their default values. In all docking studies, residues F1089, V1092, K1110, Y1159, M1160, M1211, D1222, M1229, and Y1230 in the c-Met ATP-binding site were allowed to be flexible. The lowest energy conformation in the Autodock Vina result and the largest cluster of Autodock 4.2 were selected as the resultant docked structure. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) calculation was used to assess the docking poses of Autodock Vina and Autodock 4.2 as described by Houston et al. [16]. Consequently, poses with RMSD more than 2.0 \u00c5 were rejected. To generate a molecular representation of each protein-ligand complex, PyMOL Molecular Graphics System v. 1.7.2 was used. ZINCPharmer (http://zincpharmer.csb.pitt.edu/) was also used to identify the pharmacophore features of the hit molecules [29].",

To obtain ligand topology files based on generalized Amber force field, antechamber was used. A distance of 1 nm was set between a cubic box of TIP3P water molecules and the solute. Steepest descent algorithm was applied until the maximum force of the whole system was below 1000 kJ/mol. During 500 ps of NVT and NPT ensembles, all complexes were simulated to equilibrate at 300 K temperature and 1 bar pressure, respectively. Final simulation runs were carried out for 20 ns with a time step of 2 fs under V-rescale temperature and Parrinello\u2013Rahman pressure coupling algorithms. The particle\u2013mesh Ewald (PME) algorithm was utilized to calculate long-range electrostatics, while Linear Constraint Solver (LINCS) method was used to constrain all covalent bond lengths. A 1.2 nm cutoff was set for van der Waals interactions. VMD 1.9.2 [31] and PyMOL Molecular Graphics System v. 1.7.2 were used to visualize trajectories and generate images, respectively.",

It should be noted that docking simulation provides a single snapshot of interactions between ligand and protein both in rigid and semi-flexible docking. Thus, in order to gain a deeper insight into the effects of protein structural changes and flexibility on the complex interaction profile, a 20-ns MD simulation was performed. The C\u03b1 RMSD in comparison with the initial structure indicated that 1R0P in the apo state experienced continuous fluctuation rising to 0.32 nm at the end of the simulation period. Upon binding of ZINC08234189 at the active site, the average values of conformational changes increased from 0.2 to 0.28 nm, while these changes were negligible for ZINC03871891 (Fig. 4a). In consideration of 2RFS without any ligand, the RMSD value increased to 0.26 nm for the first 4 ns. Thereafter, the receptor reached a plateau for the last 16 ns. Binding stability of 2RFS-ZINC03871891 as a function of time was also analyzed and it was shown that the system converged well with the range of 0.15\u20130.25 nm compared to ZINC08234189 (Fig. 4b). However, it is obvious that the RMSD value of 1R0P-ZINC08234189 was smaller than 2RFS-ZINC08234189. It was observed that around 3 and 5 ns RMSD value of ZINC08234189 underwent noticeable fluctuation due to the lactone ring rotation for 1R0P and 2RFS, respectively, and remained stable till the end (Fig. 4c, d). However, ZINC03871891 achieved relatively stable coordination throughout the entire simulation process. The same results were also observed after the initial and MD-averaged structures were superimposed (Fig. 5).\n\n",

Nevertheless, polar solvation energy (G\nps) has an opposite effect, causing binding energy to depend on its unfavorable positive value [38]. In this regard, van der Waals energy contributed more negative free energy than electrostatic energy in all protein\u2013ligand complexes. Besides, in ZINC03871891-bound complexes, van der Waals interaction was predominant in total binding-free energy, whereas in ZINC08234189-bound complexes, the unfavorable contribution of polar solvation energy was significant.",

Using a 20-ns MD simulation, the stability of each complex was evaluated. Our results showed that both protein and ligand backbone of ZINC08234189 achieved stability after 5 ns. Nevertheless, ZINC03871891 experienced stable conformation in each case during the entire simulation process. Given that hydrogen bond with residues of the hinge region (P1158, M1160) is a hallmark of kinase domain inhibitors, our analysis showed that both hit molecules formed hydrogen bonds with key residues in the active form. In summary, based on hydrogen bond analysis and MM-PBSA studies, we predicted that ZINC08234189 is a plausible inhibitor for the active state of c-Met. In line with our docking results, ZINC03871891 showed more effectiveness toward active c-Met kinase domain than the inactive form due to higher binding energy. The results disclosed here can be useful to overcome Met-addicted cancers.",
