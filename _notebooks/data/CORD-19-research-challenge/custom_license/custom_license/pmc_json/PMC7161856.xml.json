A productive viral infection must spread virus to other hosts to continue the viral life cycle, and the study of viral spread in a population is a principle concern of viral epidemiology. Viral epidemiology not only examines how a virus functions in the host but also opens a window into human habits and interactions. Some viruses are transmitted through aerosols, others via an oral/fecal route, and still others through the transmission of bodily fluids [1]. Thus, many viruses thrive by taking advantage of host habits. By understanding how viruses replicate and spread, students can gain insight into the functions of viruses, cells, and evolution. Many viruses quickly adapt to environmental changes through error\u2010prone replication, resulting in mutations and the generation of viral quasi species in which many genotypes coexist simultaneously during replication in the host cells. Subsequent infection in a new host results in replication by viruses fit for a particular environment [1, 2].",

Picornaviruses are positive (mRNA\u2010like), single\u2010stranded RNA viruses, encased in a 30\u2010nanometer icosahedral protein capsid. Their genomes contain roughly 8,000 nucleotide bases that code for 12 proteins [1, 3]. HRV has a well\u2010characterized genome with three main classifications currently identified: HRVA, HRVB, and HRVC. During replication, millions of viral particles are made; however, the nucleic acids are not exactly identical. The HRV polymerase is error prone, and so several mutations occur through each round of replication. Thus, each viral nucleic acid can be slightly different. These variants are referred to as viral quasi species and enable HRV to adapt to the host [1, 2].",

However, HRV is only one of many respiratory viruses\u2014others, including adenovirus and coronavirus, produce similar symptoms [1, 3]..HRV infections are usually limited to the upper respiratory tract, though they can also result in acute otitis (inflammation of the middle ear), sinusitis (inflammation of the paranasal sinuses), and lower respiratory tract infections [4, 5, 6].",

By analyzing surveys in which subjects indicate severity of their symptoms, stress factors, and average hours of rest per night, students can identify possible contributors to HRV infection.

The sequences were aligned with each other and ATCC reference strains using ClustalW2 and a group tree cladogram was generated (Fig. 3) [12].

Only 10 of the 17 HRV positive subjects chose to participate in the surveys while all 11 of the subjects that tested negative for HRV participated in the surveys. Of those subjects negative for HRV, five were found to have reported being sick. In this instance, other viruses are probably responsible for the observed symptoms. This laboratory can easily be extended to include PCR primers to identify other viruses including influenza, corona virus, and adenovirus among other possibilities [18].",

First, symptom scores correlated positively with being HRV positive (p = 0.15, not significant) or sick (p = 0.0001, significant; Fig. 4\na). Second, the sleep amount correlated positively with being HRV negative (p = 0.1, not significant) or healthy (p = 0.0077, significant; Fig. 4\nb).
