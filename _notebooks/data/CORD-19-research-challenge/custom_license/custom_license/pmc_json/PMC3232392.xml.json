Apoptosis is a physiological process characterized by a number of distinct morphological features and biochemical processes [16,41,42], including cell shrinkage and partial detachment from the substratum, plasma membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation, and intra-nucleosomal cleavage [28]. This form of physiological cell death is morphologically distinct from necrosis, in which the cell swells and disintegrates in a disorderly manner and eventually results in the destruction of the cellular organelles, rupture of the plasma membrane, and leakage of the cell content [39]. Apoptosis is recognized as an important process in different biological systems including embryonic development, cell turnover, and immune response against tumorigenic or virus-infected cells [21,29,37]. An increasing number of viruses or viral gene products have been reported to induce apoptosis [17,22,26,30].",

            "text": "New type gosling viral enteritis (NGVE) is an infectious disease that affects goslings less than 30 days of age, and is caused by an adenovirus called the NGVE virus (NGVEV) [4,5,12,13,15,27,40]. In gosling-producing areas, NGVE has resulted in significant economic losses due to the high mortality of the offspring of breeder geese [12,27]. This disease is clinically characterized by digestive, respiratory, and neurological symptoms along with sudden death [14,15]. Catarrhal haemorrhagic fibrinonecrotic enteritis in the small intestine and intestinal obstruction of the middle-lower portion of the intestine are typical pathological changes observed in NGVEV-infected goslings [15]. Previous immunofluorescence assay and immunohistochemical staining studies indicated that the principal sites of NGVEV antigen localization are the digestive organs and lymphoid organs [9,10]. Furthermore, other studies showed that apoptosis can be induced by NGVEV in monolayer primary duck embryo fibroblasts and the host cells of duck embryos [5-8]. According to our recent research results, NGVEV can induce apoptosis in infected gosling; however, detailed information about this process is still unavailable [11]. To investigate apoptosis evoked by NGVEV infection in vivo, apoptotic morphological changes were observed by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). DNA fragmentation was also monitored with a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay and DNA ladder analysis.",

This was characterized by the cell dehydration and detachment from the substratum, a loss of desmosome in adjacent cells, nuclear chromatin condensation, and endoplasmic reticulum swelling (Fig. 2). Meanwhile, the cells shrank and the electron density of the cytoplasmic contents increased. During the last apoptotic phase (6 to 9 days PI), further morphological changes were observed. At this time, chromatin clumped or broke up into pieces, the cytoplasm condensed, and some vacuoles appeared on the cytoplasm membrane or in the cytoplasm. Subsequently, nuclear fragments and cytoplasm constituents were packaged into apoptotic bodies (Fig. 2C). The target cells included lymphocytes, macrophages, monocytes, epithelial cells, and endotheliocytes.

In addition, some viral particles were observed in apoptotic intestinal epithelia and lymphocytes by TEM. Our previous studies indicated that the lymphoid organs of the infected goslings serve as the principal sites for NGVEV localization [9,10]. It has been suggested that NGVEV infection induced the host cells of BF, Harderian gland, and thymus to undergo apoptosis. Subsequently, theapoptotic epithelia and lymphocytes disrupted the lymphocytic microenvironment. Therefore, apoptotic depletion of the lymphocytes by NGVEV may be partially mediated by this mechanism which is similar to the one proposed for HIV-related thymocyte depletion [34,35]. Furthermore, apoptosis facilitates persistent viral infection in host cells and enables progeny viral dissemination [2,33]. Apoptotic bodies are consumed by neighboring cells via phagocytosis and provide a means for releasing virions into the extracellular fluid without inducing an inflammatory response [22]. It has been hypothesized that virus-induced lymphocytic apoptosis is involved in the pathogenesis of many viral infections [1,3,20,23,38]. Due to apoptosis and necrosis of host lymphocytes, cellular and humoral immune functions are markedly depressed in the central as well as peripheral immune organs after NGVEV infection. It is therefore easy to accelerate the promotion of death by secondary infection.",

It was presumed that apoptotic cells, apoptotic bodies, necrotic cells, and inflammatory cells combined with fibrin filled the intestine lumen to form coagulative obstructions. Apoptosis of the digestive organs contributed to a series of functional disorders of the digestive system which interfered with cells function, resulting in a series of secondary pathological changes and clinical symptoms.",
