The earliest cases of SARS are known to have occurred in mid-November 2002 in Guangdong Province, China. SARS was first recognised in late February 2003, when cases of an atypical pneumonia of unknown cause began appearing among staff at hospitals in Guangdong, China and Hanoi, Vietnam [11]. Within 2 weeks, similar outbreaks occurred in various hospitals in Hong Kong, Singapore and Toronto, and the number of worldwide cases exceeded 4,000 within 2 months, and 7,000 a few weeks later, with cases being reported from 30 countries. During the peak of the global outbreak, near the start of May 2003, more than 200 new cases were being reported each day. More than 900 people died from SARS [12]. China was hit hardest, with over 5,000 patients and approximately 350 deaths. After July, SARS appeared to be under control.",

In the USA in 2002, 4,156 cases were notified among whom 284 died [13]. Severe infection can emerge in Europe too. The H7N7 influenza episode among workers of the Dutch poultry industry in 2003 [14] has shown that the potential for pandemic influenza to start within Europe is there. Circulation of a human strain at the same time as the zoonotic strains (H7N7) were circulating in the poultry worker population could have precipitated the emergence of a new strain adapted to humans with fast secondary diffusion.",

Implementation of precautionary behaviour is largely dependent on effective risk communication, i.e. communication that induces realistic risk perceptions, correct knowledge and skills to promote and enable precautionary practices. Scientific knowledge about these topics in the area of infectious disease control is scarce. Neither is there knowledge if the theories and measures developed for risk perception research on, for example chronic diseases, can be applied in the area of infectious diseases. However, such knowledge is vital for effective control of newly emerging infectious diseases, because our ability to promote health protective behavioural change depends on our knowledge of important determinants of such behaviour [15]. For people to voluntarily engage in precautionary actions, they first of all need to be aware of the risk. Risk perception is a central feature in many health behaviour theories. According to the Protection Motivation Theory, for example [16], protection motivation is the result of the threat appraisal and coping appraisal. Threat appraisal consists of estimates of the chance of contracting a disease (perceived vulnerability or susceptibility) and estimates of seriousness of a disease (perceived severity).",

Unrealistic optimism about health risks is often observed related to familiar risks that are perceived to be largely under volitional control. Such optimism may result in lack of precautions and false feelings of security. A pessimistic bias is more likely for new, unfamiliar risks that are perceived as uncontrollable. Such unwarranted high-risk perceptions may lead to unnecessary mass scares, and are often combined with stigmatisation of specific risk groups. Perceptions of risk are a necessary but often not sufficient condition for engagement is such behaviours. Therefore, higher risk perceptions may only predict protective behaviour when people believe that effective protective actions are available (response efficacy) and when they are confident that they have the abilities to engage in such protective actions (self-efficacy). Preliminary research on SARS as well as avian influenza risk perceptions support these theorised associations and show inverse associations between risk perceptions and efficacy beliefs [2, 18].",

Communications that are perceived as coming from a non-trustworthy source may have the same results. However, risk communication messages are sometimes very quickly adopted by the media, possibly leading to an \u2018amplification\u2019 of risk information that may lead to unnecessary mass scares and unnecessary or ineffective precautionary actions.",

Leppin and Aro first of all make a distinction between a more sociological and a primarily psychological approach to risk perception research. They conclude that the current risk perception research in infectious disease epidemics is seldom theory based or conceptually clear. This is understandable when doing first surveys in the early phases of new emerging epidemics, but there certainly is a need to do consolidate the theoretical and methodological research base. We also need to find out empirically if the theories and methods developed mostly for chronic diseases under volitional control of individuals can be directly applied in emerging epidemics.",

Perceived vulnerability of SARS was at an intermediate level compared to other diseases while perceived severity was high. Perceived threat for SARS varied between countries in Europe and Asia, but these differences did not appear to be associated with the proximity of the SARS 2003 outbreak.",

Jiang and colleagues, in their qualitative study, revealed that information from affected Asia influenced the perceived threat form SARS and protective behaviour among the Chinese in Europe when more relevant local information was absent. When a high perceived threat was combined with low efficacy regarding precautionary measures, avoidance-based precautionary action appeared to dominate responses to SARS. These actions may have contributed to the adverse impact of SARS on the community. The Voeten et al. [5] study results indicate that the Chinese community members relied more on information from friends and Chinese media and had less confidence in their doctor, government agencies and consumer interest groups. While their knowledge of SARS was high, they reported a lower perceived threat and higher self-efficacy than general populations with regard to SARS and avian flu, due to a lower perceived severity.",
