Computational methods are broadly divided into three types: machine learning-based methods combining intrinsic and context-dependent features (Cheng et al., 2013; Deng et al., 2011), flux balance analysis-based methods (del Rio et al., 2009; Gatto et al., 2015; Kuepfer et al., 2005) and homology search and evolutionary analysis-based methods (Peng et al., 2012; Wei et al., 2013).

            "text": "Recently, three research teams approximately identified 2000 essential genes in human cancer cell lines using CRISPR-Cas9 and gene-trap technology (Blomen et al., 2015; Hart et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015). Their results showed high consistency, which further confirmed the accuracy and robustness of the essential gene sets (Fraser, 2015). These studies provided an in-depth analysis of tumor-specific essential genes and feasible methods to screen tumor-specific essential genes (Fraser, 2015; Hart and Moffat, 2016). The essential genes screened by these three teams provided a clear definition of the requirements for sustaining the basic cell activities of individual human tumor cell types. Practically, these genes can be regarded as targets for cancer treatment (Fraser, 2015). The data from these three groups provided a rare opportunity to theoretically study the function, sequence composition, evolution and network topology of human essential genes. One of the most important and interesting theoretical issues in modern biology is whether essential genes and non-essential genes can be accurately classified using computational methods. The models established in the aforementioned three eukaryotic organisms, S.cerevisiae (Chen and Xu, 2005; Seringhaus et al., 2006), Mus musculus (Yuan et al., 2012) and A.thaliana (Lloyd et al., 2015), involved intrinsic features, or intrinsic and context-dependent features. These context-dependent features included those features extracted from experimental omics data. However, the features derived from experimental data are frequently unavailable; consequently, this type of machine learning model cannot be extended to a wide range of genomes. In the present study, we addressed this problem in humans by using only intrinsic features derived from sequences, from which certain features can be characterized using a \u03bb-interval Z curve. The \u03bb-interval Z curve considered information of both adjacent nucleotide compositions and internal nucleotide associations. To facilitate the use of interested researchers, we have provided a user-friendly online web server, Pheg, which can be freely accessed without registration at http://cefg.uestc.edu.cn/Pheg.",

Due to lines HCT116 and KBM7 are represented by two datasets each, 11 cancer cell lines (KBM7, K562, Raji, Jiyoye, A375, HAP1, DLD1, GBM, HCT116, Hela, rpel) are involved in total. Blomen et al. and Wang et al. identified the essential genes in the KBM7 cell line. We combined these two datasets into one gene set, KBM7. A total of 2073 and 386 essential genes were contained in the two datasets for HCT116. The 386 genes in this dataset were markedly different from those in the datasets for the other cell lines, so this dataset was excluded. Ultimately, 11 essential gene sets were obtained, corresponding to a single cell line. Essential genes, by definition, are indispensable for the survival of organisms under optimized growth conditions. Those genes are considered the foundation of life (Juhas et al., 2011), and they should be persistent in a wide range of cell lines and species. Therefore, we only retained genes that were identified as lethal genes in more than half of the investigated cell lines. When a gene appeared as essential in more than six cell lines (11/2 \u2248 6), it was selected as one sample in the positive dataset. According to this principle, we obtained a total of 1518 essential genes. We downloaded all of the protein coding gene sequences from the CCDS database (Harte et al., 2012) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CCDS/CcdsBrowse.cgi), and the annotations of protein coding genes were obtained from the HGNC database (http://www.genenames.org/cgi-bin/statistics, March 1, 2016), which contained 19 003 annotation entries. The essential gene sequences were extracted according to the annotations, and genes with no counterpart in the CCDS database were excluded. According to this criterion, we excluded 2 genes and obtained 1516 essential genes. We used the essential gene annotation in the DEG dataset, and the gene sequences were extracted from the CCDS because the former did not contain the information for non-essential genes. For human essentiality annotations in the DEG database, a number of scattered annotated essential genes aside from those in the 11 cell lines were identified. A total of 28 166 essential gene annotated entries (including conditional essential gene annotated entries) were obtained. Among these annotations, there were many repeated annotation entries; therefore, there were considerably fewer unique entries. To obtain a more reliable negative dataset, i.e. absolutely non-essential genes, we excluded all of the human essential genes annotated in the DEG database (Luo et al., 2014) from the list of the protein coding genes. The remaining genes were regarded as the negative dataset, and their gene sequences were extracted from the CCDS database. Genes with no counterpart in the CCDS database were also excluded. A total of 10 499 non-essential genes were obtained using this method. Ultimately, a total of 12 015 gene entries were obtained in the benchmark dataset: 1516 essential genes and 10 499 non-essential genes. The protein coding gene annotations are provided in Supplementary Material S1, and information for the benchmark dataset is provided in Supplementary Material S2.",

Herein, we provided a summary of the Z curve method used for gene identification (Zhang and Wang, 2000). Let us suppose that the frequencies of bases A, C, G and T occurring in an ORF or a gene fragment at positions 1, 4, 7, \u2026, 2, 5, 8, \u2026 and 3, 6, 9, \u2026, are represented by a1, c1, g1, t1; a2, c2, g2, t2; a3 and c3, g3, t3, respectively. Those 12 symbols represent the frequencies of the bases at the 1st, 2nd and 3rd codon positions, respectively. According to the symbols defined above, the universal Z curve mathematical expression is as follows (Zhang and Wang, 2000):\n(1){xi=(ai+gi)\u2212(ci+ti)yi=(ai+ci)\u2212(gi+ti)zi=(ai+ti)\u2212(gi+ci)xi,yi,zi\u2208[\u22121,1],i=1,2,3\nBecause composition bias for oligonucleotides in coding DNA sequence (CDS) regions or open reading frames (ORFs) exists, the adjacent w-nucleotides Z curve method was proposed (Gao and Zhang, 2004; Guo et al., 2003). Let us suppose that w represents the length of the adjacent nucleotide sequence. The Z curve variables for the phase-specific adjacent w-nucleotides can be calculated as follows:\n(2){xSwk=[pk(SwA)+pk(SwG)]\u2212[pk(SwC)+pk(SwT)]ySwk=[pk(SwA)+pk(SwC)]\u2212[pk(SwG)+pk(SwT)],k=1,2,3ZSwk=[pk(SwA)+pk(SwT)]\u2212[pk(SwG)+pk(SwC)]\nwhere k equals 1, 2, or 3 to indicate that the first oligonucleotide bases are situated at the 1st, 2nd and 3rd codon positions, respectively.",

Although the two adjacent nucleotides in the primary structure have no association in some cases, strong associations in terms of tertiary structure might exist. Therefore, we introduced the \u03bb-interval Z curve to virtually represent the interval range association. The details of this method are described as follows. Let us used pk(SwX) to represent the frequency of oligonucleotides SwX in genes or ORFs, where X is one of the four basic bases A, T, G and C. To facilitate this presentation, the length of the oligonucleotide Sw is represented as w. According to the predetermined characters, we generated the universal equation for the \u03bb-interval Z curve based on Z curve theory as follows:\n(3){xSwk=[pk(SwA)+pk(SwG)]\u2212[pk(SwC)+pk(SwT)]ySwk=[pk(SwA)+pk(SwC)]\u2212[pk(SwG)+pk(SwT)],      k=1:\u03bb+1,2:\u03bb+2,3:\u03bb+3ZSwk=[pk(SwA)+pk(SwT)]\u2212[pk(SwG)+pk(SwC)]\nwhere x, y and z represent the accumulation of the three base groups classified according to chemical bond properties. Variable k denotes the phase-specific index of the first base in the nucleotide sequence Sw, and \u03bb represents the intervals between Sw and X. The first base in the oligonucleotide Sw was located at position k. The core part of \u03bb-interval Z curve forms oligonucleotide SwX. A schematic diagram of the formation of these oligonucleotides is shown in Figure 2. The oligonucleotide window Sw slides along a DNA molecule sequence according to phase, forming oligonucleotide sets with base X, which is \u03bb intervals away from the last base of Sw. The periodicity derived from three codons is denoted as SwX.\n",

Thus, the phase-specific single nucleotide Z curve and phase-specific adjacent w-nucleotide Z curve are incorporated into the \u03bb-interval Z curve. Using the \u03bb-interval Z curve, we can extract more features to characterize DNA sequences. According to Equations (1) and (2), when w is greater than 0 and \u03bb is equal to 0 we can obtain 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 4w\u22121 variables to characterize DNA sequences.

For convenience, we used fvw,\u03bb to represent the variables with the length of w for oligonucleotides Sw, and the highest interval length between oligonucleotides Sw and base X is \u03bb. To obtain more information from a DNA sequence, the final variable is described as FVw, \u03bb, where w represents the longest oligonucleotides and \u03bb is the highest interval.

The new version of LIBLINEAR (version 2.1-4) supports not only classification, such as L2-loss and L1-loss linear support vector machine, but also regression, such as L2-regularized logistic regression. Given the ultra-high-dimensional feature vectors and large samples contained in the benchmark dataset in the present study, we used the LIBLINEAR software package for prediction. The new version of LIBLINEAR can be downloaded from https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/\u223ccjlin/liblinear/. In the present study, we used the 5-fold cross-validation test to determine the best penalty parameter c with the penalty parameter from 2\u221218 to 210. We further adopted the jackknife test to assess the predictive power of our classifier. The area under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic), curve, the AUC, is often used to measure the performance quality of a binary classifier. An AUC of 0.5 is equivalent to random prediction, whereas an AUC of 1 represents a perfect prediction. There is no bias for evaluating the performance of the unbalanced dataset through AUC.

The information redundancy and noise in the original features can influence the predictive power of a classifier, and high-dimensional features also increase the time costs for training and prediction. FS technology can mitigate these disadvantages. The SVM-RFE + CBR method was adopted to rank these features in descending order based on the contribution of each feature. Subsequently, the top 100 features were used to constitute the initial feature subset to train and test the model, and the next 100 features were added into the feature subset, followed by prediction using the same methods. This process was repeated until the top 4500 features had been added according to the rank order. The test results of each model were evaluated according to the AUC scores via a 5-fold cross-validation test. The AUC values for different top features are shown in Figure 3A. Among all 4545 features examined, the best AUC of 0.8814 was achieved for the top 800 selective features. The final AUC value was 8.12% higher than that for FV2,0. To conduct an objective evaluation of this method, we performed a rigorous jackknife test based on the top 800 selected features using the parameters determined via a 5-fold cross-validation test.

Therefore, the PPV reflects the proportion of actual essential genes among the predicted essential genes. We obtained a PPV of 73.05% (TP = 515, FP = 190) using the jackknife test based on the top 800 features. Sn (sensitivity), Sp (specificity) can reflect the correctly predicted percentage of positive and negative samples, respectively.

Note that the Sn is much lower than Sp and this case is cause by the unbalanced dataset (the size of non-essential genes is much larger than essential genes).

We randomly sampled one-fifth of the positive and negative samples from the benchmark dataset for the training model, and the remaining samples were used as the testing dataset.

We obtained a mean AUC score of 0.8347 with a variance of 2.77e-005. These results further confirmed that this method was robust and accurate.",

Therefore, P(A) was obtained based on the number of selected features in each group divided by 800, and P(E) was calculated by dividing the number of total features in each group by 4545. P(A) and P(E) are listed in columns 4 and 5, respectively. If P(A) is higher than P(E), then the group makes a higher-than-average contribution to the identification of essential genes. We calculated the selected tendentiousness using the formula P(A)/P(E)-1, and the results are listed in column 6 of Table 2. We further conducted a hypergeometric distribution test for each group, and the p values are listed in column 7. Figure 3B and Table 2 show that fv2,0 (p = 1.60E-06), fv2,1 (p = 0.024077) and fv3,0(p = 7.89E-05) are preferentially selected and are statistically significant. These results demonstrated that there are strong signals for classifying essential and non-essential genes when the character interval is equal to zero or one, but the other groups did not show these strong signals. To further confirm this result, the variables fv2,0, fv2,1, fv2,2, fv2,3, fv2,4, fv2,5 and fv3,0, fv3,1, fv3,2, fv3,3, fv3,4 and fv3,5 were used as input features. Improved performance was obtained under fv2,0, fv2,1 and fv3,0 compared with the other groups (Table 2, column 8). Those results demonstrated that the shorter interval association provides more information. However, longer interval association can still play an independent role. Hence, integrating the interval information into adjacent ones could significantly improve our classifier\u2019s capacity of discernment (Table 1).",

Pheg\u2019s algorithm is based on the \u03bb-interval Z curve. Additional parameters are not necessary, making this server convenient to use. Pheg can predict whether a query gene (or multi query genes) with FASTA format is (are) essential using only the CDS region of a gene (or multi genes) as input. We integrated logistic regression into the Pheg server to estimate the reliability of the predicted results. Hence, this server can output a probabilistic estimated value as a measurement of gene essentiality for the inputted coding region. This is the first available server for predicting human gene essentiality. Comparatively, some computational models have been proposed for the other eukaryotes however all of them did not provide online prediction service. We re-predicted the genes in the benchmark dataset via Pheg and obtained an AUC = 0.9249 and PPV = 83.84%. A total of 612 genes were identified as essential genes among the 1516 positive samples. This means the number of false negative samples is 904 and tends to be a quite large number. However, this case is pervasive in the issue of essential gene prediction because the researchers try to keep a high TN proportion in order to correctively deal with a very high number of negative samples. Among the 10 499 negative samples in our benchmark, 118 ones were predicted as essential genes by Pheg. To estimate how many genes among those predictions are real essential genes, we calculated precisions using 5-fold, 10-fold, 15-fold and 20-fold cross-validation tests, and we obtained precisions with values of 70.43%, 71.63%, 72.48%, 72.22%, which were approximately 70%. Hence, we expect that 82 (118 \u00d7 70%) are correctly predicted essential genes. The information for these 118 genes is provided in Supplementary Material S3.",

The current mouse essential gene set is accessible in the OGEE database (Chen et al., 2012). Considering that no BLAST program is embedded in OGEE, we downloaded the essential gene annotations (gene_essentiality) at (http://ogee.medgenius.info/downloads/) and extracted the essential gene annotation of M. musculus. We obtained the essential gene sequences according to the annotations (http://ogee.medgenius.info/downloads/). A BLAST search was performed via ncbi-blast-2.2.30+-win64.exe (Shiryev et al., 2007) using the data from OGEE, and homologs for 20 genes were identified (e value < 1e-100) among the 118 predicted essential genes. The details for these 20 genes are provided in Supplementary Material S4. The Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) incorporates high-quality exome sequencing data, and it provides rare opportunity to investigate loss-of-function (LoF) intolerance of a gene via quantitative index pLI (Lek et al., 2016). Herein, The 20 genes identified as essential were further investigated using ExAC Browser (http://exac.broadinstitute.org/). Two-sample t-test illustrated that the mean pLI values between those 20 predicted essential genes and those remained non-essential genes in our negative dataset is significantly different (P < 0.05), indicating functions of the 20 predicted genes are more vital. These results illustrated that at least a part of these 118 genes have higher probability to be factually essential genes and have been overlooked in the essential gene screening in previous experimental studies. Hence, Pheg sever could be used to predict essentiality for anonymous gene sequences of human and closely related species, and identifying novel essential genes using Pheg may supplement the essential gene list of human.",

Table 2 shows the improved performance obtained under fv2,0, fv2,1 and fv3,0 compared with the other variable groups. Further comparison of these results with other feature groups shown in Table 2, and this comparison shows that the AUC values obtained with \u03bb-interval variables are smaller than those obtained with adjacent variables.
