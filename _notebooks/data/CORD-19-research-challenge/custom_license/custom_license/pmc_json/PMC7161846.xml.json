            "text": "For several years, we have been writing about the $1\u20132 billion infused into the substance use disorder (SUD) treatment and prevention system due to the opioid epidemic. In the past two weeks, the American taxpayer has been put on the hook for $8 billion, then $50 billion and now possibly $1 trillion for COVID\u201019 \u2014 most recently to bail out hotels, airlines and businesses in general, not to mention giving checks to individual Americans. This virus needs to be combatted with everything science can offer, but can we really buy people into acceptance of financial losses while not funding treatment, public health and the safety net the way they always should have been funded? You can expect to see fewer headlines about opioids and more about viruses (in the mainstream media, not in ADAW, of course). As ADAW readers well know, addiction goes on. So does good news like recovery. So keep your eye on the ball and advocate for your patients. There must be something in that $1 trillion for them. Your children's great\u2010grandchildren will be paying for it.",
