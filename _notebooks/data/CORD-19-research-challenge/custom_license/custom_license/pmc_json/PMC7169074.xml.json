The world of respiratory infection is an ever\u2010moving landscape as we develop new strategies to target pathogens and in return existing pathogens adapt and new pathogens arise. Equally, we are becoming more and more aware that respiratory infections not only pose acute health emergencies but also contribute substantially to adverse long\u2010term health outcomes.",

New drugs such as bedaquiline and delamanid have been developed, but the sustained effectiveness of these antibiotics is threatened by haphazard use and, therefore, how, when and to whom they should be given is a major area of current controversy. Dheda et al. argue that the outcomes from treatment of multidrug\u2010resistant (MDR) tuberculosis are so poor that it may be unethical to withhold bedaquiline regardless of concerns about the development of resistance. Equally, they argue that more resources are desperately needed to adequately control tuberculosis, and especially drug\u2010resistant diseases, in the developing world.",

This problem is mostly seen in the tertiary settings of more advanced economies. Rather than poverty, malnutrition and overcrowding driving the problem as with tuberculosis, frequent use and misuse of broad\u2010spectrum antibiotics in patients with a fundamental inability to resist infection (such as in those with severe chronic obstructive airway disease, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis or major organ failure requiring prolonged stays in intensive care units) are responsible for MDR\u2010GNB. As Rodrigo\u2010Troyano and Sibila point out, unlike tuberculosis, there has been very little progress in antibiotic development for MDR\u2010GNB and case reports are increasing for pan\u2010resistant organisms immune to all known therapies. While newer antibiotics are desperately needed, important factors that Rodrigo\u2010Troyano and Sibila did not focus on are the key role of effective antibiotic stewardship5, 6 and appropriate end\u2010of\u2010life care7, 8 in reducing the selective pressure for MDR pathogens.",

With such a range, reliance on guidelines published in other countries without consideration of local aetiology is a recipe for disaster. Aston10 also pointed out that the syndrome of pneumonia needs a very different approach in developing economies compared with developed ones. First, the possibility of tuberculosis and/or human immunodeficiency virus infection, not usually major factors in developed economies, is always a potential problem. Second, many of the tools for treating pneumonia in developed economies have not been tested in developing countries. Lim and Siow11 further noted that in addition to tuberculosis, in tropical countries, the spectrum of pathogens with pneumonia includes diseases such as scrub typhus, leptospirosis, chikungunya and dengue as well as parasitic pneumonias. Overall, there is a very strong message that clinicians must be aware of what causes pneumonia in their local area and not rely on guidelines from elsewhere.",

Basnayake et al.12 highlight this fact by pointing out the very high rate of bronchiectasis in indigenous populations. A major factor in the high rates of bronchiectasis in indigenous people is the greater burden of respiratory infection, especially pneumonia, related to relative economic and social deprivation compared with the rest of the population.",

Mecham et al.16 explored the increasing use of technology to improve patient outcomes, especially clinical decision support tools.
