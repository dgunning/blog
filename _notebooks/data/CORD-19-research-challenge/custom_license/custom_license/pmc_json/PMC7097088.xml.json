Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is the only known functional receptor for SARS-CoV infection6.

Unlike DC-SIGN, which is expressed, for example, on dendritic cells, L-SIGN is expressed in the liver, lymph nodes and placenta9,10. The extracellular regions of both CLEC4M and CD209 contain tandem repeats of a highly conserved 23-amino acid sequence, followed by a C-terminal C-type carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD)11,12,13. In contrast to CD209, CLEC4M has considerable polymorphism in the tandem repeat domain of exon 4, which consists of three to nine repeats of a 69\u2013base pair segment, with seven repeats being predominant (>50%) in the general population10. This tandem repeat segment encodes the extracellular neck region and has been suggested to be important for homo-oligomerization of L-SIGN on the cell surface, which brings the CRDs into proximity for high-affinity ligand binding10,11. It has been suggested that heterozygous expression of polymorphic variants of L-SIGN, in which neck lengths differ, may prevent the formation of hetero-oligomers and may thus lead to a reduced ligand-binding affinity8.",

Recently, it has been shown that pseudotyped lentiviral particles presenting SARS-CoV spike protein can bind to both DC-SIGN18 and L-SIGN19. Recent data have further demonstrated that L-SIGN can bind SARS-CoV20. It has also been shown that individual susceptibility to SARS infection may depend on genetic factors of the host: for example, HLA class I polymorphism21,22. As L-SIGN can bind SARS-CoV and its homo- or heterozygosity may determine the ligand-binding capacity, we hypothesized that CLEC4M homo- or heterozygosity might affect individual susceptibility to SARS infection. We therefore performed a genetic risk association study and a series of in vitro experiments to examine the biological role of L-SIGN in SARS infection.",

For comparison with corresponding controls, and because at least one-fifth of SARS patients in Hong Kong and elsewhere were health care workers23, as also reflected in our series, we further subclassified our SARS patients into two groups: (i) 67 who were health care workers (hereafter called 'health care workers with SARS') infected in hospitals during the course of duty and (ii) the remaining 218 who were recruited from the community ('community SARS'; Table 1). The CLEC4M 69-nucleotide tandem repeats in exon 4 were genotyped by PCR followed by gel electrophoresis, and results were further verified by DNA blotting analysis in selective cases of representative genotypes (data not shown).",

To analyze whether the status of being a health care worker may have an impact on susceptibility, we performed a similar analysis separately in the non\u2013health care worker population and health care worker populations. In the non\u2013health care worker population, community SARS versus outpatient controls gave an odds ratio of 0.698 (95% c.i. = 0.490\u20130.993, P = 0.045; Table 2). In the health care worker population, health care workers with SARS versus health care worker controls demonstrated an odds ratio of 0.536 for homozygotes (95% c.i. = 0.303\u20130.950, P = 0.031; Table 2). In the stratified analysis between these two populations, the test of heterogeneity comparing the reduced odds ratios in the non\u2013health care worker and the health care worker populations (odds ratio = 0.698 and 0.536, respectively) did not demonstrate a significant difference (P = 0.442, Table 2). This subsequently allowed us to perform a test for overall association based on the non\u2013health care worker and health care worker populations between the SARS patients and control subjects. Results again demonstrated an overall odds ratio of 0.649 (95% c.i. = 0.481\u20130.876, P = 0.005, Table 2), further confirming that a reduced risk was associated with homozygotes, irrespective of whether an individual was a health care worker. Furthermore, as the outpatient controls and the random controls did not differ from each other in their individual genotype frequencies or homo- or heterozygote frequencies (P = 0.737 and 0.755, respectively, Table 1), these two controls were grouped together as 'combined controls'. Analysis of all SARS patients versus combined controls again gave an odds ratio of 0.691 for homozygotes (95% c.i. = 0.523\u20130.913, P = 0.009). On the other hand, analysis of the allele and genotype frequencies showed that the effect of differences in allele or genotype frequencies was either absent or inconsistent (Table 3), indicating that the homo- or heterozygosity per se, but not any specific allele or genotype that constitutes the homo- or heterozygosity, influences the susceptibility to SARS infection.",

After binding to L-SIGN, the total viral copy number decreased substantially by 24 h and 48 h in all three transfectants (Fig. 2b) with no obvious cytopathic effect (data not shown). Thus, there was no evidence of productive viral replication. Furthermore, the reduction of total viral copy number over at least 24 h was greater for N7 and N5 L-SIGN/CHO than for N7/N5 transfectants (Fig. 2b). In addition, the viral copy number in the supernatants at 24 h and 48 h was extremely low (Supplementary Fig. 1 online).

To examine this possibility, Vero E6 cells transfected with N7 or N7/N5 L-SIGN were infected with 0.01 PFU/cell SARS CoV. At least 60% of the cells expressed surface L-SIGN on day 2 post-transfection as determined by flow cytometry (data not shown). After 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, we washed the cells and further incubated them for 24 h and 48 h and subsequently measured total ORF-1b and nucleocapsid copy number. Expression of N7 or N7/N5 L-SIGN on transfected Vero E6 cells ('L-SIGN/Vero') did not result in higher viral ORF-1b (Fig. 3b, left) or nucleocapsid (Fig. 3b, right) copy numbers. Infection of Vero E6 cells with 1 PFU/cell induced substantial cell death after 24 h and 48 h culture owing to the cytopathic effect of the virus (data not shown), precluding studies using this higher titer. Because the majority of nucleocapsid gene sequence was derived from subgenomic mRNA produced upon active replication28,29, the results indicate that the virus replicates with the same efficiency in these cells. We obtained similar results in additional experiments using CHO and A549 cell lines that had been transfected with ACE2 alone, or with both ACE2 and N7 L-SIGN (Supplementary Fig. 4 online).",

Infection of fresh Vero E6 cells for 48 h with serially titrated supernatants harvested from the 48 h culture of infected N7 L-SIGN/Vero E6 cells indeed resulted in a substantially lower final viral genomic copy number than did infection with supernatants from infected N7/N5 L-SIGN/Vero cells and mock transfectants (Supplementary Fig. 5 online). To exclude the possibility that expression of N7 L-SIGN in permissive cells might interfere with virus budding or release, N7 L-SIGN/Vero cultures were treated with antibodies against L-SIGN before and during the viral pulse and subsequent 48 h incubation. Notably, blockade of surface L-SIGN resulted in an increase of the number of viral genomic copies in the supernatants, with a reciprocal decrease in cell lysates (Fig. 4b). In separate experiments, we also treated N7 L-SIGN/Vero cells with 5 mM EGTA for an additional 1 h at the end of 48 h culture before harvest. Treatment with EGTA, a calcium-chelating reagent that can inhibit and reverse calcium-dependent binding such as that to L-SIGN, resulted in a decrease of viral copies in the cellular lysates of N7 L-SIGN/Vero cells with a reciprocal increase in the supernatants (Fig. 4c).",

Nevertheless, direct comparison of SARS-infected individuals and the corresponding controls, together with the stratified analysis, shows that CLEC4M homozygotes are significantly less susceptible to SARS infection, irrespective whether an individual is a health care worker (Table 2). Such a reduced risk is associated with L-SIGN homozygosity per se, rather than any specific allele or genotype (Table 3). In a separate study, we compared the genotypes of Chinese random controls with those of 58 unrelated individuals of European descent from the CEPH Reference Family. The genotypes of both Chinese and European cohorts were in HWE (Supplementary Table 1 online), and the allele frequencies of our European cohort were similar to those previously reported in other European populations10,30. Allele frequencies of CLEC4M tandem repeats in the Chinese population were significantly different from those in Europeans (P < 0.0001, Supplementary Table 1). There was also a significant difference in the genotype and homo- or heterozygote frequency in these two populations (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.002, respectively, Supplementary Table 1). It remains to be investigated whether these differences between Chinese and Europeans may result in different susceptibility for SARS infection.",

These L-SIGN+ cells are either ACE2bright or ACE2dim/\u2212 (Fig. 1a), implying that L-SIGN may be expressed by at least two different subsets of cells. Indeed, in a separate study we found that L-SIGNbrightACE2dim/\u2212 cells expressed cytokeratin, indicating that they are epithelial cells, as also suggested in a recent report20. In contrast, L-SIGNbrightACE2bright cells do not express cytokeratin (data not shown). The nature of these cells is unknown and needs to be further characterized. Although L-SIGNbrightACE2dim/\u2212 cells are consistently found in lung tissue of all non-SARS samples, L-SIGNbrightACE2bright cells are found only in samples from half of the non-SARS individuals (four of eight); this needs further investigation. Nevertheless, the finding that L-SIGN is consistently expressed in cells that expressed both SARS-CoV antigen and ACE2 in the lung and small bowel of patients fatally infected with SARS (Fig. 1b,c) strongly suggests that L-SIGN may be involved in SARS-CoV infection. Notably, SARS antigen is found in L-SIGNdim/\u2212ACE2dim/\u2212 cells in SARS-infected lung (Fig. 1b). The nature of these virus-containing cells that do not express the only known functional receptor, ACE2, is unclear, but they are not alveolar macrophages, because they do not express CD68 (Supplementary Fig. 7 online), a macrophage-specific marker34.",

After binding to L-SIGN, there is no or little viral dissociation, and viruses undergo degradation over time, with the homozygous cells more efficient than the heterozygous cells (Fig. 2b). It has been reported that levels of SARS-CoV subgenomic RNA were increased 24 h after infection of L-SIGN\u2013expressing cells20. However, such an increase was transient, and SARS-CoV antigen was detected by immunofluorescence staining in fewer than 1% of the infected L-SIGN\u2013expressing cells20, which argues against efficient and productive viral replication mediated by L-SIGN. Furthermore, L-SIGN\u2013mediated viral degradation is, at least in part, proteasome-dependent, because it can be inhibited partially by proteasome inhibitors (Fig. 2c), although interference with proteasomes may also lead to indirect inhibition of upstream processes involved in the degradation of endocytosed SARS-CoV particles.",

            "text": "L-SIGN can also bind HIV and SIV and mediates infection of permissive cells in trans14. Expression of L-SIGN on permissive cells facilitates trans, but not cis, infection of SARS-CoV, at least when cells are initially infected with 0.01 PFU/cell (Fig. 3), a titer that may be more representative of the setting of primary infection than a higher one. The observation that N7 L-SIGN/CHO cells bind SARS-CoV more efficiently but mediate a poorer trans infection than N7/N5\u2013expressing cells is interesting. It is likely that a higher binding capacity may lead to more efficient internalization and degradation, thereby resulting in a lower ability for trans delivery of the virus. In separate experiments in which the viral copy number was determined separately in cell lysates and supernatants, the cell lysates of SARS-infected homozygous N7 L-SIGN/Vero cells contained significantly higher viral copy number than those of heterozygous N7/N5 L-SIGN/Vero cells (Fig. 4a). This finding is consistent with a recent report that after infection with SARS-CoV spike protein\u2013containing pseudotyped virus and incubation for 3 d, the luciferase activity in the cell lysates, which should correlate with the viral copy number, is higher in nonpermissive cells transfected with both ACE2 and N7 L-SIGN than in cells transfected with ACE2 alone19. Reciprocally, supernatants of SARS-infected homozygous N7 L-SIGN/Vero cells have a significantly lower viral copy number than supernatants of heterozygous N7/N5 L-SIGN/Vero cells (Fig. 4b). This implies that cells expressing N7 L-SIGN, but not heterozygous N7/N5, seem to retain a high proportion of viruses in a cell-associated form, leading to decreased levels of infectious virions in the supernatants. Taken together, we suggest that L-SIGN expressed on permissive cells (such as in L-SIGNbrightACE2bright cells; Fig. 1) may actually capture or sequester SARS viruses that have been liberated after replication, at least after 48 h incubation, when the viral copy numbers significantly increase. Capture, absorption and degradation of the released viruses via binding to L-SIGN would result in a lower amount of infectious virions in the local environment, which could limit subsequent viral spread to other permissive cells for further infection. In vivo, however, the outcome of SARS-CoV infection is likely to be a combination of L-SIGN\u2013mediated capturing, internalization and degradation and/or trans delivery of virus to permissive cells. In a closed infection system in which no wash procedures were conducted in order to maintain a constant titer for infection, we demonstrated that cultures of permissive cells with homozygous, but not heterozygous, L-SIGN\u2013expressing cells have significantly lower final viral genomic and subgenomic copy numbers (Fig. 5). This observation confirms that homozygous L-SIGN does have a protective role in SARS-CoV infection.",

This observation is supported by our in vitro studies showing that homozygous L-SIGN plays a protective role by reducing the final total viral titers in cultures with permissive cells. In part this can be attributed to an increased binding capacity of homozygous L-SIGN which results in greater cell association of virions, increased proteasome-dependent viral degradation and a consequent lower capacity for trans infection. Our results show a novel role of L-SIGN in SARS infection. Whether our findings are also relevant to the pathogenesis and disease susceptibility of other L-SIGN-binding pathogens deserves further investigation.",
