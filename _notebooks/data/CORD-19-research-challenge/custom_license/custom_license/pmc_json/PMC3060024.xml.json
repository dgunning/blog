This type of long\u2010term immune activation is often linked to aberrations of the adaptive immune system, involving antigen\u2010specific antibodies or effector T\u2010cell responses that react against endogenous stimuli.\n1\n, \n2\n It is possible, however, that components of the innate immune system also contribute to the development of chronic inflammatory disease.\n3\n Thus, precisely how the immune system drives chronic inflammatory disease still needs to be fully defined. In that context, lung disease offers a useful paradigm for investigating mechanisms underlying chronic inflammation as chronic obstructive lung disease represents one of the most common types of chronic illness that affects humans. In particular, asthma affects approximately 10% of the population, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide.\n4\n Although asthma and COPD are regarded as separate clinical entities, it is evident that overlapping airway pathology can occur in both diseases.\n5\n It is even possible that patients diagnosed initially with asthma may be at risk for developing COPD later in life.\n6\n Thus, asthma and COPD may constitute discrete manifestations of a disease continuum resulting from a common pathological process that should be defined in molecular, rather than clinical, terms.",

Of special interest to this review, several clinical studies have proposed a role for respiratory viral infection in precipitating as well as contributing to the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive lung disease. Perhaps the strongest disease association for virus\u2010induced lung disease exists for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),\n7\n a member of the Paramyxoviridae family that commonly infects the bronchial airways of infants and adults, causing severe bronchiolitis in a subpopulation of individuals.\n8\n A number of prospective case\u2010controlled studies provide evidence that severe RSV\u2010induced bronchiolitis in early infancy constitutes a significant risk factor for the subsequent development of childhood asthma.\n9\n, \n10\n, \n11\n, \n12\n, \n13\n Putative etiological associations have also been made for other respiratory viruses, but most of these (especially human metapneumovirus [hMPV], rhinovirus [RV], human parainfluenza virus [hPIV], adenovirus, and coronavirus) are more likely associated with exacerbation of existing disease.\n14\n Furthermore, a number of clinical studies suggest that respiratory viral infections are the major trigger for exacerbations of asthma and COPD.\n15\n, \n16\n, \n17\n, \n18\n, \n19\n, \n20\n, \n21\n This association has been confirmed experimentally using mouse models that have demonstrated that viral infection can cause features of inflammatory lower airway disease in susceptible strains of mice.\n22\n, \n23\n However, these observations did not fully develop a causal relationship between respiratory viral infection and chronic airway disease or define the precise mechanism by which viral infections contribute to the development and persistence of this type of disease.",

Presumably, this immune balance of reaction versus tolerance may become permanently skewed and thereby progress to chronic inflammation. A scheme that is commonly used to describe inflammation in the lung (and other sites) is based on a model of immune polarity for the T helper (Th) cell system. Within this system, CD4+ Th cell\u2010dependent responses are classified into Th type 1 (Th1) or type 2 (Th2). Th1 cells characteristically mediate delayed\u2010type hypersensitivity reactions and selectively produce interleukin (IL)\u20102 and interferon (IFN)\u2010\u03b3. This type of response is also found during respiratory viral infection. In contrast, Th2 cells promote B\u2010cell\u2010dependent humoral immunity, IgE class switching, eosinophil recruitment, mast cell proliferation, alternative activation of macrophages, and selective production of IL\u20104, IL\u20105, and IL\u201013 that are all typical of an infection with an extracellular parasite and are commonly found during an allergic response.\n24\n Indeed, this type of response can be detected in allergen\u2010challenged mice as well as allergic asthmatics,\n5\n, \n25\n, \n26\n, \n27\n and Th2 cytokine production is often a prominent feature of asthma.\n28\n, \n29\n, \n30\n, \n31\n For example, IL\u201013 is increased in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids of allergen\u2010provoked asthmatic subjects\n30\n and IL\u201013 mRNA and protein expression has been detected in bronchial biopsies obtained from allergic and nonallergic asthmatic patients.\n32\n, \n33\n In addition, polymorphisms at the IL\u201013 gene locus have been shown to confer an enhanced risk of asthma and COPD.\n34\n, \n35\n, \n36\n Increased IL\u201013 expression is also found in some but not all studies of subjects with COPD.\n37\n, \n38\n, \n39\n This discrepancy is likely a result of the heterogeneity of disease within and between individuals and is a challenge for current clinical trials of anti\u2010IL\u201013 therapy in subjects with asthma.\n40\n\n",

For example, RSV infection may elicit Th2 cytokine production in allergen\u2010sensitized mice.\n41\n, \n42\n, \n43\n Whether RSV infection can drive persistent production of IL\u201013 remains uncertain. Moreover, allergic inflammation is not characteristic of all forms of asthma or COPD. For example, bronchial biopsy specimens obtained from subjects with severe asthma and COPD often contain increased numbers of CD8+ T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils.\n44\n, \n45\n Moreover, subjects with even moderate asthma exhibit activation of IFN\u2010signaling proteins, indicative of a Th1\u2010type response.\n46\n Furthermore, studies in mice using adoptive transfer protocols indicate that pro\u2010inflammatory cells, such as Th1 CD4+ and CD8+ T\u2010cell subsets, can potentiate allergic airway disease.\n47\n, \n48\n Concerning as well is the observation that many forms of airway disease that are \u201cTh2\u2010polarized\u201d are in fact precipitated by exposure to nonallergic stimuli (such as respiratory viruses) that would ordinarily elicit a Th1 response. Lastly, the Th1 versus Th2 paradigm has been further challenged by the discovery of Th17 (IL\u201017\u2010producing) and T regulatory or Th3 (IL\u201010\u2010 and transforming growth factor [TGF]\u2010\u03b2\u2010producing) subsets of T cells, which appear to influence allergic inflammation of the airways.\n49\n, \n50\n Thus, the immune response underlying chronic airway disease does not strictly adhere to the Th2 paradigm as aspects of both Th1 and Th2 immune responses appear to drive disease.\n51\n, \n52\n, \n53\n Because the Th1 versus Th2 model of adaptive immunity did not fully explain the subsequent development and maintenance of chronic inflammatory disease, we questioned whether other aspects of immunity and inflammation might also be critical for the pathogenesis of chronic airway disease following viral infection. Accordingly, we sought to establish an experimental model that would enable us to precisely assess the role of the innate and adaptive systems in the development and maintenance of chronic obstructive lung disease.",

The most common approach for these models involves sensitization and subsequent airway challenge using chicken ovalbumin, but others have also applied allergens derived from insects, e.g., house dust mite and cockroach, as well as infectious agents, e.g., Schistosoma mansoni, Nippostrongylus brasilensis, and Aspergillus fumigatus. Although these models do not fully replicate the features of asthma in humans, they serve to identify cellular and molecular determinants of allergen\u2010induced inflammation.\n54\n, \n55\n, \n56\n, \n57\n, \n58\n A critical drawback to acute allergen challenge models is the transient nature of the airway disease. Allergen\u2010driven models of airway disease therefore fundamentally limit study of the immune mechanisms that contribute to persistent inflammation found in chronic obstructive lung disease in humans.

The rationale for developing this type of model is rooted in epidemiological evidence linking acute viral infection with chronic airway disease.\n9\n, \n10\n, \n11\n, \n12\n, \n13\n, \n15\n, \n16\n, \n17\n, \n18\n, \n19\n, \n20\n, \n21\n Because infection with RSV is most strongly linked to the development of asthma, investigators have often used RSV as the etiological agent for study. In fact, RSV infection alone or in combination with allergen challenge has now been studied as a model for airway inflammation in guinea pigs, ferrets, rats, and mice.\n59\n, \n60\n, \n61\n, \n62\n, \n63\n On the basis of similar associations with exacerbations of asthma, others have also studied human rhinovirus (RV) and metapneumovirus (hMPV). The limitation of these models is that human pathogens often replicate poorly in other species. In the case of RSV, an extremely high inoculum of virus must be administered in order to cause disease in mice, resulting in an all\u2010or\u2010none pattern of illness.\n64\n Accordingly, we have advanced a model based on a natural mouse pathogen known as Sendai virus (SeV), a parainfluenza virus closely related to other human paramyxoviruses (e.g., RSV, hMPV, and hPIV). In contrast to RSV, SeV replicates at high efficiency in the lower airway of mice, resulting in acute inflammation of the small airways that maintains high fidelity to viral bronchiolitis in humans. Administration of a modest SeV inoculum (e.g., 1 \u00d7 105 plaque\u2010forming cells) to young immunocompetent mice (e.g., 6\u201310 weeks of age) elicits a top\u2010down pattern of infection that is limited to airway epithelial cells and neighboring macrophages.\n65\n, \n66\n, \n67\n This illness is therefore remarkably similar to the one observed in severe RSV infections in humans. It appears likely that this pattern of infection is necessary for the subsequent development of chronic lung disease in this model and perhaps in humans as well.",

This model of disease is relevant to a clinical understanding of post\u2010viral inflammatory airway disease, a condition that is marked by airway hyper\u2010reactivity and is sometimes associated with elements of atopy, including elevated levels of serum IgE.\n86\n This condition often resolves by several weeks after viral infection (in humans and in the mouse model), but it is possible that a chronic inflammatory condition might develop in the face of ongoing infectious or allergic stimuli.",

In addition, the cells were derived from uninfected mice to avoid downregulation of T\u2010cell receptor (TCR) function and background production of IL\u201013. Using this co\u2010culture system, we found that direct NKT\u2010cell\u2013macrophage interaction resulted in production of Il\u201013 mRNA and IL\u201013 protein by adherent macrophages within 24 h of co\u2010culture. The NKT\u2010cell effect on macrophage production of IL\u201013 was relatively specific for lung NKT cells as naive CD4+ T cells failed to induce IL\u201013 production by macrophages. Furthermore, NKT\u2010cell\u2010induced production of IL\u201013 by macrophages was significantly inhibited by treatment with an anti\u2010CD1d\u2010blocking mAb and markedly increased by addition of \u03b1\u2010GalCer, a synthetic CD1d ligand. These results indicated that NKT\u2010cell\u2010dependent activation of macrophages required interaction of V\u03b114\u2010J\u03b118 invariant TCR on the NKT cell with CD1d on the macrophage.

(A) For the first phase of chronic disease, viruses cause airway epithelial cell (AEC) and plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) production of type I interferon (IFN). Subsequent type I IFN receptor(IFNAR) signaling leads to upregulation of Fc\u025bRI expression on resident lung conventional (c)DCs. In turn, Fc\u025bRI activation by viral antigen and antiviral IgE leads to production of CCL28 and recruitment of CCR10\u2010expressing IL\u201013\u2010producing T helper (Th)2 cells to the lung. The actions of IL\u201013 drive differentiation of airway epithelial cell precursors toward mucous cells (mucous cell metaplasia) and airway smooth muscle cells to become more reactive to contractile agonists (airway hyper\u2010reactivity [AHR]). (B) For the second phase of chronic disease, viral remnants activate antigen\u2010presenting cells (APCs) and thereby facilitate CD1d\u2010dependent antigen presentation and consequent activation of invariant CD4\u2212 natural killer T (NKT) cells. NKT cells then interact directly with lung macrophages via IL\u201013 production and binding to the IL\u201013 receptor (IL\u201013R) as well as contact between invariant Va14 T\u2010cell receptor (TCR) and glycolipid\u2010loaded CD1d. This interaction leads to increased expression of IL\u201013R and production of IL\u201013 that drives a positive feedback loop to amplify IL\u201013 production and alternative activation of macrophages, including Chi3l3/4, Fizz1, Mmp12, Arg1, and Alox12e gene expression in mice and Chit1, Arg1, and Alox15 in humans.",
