Some examples of bacterial bioterrorism agents include Y. pestis (Prentice and Rahalison 2007), B. anthracis, F. tularensis, Brucella spp., B. pseudomallei, V. cholerae, and S. typhi. Y. pestis and V. cholerae are pathogens for plague and cholera, respectively, which are two Class A infectious diseases as defined by the Law on Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases issued by the People\u2019s Republic of China. Most viral bioterrorism agents are classified as RNA viruses, such as Marburg virus, Forest encephalitis virus, Hanta virus, Human immunodeficiency virus, SARS coronavirus, MERS coronavirus, Ebola virus, Spanish flu virus, H1N1 flu virus, Avian flu virus, Hepatitis C virus and Rabies virus; in contrast there are few DNA viruses, such as Hepatitis B virus. Rickettsial bioterrorism agents include Coxiella burnetii, Rickettsia rickettsia, and Rickettsia prowazekii among others, and they are strictly parasitic microorganisms. Chlamydia psittaci are the main chlamydial bioterrorism agents and can infect many bird species and humans. Biotoxin bioterrorism agents are noxious materials secreted by live organisms, such as plants, animals, microorganisms and insects, and are regarded as occupying the space between traditional biological and chemical terrorism agents. Common biotoxin bioterrorism agents, botulinum toxin and S. aureus enterotoxin, are secreted by microorganisms, while ricin and abrin are extracted from plants. There are two categories of biotoxins, one group are proteins or peptides such as ricin and abrin, and the other are small molecule toxins, such as afaltoxin and T-2 toxin (Wang 2011). Protein biotoxins combine an activity unit (unit A) and binding site (unit B). Unit A is the functional domain and unit B promotes the introduction of the toxin into cells.",

The bioterrorism agents disseminated through air can be made into aerosols and threaten public health on a large-scale, examples include Rickettsia rickettsii, Y. pestis (Agar et al. 2009), and B. anthracis (Estill 2009). Some zoonotic pathogens can infect people through contact with infectious animals during slaughter and leather treatment, and animal husbandry, as well as contact between people (Begier et al. 2006). Transmission through food includes consumption of the meat or milk of infected animals, for instance, people can be infected by V. cholerae through contaminated seafood (Finelli et al. 1992). Water is also an important transmission medium and is the main transmission route for V. cholerae (Hill et al. 2011). In addition, some agents, for example, B. anthracis spore can survive in the silt at the bottom of a riverbed for decades, and F. tularensis can survive in the cold water of a river for months (Chitadze et al. 2009), seeking the chance for outbreak. Transmission media arthropods such as mosquitos, flies, lice, mites, and ticks, are widespread in nature. The transmission media of Y. pestis, F. tularensis, yellow fever virus, and Rickettsia przewalskii are flea, tick, mosquito and pediculus humanus corporis, respectively.",

Several microorganisms can multiply rapidly in vivo, causing serious diseases, for instance, the infectious dose of F. tularensis type A is less than ten live cells. Bioterrorism agents attack the respiratory tract, digestive tract, skin, blood, and glands. Many of the agents cannot be handled by the immune system, and Y. pestis can even survive, proliferate and spread in macrophages (Lukaszewski et al. 2005). Acute and serious diseases occur after a short incubation period, often only several days. For instance, the symptoms of pneumonic plague include high fever, cold shivers, cough, chest pain, hemoptysis, and dyspnea, followed by serious poisoning symptoms and death in two to four days. The mortality of pneumonic and generalized plague is up to 30 ~ 60%. Brucella spp. with anti-phagocytic capsules can proliferate in the lymphatic system and then enter into the blood resulting in toxemia, and its ability to evade elimination by the body results in long-term joint pain, fatigue, and disability, dramatically decreasing the quality of life of the patient. The most catastrophic potential outcome is a worldwide epidemic. Three historic large-scale plague epidemics caused 160 million deaths (Prentice and Rahalison 2007), seven historic cholera epidemics involved 100 countries, and brucellosis is prevalent in 170 countries.",

Epidemiological history includes residency in the epidemic areas or entrance into these areas in the last two weeks before morbidity, bites by arthropods, and contact with or consumption of infected products or water. Clinical syndromes of some bioterrorism agents appear in isolation, however agents with many infection routes can cause various clinical syndromes. For example, the main clinical syndrome of cholera is diarrhea, however at least six syndromes have been found for tularaemia, including bubonic, pneumonic, gastrointestinal, and systemic (typhoidal and septicemic) tularaemia. The similarity of clinical syndromes between diseases caused by bioterrorism agents and by other factors, makes accurate pathogenesis diagnosis more difficult for doctors when the etiology is unknown. For example, patients with fever caused by F. tularensis are easily misdiagnosed with influenza (Simsek et al. 2012), while there are no differences the in clinical syndromes between pneumonia caused by F. tularensis or that arising from other causes (Stralin et al. 2002). Misdiagnosis and delayed treatment are responsible for lack of safeguard implementation and the subsequent dissemination of bioterrorism agents in medical institutions. Therefore, etiology detection is critical for determining and preventing infectious disease. However, the low numbers of pathogens in the initial stage of a disease are difficult to find by etiology detection, fortunately early diagnosis based on the detection of antibodies in blood is a plausible approach in practice.",

However, no effective vaccine has been obtained for some bioterrorism agents, such as Chlamydia psittaci. There are some effective virus vaccines, such as Vaccinia vaccine (against Smallpox virus), Rabies vaccines, Hepatitis B vaccines, and Hantavirus vaccine.

The short response time for surveillance in natural foci and during public health emergencies has provided powerful support for the prevention of disease outbreaks. The minimal operation procedures that are a feature of POCT methods make POCT applicable for detecting bioterrorism agents to reduce the release of the agents. Immunochromatography is well known as a POCT method for onsite screening of bioterrorism agents because it can give results from simple sample loading and the used strip can be directly disposed of after treatment with high temperature and pressure. The sensitivity and specificity of traditional immunochromatography methods are often too low because the physical interaction between antibodies and gold particles is fragile, and the results are analyzed by the naked eye. Up-converting phosphor technology-based point-of-care testing (UPT-POCT) as described below are based on the covalent conjugation of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and antibodies, and then the emission signal at 540 nm resulting from excitation at 900 nm can be transmitted into readable electrical signals by biosensors. Therefore, the UPT-LF assay can detect various samples with high sensitivity and specificity, in particular it shows robust performance for complicated samples.",

While UPT-POCT based on the double-antigen sandwich mode is applied for the detection of antibodies against bioterrorism agents, such as antibodies against Y. pestis (Hong et al. 2010) and hepatitis B surface antibody (Li et al. 2009). For example, in the detection of Y. pestis (Fig. 16.1); mouse anti-Y. pestis antibody 1 is immobilized on the nitrocellulose membrane as the test (T) line, while mouse anti-Y. pestis antibody 2 is combined with UCNPs covalently. For positive detection, Y. pestis in samples is captured by UCNPs-mouse antibody 2 conjugates, and then flows forward and is captured by mouse antibody 1 at the T line of the nitrocellulose membrane, forming T line-mouse antibody 1-Y. pestis-mouse antibody 2-UCNPs conjugates. UCNPs can emit visible light signals after excitation by infrared light, and the intensity of the signals is in direct proportion to the concentration of Y. pestis. Whether there are Y. pestis present or not, goat anti-mouse antibody-mouse antibody 2-UCNPs conjugate will be formed on the control (C) line on the nitrocellulose membrane for quality control. The signal ratio between the T and C lines, the T/C ratio, is defined as the detection result, and T/C values increase with the increase in quantity of Y. pestis in the sample. In the double-antigen sandwich mode, bioterrorism antigens, such as F1 antigen of Y. pestis, are dispensed in the T line and combined with UCNPs respectively, and then the corresponding antibody is detected.\n",

Selective culture medium, as well as inoculation and dissection of susceptible animals, are both common experiments. The culture methods for the various bioterrorism agents are different. (1) Bacteria can be identified by selection in selective medium, for example, alkaline peptone water is the medium for selective culture of V. cholerea, while Y. pestis can be identified by culturing with bacteriophage lysis. (2) Isolation of viruses by cell culture is the main method for virus detection because viruses can only survive in live cells. After virus infection the mutated cell can be directly detected by microscopy, or observed through the change in pH of the medium, hemadsorption or hemagglutination. Culture in chick embryo is also common for viruses such as influenza virus. Animal incubations are better than cell incubation for some viruses, for example, inoculation of mice is the best culture method for Rabies virus. (3) Rickettsia bioterrorism-associated agents are cultured and isolated by guinea pig and chick embryo. (4) The types of toxin can be identified by lethality or the animal response after inoculation of susceptible animals or cells, such as vomiting and diarrhea caused by S. aureus enterotoxin B. The susceptible animals for toxins are different, for instance, mouse and cat are sensitive for botulinum toxin and S. aureus enterotoxin, respectively.",

Because of its low sensitivity, the isolation-culture method is often combined with other methods to improve the accuracy of detection, such as the bacteriophage lysis method (Zhao et al. 2013). For example, the bacteriophage lysis method for identification of Y. pestis is realized through adding bacteriophage into cultured bacteria at 18\u201320 \u00b0C.
