Faced with this situation, the need for searching new broad\u2010spectrum antivirals and antibiotics has emerged. Most antibiotics in late\u2010stage clinical development belong to existing antibiotic classes, and a few are new compounds directed against novel targets (Fernandes & Martens, 2017). Blocking cellular pathways used by pathogens in combined therapies against several targets is an interesting strategy to treat viral and bacterial infections while avoiding antiviral or antibiotic resistance.",

In order to generate a larger pool of FA, HCV directly induces the overexpression of FA synthase (FASN), the key multienzyme complex for FA synthesis and therefore GPLs. This is a possible mechanism by which HCV infection alters the cellular lipid profile in liver and causes diseases such as steatosis (Yang et al., 2008). DENV nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) is responsible for FASN recruitment to replication factories (Heaton et al., 2010). After infection, cellular membranes showed a FASN\u2010dependent enrichment in unsaturated phospholipids and lipid signalling molecules such as sphingomyelin (SM; Perera et al., 2012). Two related flaviviruses, WNV and Usutu virus (USUV; Martin\u2010Acebes, Blazquez, Jimenez de Oya, Escribano\u2010Romero, & Saiz, 2011), and the nonrelated alphanodavirus FHV (Kampmueller & Miller, 2005) also showed an RNA replication dependency on FA synthesis.

It catalyses the formation of a cis\u2010double bond at the \u03949 position of stearoyl and palmitoyl\u2010CoA. Brome mosaic virus (BMV) requires unsaturated FAs, and mutations in the host FA desaturases inhibit BMV replication (Lee, Ishikawa, & Ahlquist, 2001).

For some arboviruses, cholesterol plays an important role in the process of virus entry into cells. For example, the Gc structural protein of Rift Valley fever virus directly recognises and binds to GPLs at the plasma membrane. Insertion of Gc is followed by accumulation of cholesterol and local membrane reorganisation (Guardado\u2010Calvo et al., 2017). Depletion of cholesterol and consequent disruption of lipid rafts by methyl\u2010\u03b2\u2010cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD) decreased the infectivity of Newcastle disease virus, WNV, HCV, and bovine parainfluenza virus, mainly through blocking virus entry into cells (Kapadia, Barth, Baumert, McKeating, & Chisari, 2007; Li, Yu, & Hou, 2017; Mackenzie, Khromykh, & Parton, 2007; Martin, Holguera, Sanchez\u2010Felipe, Villar, & Munoz\u2010Barroso, 2012).

This competition reduces the rate by which HMGCR produces mevalonate, the next molecule in the cascade that eventually generates cholesterol (Stancu & Sima, 2001).

Pharmacological inhibition of long\u2010chain acyl\u2010CoA synthetase, diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1, and acyl\u2010CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase results in the blockade of virion assembly and egress (Herker et al., 2010; Liefhebber, Hague, Zhang, Wakelam, & McLauchlan, 2014). Targeting synthesis of lipids stored at LDs might be an alternative for therapeutic treatment of chronic HCV infection. Other host factor involved in the recruitment of HCV to LD is the lipid\u2010modifying phospholipase PLA2G4A (Menzel, 2012).

PI4KIII inhibitors with less toxicity and cross\u2010reactivity with other cellular kinases are currently under consideration (Rutaganira et al., 2016; van der Schaar et al., 2013).",

            "text": "After entering cells, A. phagocytophilum, Brucella, Mycobacterium, Salmonella, Chlamydia, and Coxiella burnetii establish their replicative inclusions in membrane\u2010bound compartments derived from phagosomes or organelles of the endocytic pathway (Alpuche\u2010Aranda, Berthiaume, Mock, Swanson, & Miller, 1995; Heinzen, Scidmore, Rockey, & Hackstadt, 1996; Niu, Yamaguchi, & Rikihisa, 2008; Oh et al., 1996). Although these bacteria lack the genes for cholesterol biosynthesis, cholesterol content increases in infected cells. In particular, Chlamydia spp., C. burnetii, and A. phagocytophilum modulate host cholesterol homeostasis at the level of gene transcription, such as the LDL receptor or the HMGCR (Gilk, 2012; Lin & Rikihisa, 2003). Chlamydia downregulates cholesterol efflux and requires de novo cholesterol synthesis (Bashmakov, Zigangirova, Pashko, Kapotina, & Petyaev, 2010), whereas A. phagocytophilum alters LDL uptake by infected cells and causes a twofold increase of their cholesterol content (Xiong et al., 2009). C. burnetii increases the cholesterol content of infected cells by 70% (Czyz et al., 2014; Howe & Heinzen, 2006). During early stages of infection, the inclusion membrane of C. burnetii has low levels of cholesterol, but at later stages, the amount of cholesterol increases, which suggests a temporal regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake. C. burnetii has been shown to be sensitive to the treatment with statins (Howe & Heinzen, 2006). Mycobacterium and Salmonella do not need lipid rafts for entry, but intracellular cholesterol is important for infection. As mentioned above, Mycobacterium cannot synthesize cholesterol and needs to obtain cholesterol from the host through alternative means such as the mce4 gene cluster and the ABC\u2010like\u2010ATP\u2010dependent system that import cholesterol into bacteria. Disrupting cholesterol metabolism diminishes Mycobacterium entry (Kaul, Anand, & Verma, 2004), replication (de Chastellier & Thilo, 2006; Miner, Chang, Pandey, Sassetti, & Sherman, 2009; Mohn et al., 2008; Parihar et al., 2014; Russell, Cardona, Kim, Allain, & Altare, 2009), and subsequent stages of infection (Nesbitt et al., 2010; Pandey & Sassetti, 2008). Salmonella uses the pathogenicity island 1 and 2 type III secretion systems that localize in the lumen of the inclusion, where they mediate the esterification of cholesterol (Haraga, Ohlson, & Miller, 2008; Nawabi, Catron, & Haldar, 2008). Pharmacological disruption of cholesterol with statins (Catron et al., 2004) or M\u03b2CD (Huang, 2011) reduces intracellular Salmonella growth. Other bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Kowalski & Pier, 2004), Staphylococcus pneumoniae (Bergman et al., 2011), Staphylococcus aureus (Jerwood & Cohen, 2008), Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae (Al\u2010Kuraishy, Al\u2010Gareeb, & Al\u2010Buhadily, 2018) are also susceptible to the treatment with statins. Pharmacological inhibition of cholesterol and genetic depletion experiments confirmed that targeting cholesterol can lead to efficient strategies against all these bacteria by reducing entry and replication in host cells.",

During Mycobacterium infection, Asm contributes to the fusion of the Mycobacterium\u2010containing vacuole with the phagosome, a process that mediates the elimination of bacteria (Vazquez et al., 2016). Mycobacterium avoids this host defence via PI signalling. Thus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis synthesizes glycosylated phosphoinositides such as mannose\u2010capped lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM; Beatty et al., 2000; Fratti, Chua, Vergne, & Deretic, 2003). Furthermore, the phosphatase activity of SapM, MptpB, and MptpA reduces the amount of PtdIns(3)P on the Mycobacterium\u2010containing vacuole surface (Chua & Deretic, 2004). Both ManLAM and phosphatase effectors interfere with phagosomal maturation and degradation of bacteria (Castandet et al., 2005; Singh et al., 2003). Interestingly, Asm is also important for Mycobacterium infection. Pharmacological inhibition of Asm with imipramine (Godbole et al., 2015) and infection in Asm\u2010deficient mice (Utermohlen, Herz, Schramm, & Kronke, 2008) showed that the growth of M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Mycobacterium avium was blocked. Moreover, Asm\u2010deficient mice were more resistant to Mycobacterium lethal infection than wild\u2010type mice. Additionally, both Neisseria and Pseudomonas trigger Asm activation, Cer release, and the assembly of Cer\u2010enriched rafts that are essential for infection (Grassme et al., 1997; Grassme et al., 2003; Hauck et al., 2000). Cer\u2010enriched platforms serve as scaffold for the recruitment of cellular receptors such as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, used by Pseudomonas to enter cells (Schroeder et al., 2002). Deficiency of Asm and specific pharmacological inhibition blocked Neisseria (Grassme et al., 1997; Hauck et al., 2000; Simonis, Hebling, Gulbins, Schneider\u2010Schaulies, & Schubert\u2010Unkmeir, 2014) and Pseudomonas (Becker et al., 2010; Cremesti et al., 2001; Riethmuller et al., 2009) entry and infection. Asm inhibitors were also effective against other bacteria such as S. aureus (Peng et al., 2015) and E. coli (Falcone et al., 2004), demonstrating their potential as broad\u2010spectrum antibiotics.",

These two pathways depend on virulence factors InIA or InIB. InIB interaction with its natural receptor Met (Marino, Braun, Cossart, & Ghosh, 1999; Shen et al., 2000) triggers the activation and translocation of PI3KIA to Listeria monocytogenes entry site. The subsequent signalling cascade produces an increase in lipid products, in particular PI(3,4,5)P3 (Ireton et al., 1996; Ireton, Payrastre, & Cossart, 1999) that recruits effectors for actin reorganisation. PI3K cascade and cytoskeletal rearrangements are critical for L. monocytogenes invasion, and that is why PI3K inhibitors such as wortmannin and LY294002 block infection (Ireton et al., 1996). During Shigella infection, the sites of internalisation colocalize with PI(5)P, which is produced with the participation of the bacterial phosphatase IpgD. The accumulation of PI5P at the plasma membrane reduces tether forces and favours entry. When PI3KI\u2013AKT pathway is activated, the regulation of antiapoptotic effectors is triggered. However, blocking PI3K with wortmannin does not affect Shigella entry, suggesting that PI3KI activity is not involved in invasion but in later steps of infection (Lafont, Tran Van Nhieu, Hanada, Sansonetti, & van der Goot, 2002; Pendaries et al., 2006). A. phagocytophilum also takes advantage of the PI3K\u2013AKT pathway to delay apoptosis, something observed in experiments of PI3K pharmacological inhibition with LY294002 (Khanal, Sultana, Catravas, Carlyon, & Neelakanta, 2017; Sarkar et al., 2012). Brucella also requires both PI3KI and PI3KII activity for entering the cell and replicate (Guzman\u2010Verri et al., 2001). Salmonella can modulate PI\u2010derived signalling at different stages of infection via the bacterial phosphatase effector SopB. By a not well\u2010understood SopB\u2010dependent process, PI3KI converts PI(4,5)P2 to PI(3,4,5)P3 at the plasma membrane and produces a double effect: First, the reduction of interactions between membrane and cytoskeleton leads to bacterial invasion (Terebiznik et al., 2002), and second, the recruitment of AKT activates cell survival pathways that avoid apoptosis. SopB also reduces PI(4,5)P2 and PS levels on the Salmonella vacuole surface, where charge diminishes avoiding the fusion with lysosomes (Bakowski et al., 2010). Another essential SopB function for Salmonella replication is the recruitment of Rab5 and PI3KIII to the inclusion surface, which is required to maintain high levels of PI(3)P (Bujny et al., 2008; Hernandez, Hueffer, Wenk, & Galan, 2004). Two studies (Auweter et al., 2011; Auweter, Yu, Arena, Guttman, & Finlay, 2012) showed that SseL, another Salmonella effector, interacts with the lipid transfer protein OSBP and enhances Salmonella replication, probably by modifying the lipid composition of the replicative vacuole. In contrast, Mycobacterium alters PI(3)P levels by a dual strategy. Mycobacterium encodes different phosphatase effectors to arrest phagosomal maturation and avoid its elimination by reducing the amount of PI(3)P on the Mycobacterium inclusion surface (Castandet et al., 2005; Singh et al., 2003). Mycobacterium also expresses a glycosylated PI analogue, the ManLAM, that inhibits the activation of PI3KIII, the kinase involved in PI(3)P production.",

PI4KII has been shown to be important for Chlamydia and Listeria infection. In addition to PI3K, the activation of PI4KII is required for Listeria invasion, and its blockade impairs entry without perturbing the plasma membrane content in PI (4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 (Pizarro\u2010Cerda et al., 2007). Although the participation of PI4K in Listeria infection is not well understood, these results suggest a postentry signalling role. Legionella modifies PI flows with a number of effectors that interfere with endocytic and secretory pathways and with communication with the ER. Legionella pneumophila hijacks PC and diacylglycerol on the Legionella\u2010containing vacuole membrane (Viner, Chetrit, Ehrlich, & Segal, 2012). Furthermore, it is known that L. pneumophila enriches its inclusion membrane with PI(4)P in a PI4KIII\u2010dependent manner (Brombacher et al., 2009; Weber, Ragaz, Reus, Nyfeler, & Hilbi, 2006). Additionally, treatment with the PI4KIII inhibitor PIK93 reduces L. pneumophila replication (Hubber et al., 2014), confirming the importance of the PI4Ks in Legionella infection. However, the requirement of PI3K in L. pneumophila entry and replication has been a matter of debate (Charpentier et al., 2009; Khelef, Shuman, & Maxfield, 2001; Tachado, Samrakandi, & Cirillo, 2008; Weber et al., 2006). Chlamydia recruits PI4KII\u03b1, has high levels of PI4P in the membrane inclusion, and recruits the lipid transfer protein OSBP in a PI4P\u2010dependent way. Although its role is still unclear, OSBP probably participates in inclusion membrane remodelling by modifying its lipid composition (Moorhead, Jung, Smirnov, Kaufer, & Scidmore, 2010), something that could make Chlamydia sensitive to inhibitors of OSBP.",

Recruitment of NPC1 produces an accumulation of cholesterol in the inclusions of A. phagocytophilum. Moreover, treatment with the NPC1 inhibitor U18666A blocks the transport of cholesterol to the bacterial inclusion and stops bacterial growth, evidencing the essential role of this LTP in infection (Xiong et al., 2009; Xiong & Rikihisa, 2012). In the case of Brucella, lipid rafts are important for the entry of bacteria in the host cell (Watarai, Makino, Michikawa, et al., 2002). Because NPC1 is important for the maintenance of cholesterol\u2010rich lipid rafts, targeting NPC1 blocks Brucella infection. Therefore, NPC1\u2010deficient mice are resistant to Brucella infection (Watarai, Makino, Fujii, et al., 2002). U18666A is efficient also against C. burnetii and Chlamydia trachomatis (Beatty, 2006; Howe & Heinzen, 2006), but the role of NPC1 in infection is still unknown.",

Chlamydia cannot synthesize SLs that are essential for the biogenesis of bacterial inclusions and replication of bacteria (van Ooij et al., 2000). Cryo\u2010electron microscopy and immunogold labelling showed that CERT is recruited to bacterial inclusions. Chlamydia uses CERT to transport Cer from the ER to the bacterial inclusion for SM synthesis (Derre, Swiss, & Agaisse, 2011; Elwell et al., 2011). SM then incorporates into the inclusion membrane and the bacterial cell wall. The compound HPA\u201012 has been reported as a specific CERT inhibitor. However, in CERT\u2010knockout cells, SL transport still works, and HPA\u201012 strongly impairs this transport (Carabeo, Mead, & Hackstadt, 2003; Elwell et al., 2011; Koch\u2010Edelmann et al., 2017).

Lipids are gaining importance as targets for antiviral and antibiotic development. Because many viruses and bacteria use lipids to build neo\u2010organelles for replication and persistence, inhibitors of the synthesis of cholesterol, Cer, SLs, FAs, and phospholipids interfere with growth of many pathogens. Besides, drugs against protein kinases target signalling pathways needed for infection. Figures 1 and 2 summarise current knowledge on host lipid synthesis, transport, and signalling pathways used by viruses and bacteria. Compounds that interfere with these pathways may become efficient antivirals or antibiotics. Moreover, drugs tested against viruses might be efficient also against bacteria and vice versa. Notably, targeting lipid transport may produce less toxic antivirals and antibiotics as intracellular pathogens depend on specific LTPs for making their neo\u2010organelles, although cells may have more than one LTP for the same function. Within this context, high\u2010throughput screening of clinically tested compounds will provide a rapid means to identify undiscovered, antiviral, and antibiotic functions for well\u2010characterized molecules that target lipid metabolism and flows.",

Compounds that interfere with these pathways and have antiviral or antibiotic activity are indicated. (1) Disruption of lipid rafts affects West Nile virus, Newcastle disease virus, human immunodeficiency virus\u20101, and influenza A, bovine parainfluenza, and syncytial viruses and Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella, Mycobacterium avium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Chlamydia trachomatis infection. (2) Inhibition of phospholipase PLA2G4A impairs hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication. (3) Inhibition of 3\u2010hydroxy\u20103\u2010methyl\u2010glutaryl\u2010coenzyme A (HMG\u2010CoA) reductase by statins interferes with infection of many viruses and bacteria such as West Nile virus (WNV), dengue virus (DENV), tomato bushy stunt virus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Coxiella burnetii. (4) Inhibition of acyl\u2010CoA:cholesterol (Ch) acyltransferase (ACAT) blocks infection of HCV and C. trachomatis. (5 and 6) Inhibition of two different steps of triglyceride (TG) synthesis impairs HCV assembly. (7) When fatty acid (FA) synthase (FASN) is inhibited by C75 or cerulenin, replication of WNV, Usutu virus, DENV, and Flock House virus is blocked. (8) Inhibition of FA\u2010desaturase stearoyl\u2010CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) decreases HCV and DENV infectivity. (9) Blockage of ceramide (Cer) synthesis at two different steps impairs replication of viruses such as WNV, HCV, and hepatitis B virus. (10) Inhibition of the lipid transfer protein Cer transfer protein (CERT) impairs HCV particle release and C. trachomatis infection. (11) Inhibition of sphingomyelin (SM) synthase alters HCV viral cycle. (12) Inhibition of sphingomyelinase (Asm) acts as an antibiotic against S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium smegmatis, E. coli, and C. burnetii. (13) HCV replication decreases when treating with uridine diphosphate\u2013glucose Cer synthase (UGCG) synthetic inhibitors. (14) Inhibition of oxysterol\u2010binding protein (OSBP) impairs replication of enterovirus, encephalomyocarditis virus, and HCV. (15) Inhibition of Niemann\u2013Pick type C1 protein (NPC1) impedes the entry of Ebola virus and other filoviruses because NPC1 is the specific cell receptor for these viruses; inhibition of NPC1\u2010mediated Ch transport impairs the replication of DENV, HEV, and HCV viruses and reduces the infection of C. trachomatis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and C. burnetii.

            "text": "Figure 2: Schematic summary of phosphatidylinositol (PI)\u2010derived signalling pathways triggered by bacteria and viruses. Compounds that interfere with these pathways and have antiviral or antibiotic activity are indicated. (1) Listeria uses the InIB effector, which engages with host receptor Met and stimulates the recruitment of PI3KI to the bacterial entry sites. PI3K activation produces PI(3,4,5)P3, resulting in the reorganisation of cytoskeleton favouring the entry of Listeria. Both Listeria and Chlamydia additionally recruit PI4KII\u03b1/\u03b2 to the plasma membrane, where it produces PI(4)P also promoting uptake. (2) Brucella and Salmonella require PI3KI recruitment and activity for entering the cell. Alternately, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Shigella need the subsequent PI3K\u2013AKT pathway to delay apoptosis. Moreover, Shigella's entry site requires an enrichment of PI(5)P stimulated by IpgD. (3) After entry, Chlamydia recruits PI4KII\u03b1 to the inclusion, generating PI(4)P and leading to the recruitment of the lipid transfer protein oxysterol\u2010binding protein (OSBP). (4) Mycobacterium produces the mannose\u2010capped lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM) to interfere with PI3KIII activity. Disruption of PI3KIII reduces the amounts of PI(3)P on the inclusion surface and avoids phagosomal maturation. (5) Recruitment of PI4KIII\u03b2 and OCRL1 together with the hijacking of the secretory pathway enriches Legionella inclusion in PI(4)P. (6) The Salmonella effector SopB recruits PI3KIII to the inclusion surface to maintain high levels of PI(3)P. The SseL effector binds to OSBP, which is recruited to the inclusion periphery. (7) Many different viruses recruit and exploit host PI4KIII kinases to build viral factories within reorganised cell membranes. Hepatitis C virus and encephalomyocarditis virus remodel endoplasmic reticulum membranes to build replication organelles with the assistance of PI4KIII\u03b1 that generates PI(4)P at the replication sites. In a similar manner, PI4KIII\u03b2 is used by other viruses such as picornaviruses, enteroviruses, Coxsackievirus B3, and human rhinoviruses",
