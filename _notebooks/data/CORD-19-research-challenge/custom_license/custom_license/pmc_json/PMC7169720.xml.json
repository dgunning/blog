A total of 197 different 15\u2010mer peptides (>70%) possessing 5\u2010amino acid overlap sequences based on the full genomic sequences of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV), including 125 spike (S), 43 nucleocapsid (N), 22 membrane (M) and seven envelope (E) proteins (3), were purchased from American Peptide Company, Inc. (Vista, CA). Each peptide was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and was then stored at \u221220\u00b0C until use. These peptides were tested for their reactivity to the sera of early stages of three Taiwanese SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected patients by using flowmetry analysis with LuminexTM (Luminex Corp., Austin, TX) (9). The sera were collected from Jen\u2010Ai Municipal Hospital, SaAn District, Taipei, Taiwan. The patients' sera showed significantly higher levels of immunoglobulin\u2010G (IgG) (P < 0.05) activities reactive to 42 of 197 peptides tested, including 20 spike (S)\u2010, seven membrane (M)\u2010 and 15 nucleocapsid (N)\u2010derived peptides, when the means of the scores of fluorescence intensity (FI) from the sera (1000\u2010fold dilution) of the three patients (closed bar) were compared to those of the three healthy donors (HD) (open bar). The peptides were coupled to colour\u2010coded beads, according to the modified manufacturer's instructions (Luminex Corp.). In brief, 100 \u00b5l of colour\u2010coded beads were mixed with 100 \u00b5l of peptide (1 mg/ml in 0.1 M morpholinoehanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer, pH 4.5). The peptide\u2010loaded beads were then incubated with 1\u2010ethyl\u20103\u2010[3\u2010dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide 2\u2010(N\u2010Morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (EDC) (1 mg ml\u22121) at room temperature for 30 min in darkness, and the beads were washed with Tween\u201020 phosphate\u2010buffered saline (PBS). The beads were treated with 2\u2010aminoethanol for 10 min at room temperature in darkness, washed twice and then re\u2010suspended with 1 ml of 0.05% Block Ace (Snow Brand Milk Products Co., Ltd, Hokkaido, Japan) in Tween\u201020 PBS. Two microlitres of serum at dilutions of 100\u201310,000 times was incubated with 25 \u00b5l of the peptide\u2010coupled colour\u2010coded beads for 2 h at room temperature on a plate shaker in a 96\u2010well filter plate (MultiScreenTM\u2010BV, Millipore Co., Bedford, MA). After incubation, the plate was washed by using a vacuum manifold apparatus and was incubated with 100 \u00b5l of biotinylated goat anti\u2010human IgG (gamma\u2010chain\u2010specific: Vector Laboratory Inc., Burlingame, CA) for 1 h at room temperature on a plate shaker. The plate was then washed, and 100 \u00b5l of streptavidin\u2010PE (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added into wells, followed by incubation for 30 min at room temperature on a plate shaker. The bound beads were washed three times followed by the addition of 100 \u00b5l of Tween\u201020 PBS into each well, and the plate was placed for 3 min on a plate shaker. Fifty microlitres of sample was analysed by using the Luminex\u2122 system with the help of the method reported previously (9, 13, 15).",

The 42 peptides shown in Fig. 1 were tested for their reactivity to sera from post\u2010infection (6th month) patients with the Vietnamese SARS\u2010CoV infection (n = 45). As negative controls, the sera of both Vietnamese healthy donors (V\u2010HD) (n = 50) and the contact persons (CP), who were free from illness of SARS\u2010CoV infection but worked in the same hospitals, were tested. Sera from Japanese patients with hepatitis\u2010C virus (HCV), influenza (Flu), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), along with Japanese HD (J\u2010HD), were also tested at the same times at a serum dilution of 1 : 100. Representative results of the fluorescence intensity (FI) scores at a serum dilution of 100 : 1 of anti\u2010S791, anti\u2010M207 and anti\u2010N161 activities have been shown in this figure. The significance of the differences (*P < 0.05) in Luminex reactivities of SARS patients against all of other negative control groups, including V\u2010HD, CP, J\u2010HD, Flu, HCV, RA and SLE, was observed by means of Mann\u2013Whitney test. Plasma from 78 Vietnamese post\u2010infection (6th month, n = 45) SARS\u2010CoV patients was collected at Hanoi French Hospital and Bach Mai Hospital in Vietnam. All cases met a modified World Health Organization (WHO) case definition of SARS (16). This study was approved by both the Japanese and Vietnamese Institutional Review Board. Written informed consent was obtained from each of the participants. Sera from Japanese patients with Flu (n = 12), HCV (n = 12), RA (n = 15) and SLE (n = 10) and Japanese healthy donors (J\u2010HD, n = 27) were provided by Kurume University Hospital and Kurume Medical Center after informed consent was obtained.

The method for the preparation of immobilized peptides was the same as the method used for ELISA plate preparation, as described in the legend of Fig. 4. The results of the absorption test were analysed by means of a two\u2010tailed Student's t\u2010test. All tests of significance were two\u2010sided. In order to test the specificity of anti\u2010peptide IgG in the serum samples, 100 \u00b5l/well of serum samples (1 : 100 dilution with 0.05% PBST) was absorbed with the immobilized peptide (200 \u00b5g/well: closed bar or 40 \u00b5g/well: open bar, as final concentrations) in wells kept for 2 h at room temperature.
