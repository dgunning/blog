However, the function of HBx on the mitochondrial outer membrane has not been well evaluated. As the exact function of HBx on the mitochondrial membrane is challenging to evaluate in cells, we attempted to investigate HBx function using a recombinant HBx protein and an artificial membrane system. We synthesized recombinant HBx protein in E. coli and recovered its biological activity through a rational refolding method, as previously reported.17 The purity of the refolded recombinant HBx protein was examined via Coomassie blue staining (>95%), and it was further confirmed by anti\u2010HBx and anti\u2010His antibodies (Figure 1A,B). As HBx was shown to be inserted into the mitochondrial outer membrane via its transmembrane domain (residues 53\u201070), we generated liposomes with a rat liver mitochondrial outer membrane composition, as previously reported.18, 19 To observe the HBx localization in liposomes, we prepared mitochondrial outer membrane\u2010mimic giant unilamellar vesicles (MOM\u2010GUVs) including ATTO 390\u2010DOPE. We treated the recombinant HBx protein for 2 minutes, and HBx\u2010targeted MOM\u2010GUVs were then stained with nickel\u2010nitrilotriacetate conjugated to ATTO 488 fluorescent dye (NTA\u2010ATTO 488) for the detection of poly\u2010His\u2010tagged HBx by fluorescence microscopy.

Loss of contrast around MOM\u2010GUVs was further analysed by line profiling (Figure 2C). Because MOM\u2010GUVs were prepared with 200 mmol L\u22121 sorbitol solution and added to the external buffer containing 100 mmol L\u22121 KCl and 10 mmol L\u22121 HEPES/KOH (pH 7.4), this transparency phenomenon implies that the refractive index of the internal solution of MOM\u2010GUVs became equal to that of the external buffer.

One of these organelles is the mitochondrion, and the modulation of this organelle is indispensable for the viral life cycle.26 Mitochondria have a diverse set of functions including energy production, apoptosis and metabolite supply.27 One of the main events during apoptosis is mitochondrial depolarization, which is caused by the opening of a permeability transition (PT) pore.20 The PT pore includes adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) protein, voltage\u2010dependent anion channel (VDAC) protein and matrix cyclophilin D protein.28 A variety of viruses control the PT pore to trigger apoptosis. The influenza A virus PB1\u2010F2 protein interacts with VDAC1 and ANT3 to decrease mitochondrial membrane permeability (MMP), inducing apoptosis by the release of pro\u2010apoptotic proteins.29 The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV\u20101) viral protein R (Vpr), the Walleye dermal sarcoma virus Orf C protein and the human T\u2010lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV\u20101) p13II protein have all been reported to localize in the mitochondria and modulate mitochondrial proteins to induce apoptosis.30, 31, 32 In contrast, some viruses directly induce mitochondrial depolarization through viral\u2010encoded viroporins. HCV p7, human T\u2010cell leukaemia virus type 1 (HTLV\u20101) p13 and picornavirus 2B proteins detected in mitochondria all induce mitochondrial depolarization.33, 34 In the case of HCV p7, the protein forms hexameric complexes that act as ion channels permeable to cations to enhance the entry and escape of viral particles.19, 35, 36 HBx also reduces the transmembrane potential and induces apoptosis by interacting with VDAC3.20 HBx mainly has been studied in terms of its regulation of signalling cascades, including its interaction with several cellular proteins.",

This effect was inhibited by a viroporin inhibitor and by nonselective cation channel blockers (Figure 4). As an artificial membrane system without any cellular proteins was used, we hypothesize that this membrane permeabilization is mediated by HBx only. We excluded the possibility of HBx as an ion channel protein (viroporin) because its predicted secondary structure is far different from that of the viroporins, which have 1 or 2 alpha\u2010helical transmembrane domains. We questioned the means by which HBx could trigger membrane permeabilization in this artificial liposome system, but to elucidate the exact mechanism, more extensive studies are required. However, we suggest 1 possibility based on the previous studies in which cytochrome c, the protein of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, was reported to induce membrane permeabilization and it shows (or was suggested to have) the \u201cchannel\u2010pore dualism,\u201d which is regarded as a viroporin phenomenon.37, 38 We found that HBx permeated CF, which has a 0.6\u2010nm Stokes radius (Figure 3). However, HBx is not classified as an ion channel protein.38 Cytochrome c interacts with specific lipids of the mitochondrial inner membrane to induce lipid pore formation.38 It was thus shown to induce membrane permeabilization, releasing CF and 10\u2010kDa dextran from liposomes. It has been proposed that the hydrophobic region of cytochrome c affects the formation of lipid pores by its insertion into the acyl chains of the lipid bilayer. It is possible that HBx forms a protein\u2010lipid pore with viroporin\u2010like activity, and that it induces membrane permeabilization similar to cytochrome c. Consistent with the structural features of cytochrome c, HBx also has a hydrophobic region (residues 54\u201070) that may serve as a transmembrane domain for insertion into the mitochondrial outer membrane. It is possible that membrane permeabilization by HBx is similar to that of cytochrome c. These results indicate that HBx may form a nonselective pore to pass ions and small molecules through the mitochondrial outer membrane. However, the mitochondrial outer membrane has a permeability threshold that allows molecules below 1.5 kDa to pass via pore\u2010forming channels (such as those created by VDAC).39 While these pore\u2010forming channels are regulated by various cellular factors, HBx\u2010induced mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization may not be modulated, thereby inducing uncontrolled membrane permeabilization followed by cell death. Subsequent studies are needed to determine the way in which HBx directly or indirectly affects mitochondrial outer membrane permeability.",

From the combined results, we can suggest that the NN\u2010DNJ effect on HBV may be related to membrane permeabilization by HBx, and additional experiments to support this hypothesis are needed. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that HBx induces membrane permeabilization, and that this effect is inhibited by 1 viroporin inhibitor and by 2 triply\u2010charged lanthanides. It is possible that other viroporin inhibitors or nonselective channel blockers also inhibit HBx activity.
