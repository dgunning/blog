They are connected via a \u22121 ribosomal frameshift during translation. The upstream ORF1a encodes polyprotein pp1a, while ORF1a and ORF1b together encode pp1ab. The replicase polyprotein is further cleaved by viral proteinases to yield 15 nonstructural proteins (nsp2\u2013nsp16), which assemble into the replicase complex that is required for viral replication and transcription (Snijder et al., 2003 \u25b6; Prentice et al., 2004 \u25b6).",

The gene encoding the IBV nsp2 N-terminal domain (residues 9\u2013393 of the polyprotein) was cloned by PCR and inserted between the BamHI and XhoI sites of the pGEX-6p-1 plasmid (GE Healthcare). The forward and reverse PCR primers used for amplification were IBV-nsp2N-F (5\u2032-CGGGATCCATGGTATCTCCCAAACTAAGGG-3\u2032) and IBV-nsp2N-R (5\u2032-CCGCTC\u00adGAGTTAACTAAAAGAAGAGTAGATTG-3\u2032). The resulting construct was sequenced to ensure that no mutations had occurred during amplification. The double mutant was generated by using the PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis method twice. The primers used to generate the nucleic acid mutant were IBV-nsp2N-Q132L-F (5\u2032-CTGGATGCTCGTGCACTAACTCTTGATG-3\u2032), IBV-nsp2N-Q132L-R (5\u2032-TGCACGAGCATCCAGTGTTTCTACA-3\u2032), IBV-nsp2N-L270F-F (5\u2032-AAAATTTTCACTACATTTGCCTTCTTTA-3\u2032) and IBV-nsp2N-L270F-R (5\u2032-TGTAGTGAAAATTTTAGCACCC\u00adATG-3\u2032). DNA sequencing confirmed that only the appropriate mutation was incorporated into the construct. The resulting plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and the cells were cultured in LB medium containing 0.1 mg ml\u22121 ampicillin at 310 K until the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) reached 0.6. 0.2 mM isopropyl \u03b2-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was then added and the cultures were induced for 16 h at 289 K. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000 rev min\u22121 for 10 min) and resuspended in PBS buffer (140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4 pH 7.3) supplemented with 1 mM DTT. After sonication at 277 K, the lysate was centrifuged at 15 000 rev min\u22121 for 30 min at 277 K and the precipitate was discarded. The recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein, namely the GST-nsp2 N-\u00adterminal domain, was obtained in the supernatant. The supernatant was then loaded onto 2 ml GST-glutathione affinity columns (GE Healthcare) and the GST tag was cleaved by Pre-Scission protease (GE Healthcare) to produce the nsp2 N-terminal domain. Size-exclusion chromatography was performed using Superdex 75 (GE Healthcare, USA) in 20 mM MES, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT pH 6.0. The purified protein was concentrated to 20 mg ml\u22121 by ultracentrifugation and was ready for crystallization screening.",

The data were processed, integrated, scaled and merged using the HKL-2000 programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997 \u25b6). The crystals diffracted to 2.5 \u00c5 resolution and belonged to space group P62 or P64, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 114.2, c = 61.0 \u00c5, \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 90, \u03b3 = 120\u00b0. Each asymmetric unit contained one molecule, with 53.9% solvent content, from analysis of the Matthews coefficient (Matthews, 1968 \u25b6). The data-collection statistics are given in Table 1 \u25b6. In order to solve the phase problem, we are preparing crystals of the selenomethionyl (SeMet) derivative of the IBV nsp2 N-terminal domain in an attempt to use single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) or multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method to solve the structure. Further structural and functional analysis of the IBV nsp2 N-terminal domain will shed light on how early viral infection by IBV takes place.",
