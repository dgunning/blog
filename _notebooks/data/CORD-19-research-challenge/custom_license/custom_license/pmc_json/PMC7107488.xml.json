Viral culture (Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, diploid lung fibroblasts) and multiplex tandem polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to detect all viruses except picornaviruses and hMPV [14, 15]. Picornaviruses were detected by using nested PCR [16] targeting the 5\u2032 untranslated region of the picornavirus genome, and sequencing was used to assist with the identification of rhinoviruses and enteroviruses. hMPV was tested by using an immunofluorescent assay (SimulFluor hMPV immunofluorescent assay [Millipore, Temecula, California]) and PCR. All patients were subjected to the same panel of tests, and testing methods were consistent throughout the study period with the exception of testing for hMPV, which was based on clinical need.

Infection with specific pathogen pairs might be associated with an increased probability of hospitalization, as was observed with influenza and RSV. This finding has implications in pediatric healthcare facilities, where the isolation of all children with acute respiratory viral infection is difficult during periods of peak respiratory virus activity and cohorting of children is frequently required before the availability of diagnostic test results.",

This result corroborates data from our recently completed systematic review in which we specifically investigated clinical outcomes in children with codetection; we found no differences overall, but the results suggest that some pathogen-specific effects might be present [20].

In contrast, the results of studies on the role of enteroviruses in ARTI are suggestive of pathogenicity [21]; however, the numbers in those studies were small. For these reasons, detections of both viruses were excluded from the analyses presented here.
