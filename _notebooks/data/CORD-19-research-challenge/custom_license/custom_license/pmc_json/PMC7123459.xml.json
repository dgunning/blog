            "text": "Animal societies consist of many individuals that must interact to coordinate their actions. The cohesion of such groups is typically achieved through a distributed network of short-range \u2018direct\u2019 interactions between neighbouring individuals. These serve to rapidly transmit information throughout the group [61, 92]. Short-range contacts also represent a channel for the transmission of harmful pathogens, with the potential for large-scale epidemics being closely linked to the structure of the group interaction network [72, 77, 80, 81, 89]. Whilst information often spreads via dedicated interactions that have evolved for the purpose of communication, diseases often \u2018piggyback\u2019 over a diverse range of different interaction types that have evolved for other purposes, such as sexual contacts [67, 86] or face-to-face conversations [96, 107]. Furthermore, while information and disease play different roles, they may both be viewed as \u2018signals\u2019 that can be transmitted across a group. Although direct interactions based on physical contact are the most obvious means by which such signals can spread, other forms of transmission are possible. For example, some signals remain viable after being deposited into the environment. If such a signal is still viable when that location is later visited by another individual, then the second individual could acquire the signal. As this pathway does not require the sender and receiver to be present at the same time, this is termed \u2018indirect\u2019 transmission [23, 38, 84].",

It is found in species where individuals are generally solitary (Fig. 2.1a), as well as in highly cooperative species where individuals live together in tightly-knit societies (Fig. 2.1b\u2013e). A commonly used example is that of pheromone trails in ant colonies where individual workers deposit chemical markers that recruit nestmates to rewarding food sources [30] (Fig. 2.1c). Disease can also exploit indirect pathways for transmission. Pathogens such as smallpox and influenza are able to remain intact outside a host for extended periods of time in \u2018environmental reservoirs\u2019 (Fig. 2.1f). These increase the number of opportunities for transmission and can lead to multiple waves of infection. Whilst researchers of animal behaviour have long appreciated that the shared environment can act as a substrate for indirect communication [29, 32, 46, 73, 98, 115], epidemiologists are only starting to quantify the important role that indirect transmission has during disease spread [2, 19, 28, 58, 87, 88, 103, 114, 116].\n\n",

Similarly, there has been a rapid growth in the effort devoted to understanding how adaptive collective behaviours such as swarming, flocking and shoaling [6, 22, 74, 92] emerge from the underlying peer-to-peer interactions. To date, these studies have exclusively focused on the role of direct interactions, without considering the potential for indirect transmission of materials or information. Although there are many species in which environmentally-mediated transmission is not viable because the environment cannot physically support such transmission (e.g. flocking birds), there are many species for which the potential is clear (e.g. those living within or upon the ground).",

Individuals are represented by nodes and weighted edges represent direct and indirect interactions (Fig. 2.2a). When a direct physical interaction occurs between two individuals, an edge with a weight of 1 is drawn between them. As both individuals are at the same place at the same time, they may both play the role of either sender or receiver, hence the edge is bidirectional. In contrast, indirect interactions occur when an individual j visits a location previously visited by another individual i. Assuming that i carries some signal (information or disease) that it deposits into the environment, that the signal decays at a rate \u03b1, and that j visits the location at time t, this indirect interaction is represented by a directed edge from i to j with weight, 2.1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$\\displaystyle{ \\omega _{i\\rightarrow j}(t) = e^{-\\alpha \\tau _{i\\rightarrow j}(t)}. }$$\n\\end{document}\u03c9i\u2192j(t)=e\u2212\u03b1\u03c4i\u2192j(t). Here, \u03c4\ni \u2192 j(t) is the time delay between the visits of i and j, which is used to calculate the proportion of the signal that would remain viable given its environmental decay (Fig. 2.2b). This formalism allows any given time point to be represented as a static network \u2018slice\u2019 consisting of both strongly weighted direct interactions and more weekly weighted indirect interactions. Over time edges are created and destroyed. Direct edges appear and disappear whenever two agents make and break contact. An indirect edge appears when one agent (the receiver) visits a location that was previously visited by another agent (the sender), and disappears when the receiving agent leaves that location. As such events are intermittent, the instantaneous static network slices are typically sparse. The overall network structure consists of a sequence of static slices, with direct interactions linking nodes within each slice, and with indirect edges linking nodes between slices. In the literature, such networks have been referred to as multi-slice, multiplex, dynamic, time-ordered, and temporal.\n\n",

Trajectories of individual worker ants were collected and used to create temporal networks where edges represented the direct and indirect interactions between the workers (referred to as \u2018combined\u2019 networks). To investigate the transmission properties of these temporal networks, we ran simulations inspired by susceptible-infected (SI) models of epidemiological processes [52, 54]. In addition to simulating disease spread, SI models and their variants have been used to simulate transmission processes over a wide range of social and technological networks, including infrastructure networks [4], email and mobile phone call records [59, 62], and face-to-face conversation logs [56, 107]. In an SI model each individual may take one of two states; infected (I) or susceptible (S). Once an individual is infected it carries the signal of interest. The model is initiated with one node infected, and all others susceptible. To represent transmission between individuals, an infected individual i that interacts (either directly or indirectly) with a susceptible individual j, may result in j changing its state to infected. The probability that this state-change occurs is given by, 2.2\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$\\displaystyle{ \\mathrm{Pr}(j \\rightarrow I\\mid i \\in I \\wedge j \\in S) = p_{s}\\omega _{i\\rightarrow j}(t), }$$\n\\end{document}Pr(j\u2192I\u2223i\u2208I\u2227j\u2208S)=ps\u03c9i\u2192j(t), where p\ns is the transmission probability for direct interactions, and \u03c9\ni \u2192 j(t) is the edge weight defined above.

In such cases, a small decay rate is essential, otherwise the territory-holder would need to allocate all of their time to re-marking. Whilst data concerning the environmental persistence of such signals is scarce, the prions that cause Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) in deer can persist in the environment for several years [2], and the visual scratch marks used by some vertebrates to indicate territory borders (Fig. 2.1a) are essentially permanent (i.e. \u03b1 \u2248 0). Similarly, the scent- and scat-marks made by other vertebrates [25, 79] to indicate territory (Fig. 2.1b) and the pheromone marks used by invertebrates [57, 64] for communication (Fig. 2.1c), typically dissipate after a few days or weeks, and therefore correspond to signals with intermediate values of \u03b1. At the other end of the scale, there are many examples of pathogens that decay so quickly that they cannot readily persist within the environment at all, and are therefore constrained to spreading by direct interactions (i.e. \u03b1 = \u221e). Most sexually-transmitted diseases fall into this category.",

Therefore, we were not able to provide a causal understanding of how individual-level behaviours determine the transmission properties of the overall interaction network. In this chapter, we overcome this limitation by defining an agent-based model in which the movement of virtual individuals (referred to as \u2018agents\u2019) is systematically varied. The motion of each agent takes the form of a parameterisable two-dimensional random walk. The environment within which these move also contains a spatially-explicit \u2018signal field\u2019 representing signals deposited by infected agents. This field is dynamically updated to reflect signal decay. By feeding the interaction data produced by this more physically realistic agent-based model into our previous network abstraction [84], we are able to establish a causal link between the behaviours of the individuals and the emergent group-level transmission properties.",

However, many simplifying assumptions are often made to ensure a tractable solution. For this reason, these models generally use deterministic differential equations to represent the flux of individuals between different states and assume that the population is infinite and well-mixed [66]. These simplifications are often not a good approximation for real-world systems where a finite number of individuals are non-uniformly distributed across space and behave stochastically rather than deterministically [7]. Furthermore, the physical laws governing real-world environments impose severe limits on how individuals can move and interact, yet compartment models assume no such constraints. Some attempts have been made to extend this approach to incorporate network structures that capture the heterogeneous mixing of populations, but generally such changes come at the cost of reduced analytical tractability.",

Nodes represent individuals and edges capture the interactions or contacts between them [15]. Although space is not explicitly modelled, the ability to constrain the interactions present between individuals allows for the effective description of the heterogeneous connectivity observed in many real-world systems (e.g. long-tailed degree distributions [9\u201311]). This has lead to network-based approaches becoming common not only in epidemiology, but in a huge variety of different fields where contagious processes are observed, from the spread of rumours and gossip over social networks [68, 93], to cascading failures in power distribution networks [4, 20]. Attempts have also been made to combine the benefits of network models with other modelling approaches. For example, the GLobal Epidemic and Mobility (GLEaM) model makes use of structured metapopulation simulations that are linked to realistic networks capturing known mobility links (e.g. train and airline routes). Simulations using this combined model are able to accurately simulate the spatial propagation of disease pandemics at both regional and global scales [4, 5, 112].",

Doing so ignores the fact that in almost every real-world system the connectivity between individuals varies with time. For example, studies of the contact networks of both humans and other animals, have shown that interactions can be \u2019bursty\u2019 [9] or even cyclical [85], with large numbers of interactions concentrated in a short period of time. In cases where the dynamics of the epidemic process is much slower than the evolution of the network, this is not a problem as time-scale separation makes it possible to consider an \u2018annealed\u2019 network describing the averaged structure the process will encounter [113]. However, if the process has a similar time-scale to the network dynamics, it is essential that both these aspects are modelled concurrently. Temporal networks are well suited to describing such intermittent fluctuations, as they represent the dynamics as a sequence of static network slices [15, 43, 53, 54]. Other approaches have also been developed to describe networks with dynamic topologies. Adaptive networks [49] and evolving dynamic networks [27, 43] make use of dynamical equations and stochastic rules to describe how the strength of each edge varies with time, whilst also allowing for changes in the size of the network through the birth and death of nodes. Although these more complex approaches can capture an even richer range of behaviours, they are a challenge to apply to real-world systems because a unified and accepted theory of time-varying networks is still emerging and new forms of analysis are often required [44].",

As an agent-based model is essentially a physical representation of a given system, it is considerably more detailed than the compartmental and network abstractions described above. Agents can be used to represent any autonomous entity, from cells [45] to animals [110]. Each agent typically follows a prescribed set of rules controlling their behaviour and interactions with their peers. In a cellular context, these rules might represent the genetic circuits that control the expression of key genes in response to particular stimuli [71, 109], whereas in the context of shoals of fish or swarms of insects they would embody the behavioural responses each member makes in response to neighbouring individuals [22].\n",

By varying the rules that agents follow and observing the changes in the group-level behaviours, it is possible to understand how these organisational levels are linked and the causal factors controlling them. It is important to note that by representing the discrete individuals in a system, we are able to capture features that averaging across the population would miss. For example, cells often exploit noise and stochastic effects to differentiate their behaviours. A famous example of this is the lac operon that encodes genes required for the transport and metabolism of lactose [78]. In this system, cells that are genetically homogeneous use stochastic noise to differentiate themselves into two separate populations: those that are active and strongly expressing the lac operon, and those that are not. The fraction of cells in an active state varies depending on the concentration of lactose. However, two separate populations are always maintained. If an average of lac operon expression was taken across the entire population, it would look as if each cell was tuning its expression to match the concentration. Only when the individual cells are modelled, as is done when using agent-based modelling, is a accurate understanding of the bistable structure of the system gained.",

This allowed us to constrain the motion of each individual to a limited region of space.

The bias of the distribution around the mean was then given by \u03ba = d\na\n\u03b3, where d\na is the distance between the agent and the point of attraction, and \u03b3 is a parameter governing the strength of attraction (Table 2.1).

Therefore, we optionally allow for the inclusion of physical collisions between agents.

Sigmoidal curves are a hallmark of density-dependent processes, such as the spread of information or disease through a finite population. The early explosive growth is due to the exponential nature of the SI dynamics where contact between one infected and one susceptible agent can result in two infected agents. The later slowing of spread arises from the gradual depletion of the pool of uninfected agents. To compare the transmission among different types of signals, it is necessary to define a feature of each growth curve that reflects the overall transmission speed. We chose to use the time taken for 50% of the population to become infected to define the characteristic time of infection t\nc. Larger t\nc values correspond to slower transmission through a population. In order to more easily assess the size of changes in transmission, we normalized (divided) the t\nc for the combined networks by the respective t\nc times for the direct-only networks. This provided a fold change in the t\nc value that could then be compared for all signal decay rates \u03b1 and transmission probabilities p\ns (Fig. 2.4d). Positive log fold changes would indicate that collisions lead to a slower transmission, whereas negative values correspond to an accelerated transmission rate.\n",

When direct interactions are possible, the transmission rate is fully dependent on the rate of physical contacts generated by the random walks performed by each member of the population to transmit the signal. Moreover, this rate scales linearly as the number of infected individuals grows. In contrast, when indirect transmission becomes possible because an infected agent deposits a signal into the environment, the effective area for indirect transmission grows. It is as though the size of the agent grows over time, and has the effect of increasing the number of interactions, and therefore the connectivity, of infected agents. For fast decaying signals, this effect will be constrained as the signal trail will be of a limited length (see Fig. 2.4a, \u03b1 = 0. 1 top panels). However, if the decay rate of a signal is sufficiently small, the trail will continue to grow enabling the entire environment to quickly become a potential transmission pathway, even though the infected agents only take up a small fraction of the total area (see Fig. 2.4a, \u03b1 = 0. 001 top panels). In all cases, the increased connectivity that is gained by the indirect pathways will lower the overall diameter of the interaction network and help accelerate transmission [84].",

            "text": "Another major factor influencing the interaction rate between individuals in a group is their density. To assess how the density of individuals affects the rate of transmission, we produced combined networks from the agent based simulations as before, but with 10, 50 and 250 agents. As the size of the environment was fixed, the agent density varied over an order of magnitude (0.3\u20138% of the total area). For all agent densities, we again found that the transmission speed over combined networks was increased relative to networks composed of direct edges; signals with a low transmission probability and small decay rate saw the greatest enhancement in transmission for the combined networks (Fig. 2.5). Furthermore, the agent density also modulated the magnitude of the transmission enhancement brought about by the addition of indirect edges; at low agent densities, the strength of the enhancement was maximal (Fig. 2.5, N = 10), whereas at high agent densities the enhancement was weaker (Fig. 2.5, N = 250). In the case of a slow decaying signal with high transmission probability (\u03b1 = 0. 001, p\ns = 1. 0), the difference in t\nc between direct and combined networks rose from 1.4-fold to 2.3-fold for 250 to 10 agents, respectively. This suggests that the beneficial role of indirect pathways has a greater impact when agents are sparse, raising the interesting possibility that natural populations broadly distributed in space will more heavily rely on indirect transmission pathways [25].\n\n",

The aim was to investigate how individual-level spatial preferences influence transmission of a signal across the population. We hypothesized that compared to a population in which all agents perform random walks, a population of agents that exhibit spatial fidelity should display slower transmission over the group-level interaction network. This is because a system composed of spatially constrained agents should intuitively be dominated by short-range local interactions. Put another way, when each agent interacts with only a small set of nearest neighbours, transmission should be slower than when agents move freely as then all agents can potentially interact with all other agents.",

Simulations were then run for various territory sizes by varying the strength of attraction \u03b3. This resulted in a range of agent movement, from distinct territories formed by agents that remained very close to their point of attraction (\u03b3 = 0. 2), to nearly non-existent territories formed by agents that were only slightly attracted to their point of attraction, and which therefore moved much like a random walker (\u03b3 = 0. 001).

This confirmed our hypothesis that spatially structured populations (i.e. those where an agent\u2019s movement is spatially restricted) also experience reduced transmission speeds. We also found that this increase was greater for signals with lower transmission probabilities and larger decay rates. Under these conditions, agents were so highly constrained to the vicinity of their point of attraction that they only had very limited connectivity to their nearest neighbours (Fig. 2.6a). This led to interaction networks that were highly compartmentalised with multiple sparsely connected components (Fig. 2.6b). These features reduce mixing of the agents and hamper the ability for a signal to propagate throughout the entire population [95] (Fig. 2.6c).",

Interestingly, for intermediate strengths of attraction (\u03b3 = 0. 05), both decreases and increases in transmission speed were observed, depending on the signal transmission and decay characteristics (Fig. 2.6c). Slower transmission was found when signals had large decay rates (\u03b1 = 1) and low transmission probabilities (p\ns = 0. 01). Such signals will find it difficult to exploit indirect pathways.

            "text": "The presence of both enhancement and inhibition of transmission at intermediate attraction strengths can be explained by considering the relation between the average number of interaction partners of each agent (their degree), and the average strength of their interactions (edge weights). At low attraction strengths (\u03b3 = 0. 001), agents can move freely throughout the entire environment (Fig. 2.6a, right panel). This allows them to interact with potentially all other agents, but on average it results in weak interactions between any given pair of agents. This produces interaction networks in which agents have a high degree with many long-range links (i.e. links between agents with points of attraction very far from each other), but where the majority of these links are weak (Fig. 2.6c, right panel). In contrast, intermediate attraction strengths (\u03b3 = 0. 05) lead to the formation of territories that significantly overlap with all nearest neighbours, and potentially more distant agents (Fig. 2.6a, middle panel). In this scenario, an agent\u2019s movement is restricted to a much smaller area, resulting in a greater number of repeated interactions with neighbours over shorter periods of time. This generates an interaction network where each agent is connected by strongly weighted edges to it\u2019s neighbours (Fig. 2.6c, middle panel). Varying the attraction strength alters the size of the territory and so also the number of neighbours it includes. However, as the attraction strength is reduced the potential area for movement also increases. This reduces the interaction rate between the agents and thus leads to an interaction network containing weaker edge strengths. Optimal transmission rates are achieved by trading-off these factors to generate a network in which the weighted diameter is minimised, which occurs when the shortest paths between agent pairs typically consist of a small number of strongly weighted edges.",

This is in stark contrast to when collisions are absent, where infected agents can move throughout the environment to generate direct and indirect interactions with all other members of the population. As described previously, such increased mixing greatly reduces the overall diameter of the network and increases transmission speeds [84]. Long-range interactions also allow for a signal to be seeded at many different locations within the environment, leading to a rapid transmission across the entire population (Fig. 2.7c). Conversely, when collisions are present individuals become confined to a local area due to physical exclusion by nearby agents, hence an infected individual can only infect its nearest neighbours (Fig. 2.7c). At the highest densities, the interaction network is essentially a direct reflection of the agents\u2019 spatial locations, with the all edges reflecting short-range interactions between immediate neighbours. Such networks only allow transmission in the form of a moving infection \u2018front\u2019 passing through the densely-packed population. This limits the role of indirect transmission in \u2018seeding\u2019 infections in new areas and results in a slowing-down of transmission.",

In previous work, we applied a dynamic network methodology to an empirical dataset describing the movement and interactions of individual ants living within a communal nest [84]. However, because the behaviour of individuals could only be observed and not controlled, it was impossible to establish a direct link between individual-level behaviours and group-level transmission properties. Here, we used an agent-based model to simulate populations of individuals whose behaviour can be precisely controlled. This allowed for direct links to be made between an individual\u2019s behaviour (e.g. movement), environmental factors (e.g. signal decay rate, agent density and physical collisions), and transmission properties of the system.",

Both individual behaviour and group density also play an important role in the transmission capabilities of the group. Higher agent densities led to the faster spread of an infection. However, at very high densities, if physical collisions are considered then the movement of each individual becomes sufficiently impaired to reduce the ability for long-range interactions to form and slows transmission. More complex behaviours such as territory formation also modulated transmission rate, with a trade-off observed between maintaining stronger but shorter range interactions for smaller territories, or weaker but longer range interactions when an individual is free to diffuse throughout the entire environment. Optimal transmission was found when individuals maintained territories of intermediate size.",

This idealised \u2018toy\u2019 model is deliberately simple to allow for an easier interpretation of the results and to provide clearer links between the behaviours of individuals and high-level collective transmission properties. Nevertheless, it is important to recognise that these simplifications ignore the fact that individuals in many real-world animal populations do exhibit strong behavioural responses to the presence of disease [35] and that these changes can significantly alter the transmission properties of the group [34]. Indeed, many animal species exhibit strong aversive behaviour to others that appear to be disease-carriers [24], and in highly social species, responses to the presence of disease may also be implemented by coordinated group-level responses. For examples, in human societies quarantines and curfews are used to reduce the potential for interactions between susceptible and infected individuals. Incorporating some form of adaptive behaviour would offer an interesting future direction for this work that the methodology is ideally suited to tackle.",
