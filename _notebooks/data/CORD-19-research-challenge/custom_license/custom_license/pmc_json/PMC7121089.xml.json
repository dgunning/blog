            "text": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), belonging to the Alphavirus genus of the Togaviridae family is an arthropod-borne virus transmitted by female mosquitoes of the Aedes species [1]. CHIKV infections cause Chikungunya fever which is characterized by abrupt fever, rash and bilateral symmetric arthralgia. In most of the CHIKV-infected patients the acute phase is followed by persistent disabling polyarthritis that can severely incapacitate the patient for weeks up to several months [1]. Despite the widespread emergence of CHIKV and the high morbidity rate associated with it, there is no approved vaccine or antiviral treatment available at the moment. The current therapy is therefore purely based on the relief of the patient\u2019s symptoms and consists of the administration of analgesics, antipyretics, anti-inflammatory agents such as paracetamol, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and of bed rest and fluids intake [2]. The use of aspirin during CHIKV infection is to be avoided because of the risk of bleeding and the potential risk of developing Reye\u2019s syndrome [3]. In addition, the use of systemic corticosteroids is not recommended due to the strong rebound effect after cessation of treatment [1]. In severe cases, where patients have limited response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, or sulphasalazine can be administered to relieve the symptoms [3, 4]. The development of novel, potent antiviral drugs against CHIKV is thus urgently needed.",

Chloroquine was reported to inhibit CHIKV entry into cells, possibly by raising the endosomal pH and thus preventing the fusion of the CHIKV E1 protein with the endosomal membrane [7, 8]. The potential effect of chloroquine treatment was assessed in two clinical trials. In a first clinical trial improvement of symptoms in the chronic phase of CHIKV infection were reported following chloroquine treatment [7], whereas another study failed to prove the efficacy of chloroquine as a treatment for the acute phase of CHIKV infection [8]. Therefore, the use of chloroquine as anti-CHIKV antiviral requires further study to prove its effectiveness and to determine the appropriate dosage and length of treatment.",

Arbidol was also reported as an inhibitor of CHIKV infection in MRC-5 cells [10]. The mechanism of its anti-CHIKV activity has not been totally elucidated. An arbidol-resistant CHIKV strain could be selected and was shown to have acquired a mutation at amino acid 407 (G407R) in the CHIKV E2 glycoprotein, which may be involved in binding to host receptors [10]. Recently, a series of arbidol analogues have been synthesized and evaluated for their anti-CHIKV activity [11]. Two analogues in this series (IIIe and IIIf) inhibited the CHIKV-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) with selectivity indices higher than that of the parent compound arbidol [11].",

The antiviral activity of these molecules was confirmed using a recombinant CHIKV strain carrying a luciferase reporter gene (CHIKV-Rluc). When compared to the SFV-based screening results, the molecules showed similar potencies against the CHIKV-Rluc; however, the EC50 values determined using the CHIKV-Rluc were higher.

These siRNAs could thus be used in combination with other antivirals for more effective treatment.

SiRNAs directed against nsP1 and E2 as well as their combinations, reduced in vitro CHIKV replication in Vero cells with more than 90 %.

Ribavirin was shown to inhibit the replication of CHIKV in vitro [20]. In addition, the combination of ribavirin and IFN-\u03b12b was reported to result in asynergistic inhibitory effect against CHIKV replication in Vero cells [20]. The mechanism of the antiviral action of ribavirin is likely different for different viruses. The 5\u2032-monophosphate metabolite of ribavirin acts a competitive inhibitor of inosine monophosphatedehydrogenase (IMPDH) resulting in a depletion of intracellular GTP (and dGTP) pools [21]. The predominant mechanism by which ribavirin inhibits the replication of other RNA viruses such as flaviviruses and paramyxoviruses has been shown to be mediated by depletion of GTP pools [22]. Other suggested mechanisms by which ribavirin inhibits RNA virus replication include the inhibition of viral RNA capping, inhibition of the viral polymerase, and lethal mutagenesis of the RNA genome [23].",

In addition, the oral treatment of CHIKV-infected AG129 mice with T-705 protected these mice from severe neurological disease and reduced the mortality rate by more than 50 %. Low-level T-705-resistant CHIKV variants have been selected. These variants carried a K291R mutation in the F1 motif of the RdRp that was shown to be responsible for the observed resistance to T-705.

In addition, nsP2 plays an important role in shutting down host cell mRNA transcription via degradation of a subunit of the DNA-directed RNA polymerase II. It also inhibits the host antiviral response by suppressing transcription and type I/II interferon-stimulated JAK/STAT signaling [28]. In a high-throughput screening for CHIKV nsP2 inhibitors that target the nsP2-mediated transcriptional shut off, a natural compound derivative (ID1452-2) was shown to partially block the nsP2 activity resulting in inhibition of CHIKV replication in cell culture [29]. In another study, a number of nsP2 inhibitors were identified using a computer-aided screening procedure of which one lead compound (compound 1) showed a significant antiviral activity against CHIKV [30]. This compound was predicted to bind to the central portion of the nsP2 protease active site.",

In general, HSP-90 is involved in maturation, localization, and turnover of its client proteins in a cell. HSP-90 has been reported to play an important role in the replication of many DNA and RNA viruses such as hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, human cytomegalovirus and influenza virus. Consequently, HSP-90 inhibitors may have a role as broad(er)-spectrum antiviral agents. Two HSP-90 inhibitors, HS-10 and SNX-2112, were reported as CHIKV replication inhibitors. The treatment of CHIKV-infected mice (SvA129) with HS-10 and SNX-2112 significantly reduced the serum viral load at 48 h post-infection and protected against the CHIKV-induced inflammation in the limb of infected mice [36]. In co-immunoprecipitation studies CHIKV nsP3 and nsP4 were shown to interact with HSP-90. Interestingly, the knockdown of the HSP-90\u03b1 subunit resulted in a more pronounced inhibition of viral replication than targeting the HSP-90\u03b2 subunit. HSP-90\u03b1 is thought to be involved in the stabilization of CHIKV nsP4 and the formation of the CHIKV replication complex [36].

Interestingly, chemically or enzymatically synthesized dsRNA molecules with an exposed 5\u2032-triphosphate end (5\u2032 ppp) were reported to induce RIG-I [42, 43]. It has been recently shown that pretreatment of MRC-5 cells with an optimized 5\u2032 triphosphorylated RNA molecule triggered RIG-I stimulation resulting in protection against CHIKV infection [44]. Moreover, the protective response against CHIKV induced by this 5\u2032 ppp RNA was largely independent of the type I IFN response. These results suggest the potential efficacy of RIG-I agonists as an antiviral treatment for CHIKV infection.",

So far, a number of classes of compounds that inhibit viral replication by targeting either a viral or a host factor have been reported. Most of the compounds have relatively modest activity and for most of them, activity in infection models (in mice) was not assessed. Some of these classes may serve as a starting point for the design of more specific and selective inhibitors of CHIKV replication. Also, to the best of our knowledge, no information is available yet on the effect of antivirals on the chronic stage of CHIKV infection. Recently, mouse models for CHIKV-induced arthritis and chronic joint disease have been developed which will help the evaluation of CHIKV antiviral agents in different stages of CHIKV infection [47, 48]. Several other viruses belonging to the Alphavirus genus, in particular the equine encephalitis viruses are considered to be a potential bioterroristic threat. When designing/developing antivirals against the Chikungunya virus it may be important to develop classes of compounds that have pan-alphavirus activity and that could thus also be used for the treatment of alphaviruses other than CHIKV.",

This could markedly facilitate their evaluation for clinical use in CHIKV-infected patients. Favipravir, a drug with a broad-spectrum antiviral activity, has been approved in Japan for the treatment of influenza virus infections. It is currently also being evaluated in Western Africa for the treatment of Ebola virus infection. If its activity is demonstrated against this infection, this compound may be considered for treatment of other infections such as those caused by CHIKV. However, given the growing number of patients suffering from CHIKV infections, it may be justified to develop specific CHIKV/alphavirus drugs. Highly potent drugs are today available for the treatment of infections with herpes viruses, HIV, the hepatitis B and C virus. Without a doubt, it should also be possible, when investing sufficient effort, to develop highly effective and safe drugs for the treatment (and perhaps even prophylaxis) of infections with alphaviruses.",
