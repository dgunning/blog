Possible explanations include cross-protective antibodies from previous exposure to influenza A (H1N1) strains circulating before the antigenic shift of influenza A to subtype H2N2 in 1957 or minimal contact with those most likely to have imported the pandemic strain into Canada (young travelers) (12). In addition, older persons may have less contact with the age group (children 10\u201319 years of age), with most cases being in Ontario. Our findings support Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for vaccination with monovalent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus vaccine. These guidelines have not placed older persons in a high priority group for vaccination because increased rates of hospitalization and severe disease caused by pandemic (H1N1) 2009 have not been observed (13,14). Investment in multiplex technologies to investigate respiratory outbreaks in LTCFs shortens time for pathogen detection, helps guide infection control and vaccination policies, and can potentially save resources spent on other investigations.",
