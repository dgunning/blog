But the new report casts some doubt on the link between civets and transmission to humans. The province's SARS research team found that market workers who handled civets were less likely to show clinical signs of being exposed to the SARS virus than other workers.",

To detect the gravitational disturbances, the probe contains gyroscopes made with immense precision, which can measure movements of as a little as one hundred-thousandth of a degree. At the heart of each is a chunk of quartz the size of a ping-pong ball, milled to within 40 atomic layers of a perfect sphere. Each sphere is contained in a near-perfect vacuum with a pressure ten times less than the void of empty space. And the whole thing is cooled to \u2212271 \u00b0C to prevent the equipment being affected by heat. Initial results are expected in 2006.",
