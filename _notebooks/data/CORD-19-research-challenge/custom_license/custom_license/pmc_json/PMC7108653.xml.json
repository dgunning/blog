All animals were housed in outdoor enclosures with natural lighting. Adult (\u22652 years of age) coyotes were randomly assigned an unrelated mate before winter, and whenever possible, an established pair remained together for several years. Mated pairs resided in individual 0.1-ha pens with access to sheltered den boxes. Three pens formed a clover-shaped cluster separated by double fencing and concrete barriers. Although physically separated, all pairs were within visual and audible range of other coyotes. As required, females were sequestered from their mates during the breeding season and served as nonpregnant controls. In these cases, the coyotes were housed individually in sheltered outdoor kennels with attached den boxes for privacy, and pair-mates were kept near each other in adjacent kennels during their separation.",

Routine parasite control was administered as indicated.

For coyotes in this study, estrus was the phase during which the female was receptive and cooperative with her mate's attempts to copulate, and the beginning of estrus was demarcated by the 1st observed copulatory tie (or sperm in the vaginal smear). Proestrus precedes estrus and is characterized by the presence of red blood cells in vaginal exudate. Diestrus immediately follows estrus and includes pregnancy and the protracted luteal phase of nonpregnant females. Luteal activity is typically prolonged in nonpregnant canids; and because the expression of progesterone is indistinguishable between pregnant and nonpregnant females, the latter are commonly described as pseudopregnant (Concannon et al. 1989; Feldman and Nelson 2004). Accordingly, a coyote was described as pseudopregnant if there was a marked and sustained elevation of serum progesterone after ovulation. Pseudopregnancy was assumed to be covert and subclinical (i.e., no mammary development, lactation, or denning behavior) unless otherwise noted. After parturition, or regression of the corpora lutea, hormone synthesis diminishes and anestrus follows diestrus.",

The value of seeing a pair in a copulatory tie, viewing spermatozoa on a vaginal smear, or detecting pups in a den are obvious. However, in the absence of such indicators, investigators might depend instead upon the observation of affinitive and appetitive behaviors in coyotes. When blood samples can be obtained, measurement of blood hormone levels can provide evidence of ovulation, and distinguish pregnancy from pseudopregnancy. Also, the relative prevalence of exfoliated epithelial cells, red cells, leukocytes, and other inclusions on a vaginal smear can help predict the breeding status or reproductive potential of an animal. However, the use of several of these elements together will increase the overall confidence in determining the reproductive status of an individual, or population of coyotes.",
