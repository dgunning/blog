World over, a total of 965 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection, including at least 357 related deaths have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) as of 3 February 2015.2 In addition to outbreaks in the Arabian Peninsula, sporadic cases have been imported to Europe, Africa, Asia, and North America in returning travellers. No sustained transmission has been reported outside the Arabian Peninsula. Evidence point to a reservoir for the virus among both bats3 and camels,4 but the issue is not yet settled.5",
