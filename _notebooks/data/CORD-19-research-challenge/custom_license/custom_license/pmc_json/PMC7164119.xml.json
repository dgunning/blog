            "text": "All members of family M1 of Zn\u2010dependent aminopeptidases share two well\u2010conserved peptide motifs of six to seven residues. To characterize additional members (e.g. aminopeptidase W) that might belong to this family, completely degenerated oligonucleotides were deduced and used to amplify the respective cDNA fragments from rat pituitary. Among the products obtained was one fragment that was highly homologous but did not match perfectly to any of the known aminopeptidases. Using this PCR product as a probe, we isolated three independent clones from a rat pineal\u2010gland cDNA library. The largest (no. 20) contained a cDNA insert of 5 kb; the others (nos 6 and 11) had inserts of 2.9 and 2.7 kb, respectively (Fig. 1A). Despite the differences in total size, clones 11 and 20 had the same 5\u2032\u2010terminal sequences (except for three more nucleotides in clone 20) and identical 3\u2032 ends [except for a longer poly(A) tail in clone 11]. Clone 6 was identical with clone 11 except for the first 257 nucleotides, which were missing. Clones 20 and 11 were sequenced completely. The sequences were identical except for an inserted fragment of 2.1 kb in clone 20 starting at nucleotide 2697. Alignment with the other members of family M1 revealed that this position maps to an exon/intron boundary in human aminopeptidase N [19], mouse aminopeptidase A [20], and human TRH\u2010DE [21]. The putative retained intron in clone 20 displays the invariant splice site consensus residues (AGgt\u2013agGT), and the splice acceptor site is preceded by a pyrimidine\u2010rich sequence (75% pyrimidines within the 20 nucleotides in front of the GT\u2010acceptor site). Interestingly, the sequences of both the 5\u2032 end of this intron and the 5\u2032 end of the following exon are very similar, and the first 10 nucleotides display 80% identity (consensus: GTAAARGGRT). This may explain a high rate of alternative usage as the acceptor site (see Fig. 2B for details).",

It is preceded by a short 5\u2032 UTR that contains three in\u2010frame stop codons (at nucleotides 10, 16 and 46). Alternative ATG initiation codons further downstream (nucleotides 152, 178, 212) do not match the consensus sequence to a higher degree. The longest ORF starts at the aforementioned ATG (nucleotide 61) and encodes a protein of 930 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 106 kDa (Fig. 1B). Hydropathy analysis using the Kyte and Doolittle algorithm [23] predicts a single hydrophobic region at the N\u2010terminus (Fig. 1C). A network\u2010based analysis employing the signal prediction server SignalP V1.1 (http://genome.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/index.html) predicts this stretch to represent an N\u2010terminal signal sequence (Fig. 2A). The size of the predicted signal peptide agrees well with the average length of 22.6 residues, as determined from over 1000 individual eukaryotic signal sequences [24]. The consensus sequence for Zn\u2010dependent metallopetidases His\u2010Glu\u2010Xaa\u2010Xaa\u2010His is found at residues 342\u2013346 and followed by a second Glu separated by 18 residues, which has been shown to participate in Zn binding [25]. A third Glu (residue 309) is found at a conserved position in the context of the invariant triad Met\u2010Glu\u2010Asn shared by all M1 members. Site\u2010directed mutagenesis studies with aminopeptidase N characterized this residue to be involved in the binding of the free N\u2010terminus of the substrate [26]. Another residue (Tyr427) is found at a conserved distance from the Zn\u2010binding motif in a homologous environment and has been shown to participate in stabilizing the transition\u2010state complex in aminopeptidase A [27]. The sequence predicts six potential N\u2010glycosylation sites and four O\u2010glycosylations sites. The 3\u2032 UTR extends for only 60 nucleotides and contains a polyadenylation signal like sequence AGTAAA (nucleotides 2890\u20132896) at a distance of 15 nucleotides from the poly(A) tail. The finding that all three independent clones share the same site of polyadenylation indicates that it should represent the authentic 3\u2032 end of the transcript. The same applies for the 5\u2032 end, as it is shared by two of the isolated clones and the 3\u2010nucleotide longer version of clone 20 aligns perfectly with a recently released mouse expressed sequence tag (accession no. AT119040, GI:3519364), which shows 92% identity over its total length of 605 nucleotides, indicating that it partially represents the mouse ortholog of PILS\u2010AP.",

Of the 20 aminoacyl\u2010\u03b2\u2010naphthylamide derivatives tested, only Leu\u2010\u03b2\u2010naphthylamide and Met\u2010\u03b2\u2010naphthylamide were effectively cleaved (Fig. 5). Comparing the relative activities under the conditions described, Leu\u2010\u03b2\u2010naphthylamide turned out to be a four times better substrate than Met\u2010\u03b2\u2010naphthylamide. Hydrolysis of the remaining aminoacyl\u2010\u03b2\u2010naphthylamide derivatives was minimal (< 2% of Leu\u2010\u03b2\u2010naphthylamide hydrolysis). Aminopeptidase activity obeyed Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics. Analysis by a Lineweaver\u2013Burk plot yielded a graph of first order leading to a K\nm value of 65.4 \u00b5m for Leu\u2010\u03b2\u2010naphthylamide hydrolysis (Fig. 6A) and 77.4 \u00b5m for Met\u2010\u03b2\u2010naphthylamide hydrolysis. Analysis of the temperature\u2010dependence and pH\u2010dependence for Leu\u2010\u03b2\u2010naphthylamide hydrolysis showed optimal enzymatic activities at 40 \u00b0C and at pH 8.0 (Fig. 6B,C).",

While working on the highly specific metallopeptidase TRH\u2010DE, we realized that there were similarities to the published data on the X\u2010Trp\u2010specific hydrolase (aminopeptidase W, EC 3.4.11.16) with respect to size, Zn\u2010dependence, topology and neuronal localization [30, 31]. Thus we rationalized that it should belong to the same family of metallopeptidases, and therefore started a PCR\u2010based screening approach. The cDNA clones isolated seem to represent the major and a minor incompletely/alternatively spliced transcript of a new member of family M1 of Zn\u2010dependent metallopeptidases (PILS\u2010AP). Its mRNA is easily detected in all rat tissues and cell lines analyzed so far, indicating ubiquitous expression. Moreover, expressed sequence tags from mouse and man can be assigned to represent PILS\u2010AP orthologs by displaying a high degree of sequence conservation. In man, these sequences have been derived from various cDNA sources (heart, pancreas, fat, ovary, testis, etc.), thus corroborating its widespread distribution.",

            "text": "The primary sequence of PILS\u2010AP, as predicted from the major transcript, contains all of the known functionally important residues shared by the members of family M1 of Zn\u2010dependent aminopeptidases. Besides these homologies, important differences in substrate specificity, the subcellular localization and enzyme chemical characteristics are evident, indicating that PILS\u2010AP is not aminopeptidase W, but an as yet uncharacterized enzyme. PILS\u2010AP does not accept basic or acidic substrates like aminopeptidase A, aminopeptidase B or leukotriene\u2010A4 hydrolase. The other M1 members, i.e. insulin\u2010regulated aminopeptidase (placental leucine aminopeptidase/oxytocinase), aminopeptidase N and PSA, prefer neutral and/or hydrophobic residues. This preference partially overlaps with the spectrum of PILS\u2010AP, but its limited substrate range, i.e. Leu\u2010\u03b2\u2010naphthylamide and Met\u2010\u03b2\u2010naphthylamide as the sole aminoacyl\u2010\u03b2\u2010naphthylamide derivatives accepted, clearly distinguishes it from these aminopeptidases, which also hydrolyze chemically similar residues such as Val\u2010\u03b2\u2010naphthylamide or Ile\u2010\u03b2\u2010naphthylamide to a comparable degree. Another striking difference from PSA is the insensitivity of PILS\u2010AP to puromycin, a substance that in our expression system, i.e. Sf 9 cells, was able to inhibit the endogenous insect Leu\u2010cleaving activities almost completely. Recently the purification of a neuron\u2010specific Leu\u2010cleaving aminopeptidase from rat brain has been described [32]. Although the substrate specificity is very similar (Leu and Met derivatives as the preferred substrates), the clear difference in sensitivity towards puromycin again allows unequivocal discrimination. Another well\u2010characterized Leu\u2010preferring aminopeptidase is the ubiquitously expressed cytosolic leucine aminopeptidase, which has been best characterized from bovine lens [33]. It is a soluble hexameric Zn\u2010dependent enzyme composed of identical subunits of 54 kDa each in its native form. Several leucine aminopeptidases from various organisms have been characterized and collectively constitute clan MF, family M17 of cocatalytic leucyl\u2010metallopeptidases [34]. Again, these enzymes differ from PILS\u2010AP by sequence and by the relaxed substrate specificity hydrolyzing Leu\u2010\u03b2\u2010naphthylamide and most N\u2010terminal amino acids with comparable rates [35]. Moreover, the identity of mammalian leucine aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.1) with proline aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.5) has been demonstrated [36]. In addition, the K\nm for Leu\u2010\u03b2\u2010naphthylamide hydrolysis by leucine aminopeptidase is substantially higher (250 \u00b5m vs. 65 \u00b5m for PILS\u2010AP) and leucine aminopeptidase is clearly more sensitive to l\u2010leucinethiol and to the naturally occurring inhibitors bestatin and amastatin. With respect to the metal\u2010chelating inhibitors, PILS\u2010AP could be effectively inhibited by 1,10 phenanthroline and EDTA. This was expected in analogy with the other M1 members, but interestingly the effect of EDTA became maximal only after prolonged preincubation periods, which is generally not the case for the other metallopeptidases. The observed kinetics of inhibition of PILS\u2010AP with EDTA is very reminiscent of the EDTA effects on TRH\u2010DE, the only M1 family member with high substrate specificity that is known to have a highly conserved structure [21] and to bind Zn2+ very tightly [37]. An even more pronounced time\u2010dependence was observed for astacin, a small metallopeptidase from crayfish, for which a 200\u2010h preincubation period was necessary to obtain 50% inhibition [38]. Taken together, the substrate spectrum of PILS\u2010AP is strikingly limited, and the sensitivity towards various inhibitors is consistent with a Zn\u2010dependent enzyme which binds the metal ion tightly. The deduced primary structure predicts a cleavable signal peptide for the N\u2010terminus. This feature is unique among the currently known mammalian M1 family members. Aminopeptidase A, aminopeptidase N, insulin\u2010regulated aminopeptidase and TRH\u2010DE contain N\u2010terminal domains of 23\u201325 consecutive hydrophobic residues which anchor these peptidases as type\u2010II ectoenzymes. In contrast, PSA is a cytosolic enzyme which may functionally interact with proteasomes [11]. Although it has been found partially associated with membrane, this interaction is clearly different from integral membrane proteins, and the active site was localized within the cytosol [39]. Aminopeptidase B and the closely related leukotriene\u2010A4 hydrolase are soluble enzymes which can be found as secreted aminopeptidases, although no classical signal peptide can be predicted in the primary sequences. With respect to PILS\u2010AP, our analysis of the subcellular localization of the EGFP\u2010fusion proteins in mammalian cells argues in favor of the functionality of its signal peptide. The nature of the vesicles to which the enzyme was targeted and the possibility of regulated secretion remain crucial questions to be addressed in the future. Given the high homology to the other M1 members and the widespread expression of PILS\u2010AP, the narrow substrate specificity is a rather atypical feature among the known peptidases [40], and it is increasingly puzzling that nature developed such a multitude of peptidases which are all capable of cleaving N\u2010terminal Leu residues.",
