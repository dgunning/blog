However, due to their short half-life and low transfection efficiency, clinical application is limited. In this regard, non-replicating recombinant viral vectors with high delivery efficiency may provide a novel antiviral option [18\u201320].",

            "text": "HIV-1-derived LVs, intensively optimized during the last decade, are one of the most promising systems. They not only provide a non-pathogenic and latent infection by integrating into the host genome, but also demonstrate high transduction efficiency in both dividing and non-dividing cells with persistent transgene expression [21\u201323]. Currently LV-based vaccines have already been tested in preclinical trials for protection against or treatment of HIV-1 [9]. Moreover, several routes of LVs administration invoking sustained anti-HIV immune responses have been explored in mice [24, 25]. These findings suggest that the LVs may also be suitable delivery vectors for gene therapy in antiviral treatment. In addition, a novel tetracycline, or doxycycline (DOX), respectively, regulated RNAi system based on LVs has been developed to avoid the undesirable toxicity that may be induced by long-term shRNA expression [26, 27]. In this system, a fusion protein (tTR-KRAB) of the DNA binding domain of the Escherichia coli tetracycline repressor (tTR) and the approximately 75 amino acid KRAB repressor is likewise delivered by an LV, LV-tTR-KRAB. KRAB suppresses transcription from both RNA polymerase II and RNA polymerase III promoters within a distance of up to 3 kb from its binding site [28, 29]. The mechanism is not entirely known but seems to involve local heterochromatin formation and histone deacetylation, and/or an indirect influence of the arrangement of the basal transcription machinery [30\u201332]. When a promoter is juxtaposed with tet operator (tetO) sequences, as in the LV-HBV-shRNA vectors used in this study, the tTR-KRAB protein is specifically targeted to this promoter by the tTR domain and represses shRNA transcription in the absence of DOX. Conversely, addition of DOX releases tTR-KRAB from tetO, thus permitting shRNA expression [26] (Fig. 1b).\n",

DR1 is an essential cis-element for replication; the 3\u2032 DR1 copy on the pregenomic (pg) RNA contains the acceptor site for the DNA primer generated during initiation of reverse transcription at 5\u2032 \u03b5 [33\u201335]. CP controls transcription [36, 37] of the pgRNA which serves as template for HBV DNA synthesis and also as mRNA for polymerase and core protein [35, 38], and of the precore RNA from which the precore protein precursor of secreted HBeAg [39] is translated. Moreover, the CP region overlaps with the \u03d5 cis-element which facilitates first-strand template switch and initiation of minus-strand DNA synthesis [40, 41]. The RT region of the HBV polymerase is essential for reverse transcriptase activity [42]; on top, the same nucleotide sequence overlappingly encodes part of the S gene. Not the least, the suitability as RNAi targets of DR1 and the specific RT region chosen was already demonstrated using simple shRNA expression plasmids [43].",

            "text": "Numerous studies exploring RNAi as a potential therapeutic option to inhibit viral replication have been reported, e.g., for HIV-1, HAV, HCV, HSV and others [12, 51, 52]. Although HBV is a DNA virus, RNA plays a key role in its replication as template for generation of new DNA genomes by reverse transcription. Therefore, RNAi can not only act on the viral mRNAs and prevent generation of viral proteins but directly interfere with HBV replication. This has been confirmed by several studies employing synthetic siRNAs and plasmid-based shRNAs targeting different regions of the HBV genome, both in vitro and in hydrodynamically transfected mice in vivo [53\u201355]. However, due to the short half-life of siRNAs and limited and variable transfection efficiency of shRNA plasmids, the inhibitory effects are transient, lasting only a few days, limiting their application for long-term gene silencing in mammalian systems [56]. This issue is partially overcome using adenovirus- or retrovirus-based vectors for shRNA expression which have successfully been applied to suppress HBV replication [49, 57]. However, adenoviral vectors do not integrate, are likely to be lost during cell division, and thus can achieve only transient shRNA expression. Furthermore, adenovirus is a very common human pathogen and in vivo delivery may be hampered by pre-existing host immune responses. Retroviruses, on the other hand, require cell division for integration, and hence are inefficient in transducing genes into non-dividing cells such as quiescent hepatocytes.",

Third, gene silencing can be regulated by addition of DOX, minimizing potential toxicity induced by long-term shRNA expression, such as induction of interferon responses [58] of \u201coff-target\u201d activities by or complementarity to non-target genes in only six or seven nucleotides of the guide strand [59].

Consistent with the data from cells transfected with the parental pSuper-HBV-shRNA plasmids (Supplementary Fig. 1), LV-delivered shRNA2 targeting the CP region and especially shRNA3 targeting the DR1 region were more efficient than shRNA1 directed against the RT region in suppressing HBsAg and HBeAg (Fig. 2). However, both the level of inhibition and the duration of the silencing effect were much more pronounced for LV-delivered shRNA; for instance, LV-HBV-shRNA3 suppressed HBsAg production of HBsAg up to 98.5 % at 72 h post-transduction (Fig. 2), and highly efficient suppression was maintained for 2 weeks (Fig. 7). The most likely explanation is that transfection reaches only a fraction of the virus producing cells and the non-replicating plasmid is diluted out by cell division. In contrast, transduction by the LVs is highly efficient (around 95 % in our experiments) and the shRNA expression cassettes become stably integrated. The trend toward slightly lower suppression after 1 week may reflect a slow selection of cells with reduced shRNA expression. Overall similar results were observed for secreted HBeAg although suppression was less pronounced than for HBsAg, both in plasmid-transfected and in LV-transduced cell (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1). There is no obvious explanation but similar results were reported by Uprichard et al. [49] and Deng et al. [50]. It was suggested that the relative RNAi resistance of the precore mRNA compared to the 2.4 and 2.1 kb mRNAs may be due to a more global protection within RNA-protein complexes on the rough endoplasmic reticulum [49]. An alternative explanation could be that expression of HBeAg in the cell system used is not limited by mRNA levels but by the efficacy of posttranslational steps of protein production.",

LV-HBV-shRNA1 caused only limited suppression of HBV RNA (30 %). This is probably due to poor target accessibility [62], which is affected by RNA structure and protein binding [63]. While these parameters are difficult to assess, the high activity of shRNA3 may relate to the fact that its DR1 target region is present in two copies on the pgRNA (see Fig. 1); RNAi targeting either the 5\u2032 or the 3\u2032 site would induce their degradation and, for the pgRNA, prevent it from acting as template for reverse transcription.",

Somewhat surprising was the still strong suppression of extracellular HBV DNA by shRNA1; however, that overall replication is more vulnerable to RNAi than expression of individual gene products has previously been observed for some anti-HBV shRNAs [43]. This suggests that interference with replication may not exclusively occur by target RNA degradation but involve other mechanisms; for instance, sequence-specific binding of the guide RNA could block interaction sites on the pgRNA that are important for packaging or reverse transcription.",

Moreover, they demonstrate that the DOX-controlled system allows for fully reversible regulation of the antiviral shRNA effects and thus also of HBV replication in a stably HBV expressing human hepatoma cell line. Hence, this new system should provide a valuable platform to study the pharmacokinetics of RNA drugs in general, and against HBV in particular. The data also suggest the potential of this system for therapeutic purposes, possibly in combination with conventional anti-HBV drugs such as nucleos(t)ide analogs to a priori reduce viral loads. However, prior to any practical application for treatment of chronic HBV infection, further studies in animal models will be required to evaluate its efficiency and safety in vivo, including potential toxicity of the tTR-KRAB fusion protein.",

A linearized version of the 3,182 bp HBV genome (Genbank accession no.: J02203) is shown; one unit-length genome comprises the sequence from position 1,901 to 1,900; in HepG2.2.15 cells the genome is integrated as head-to-tail dimer, symbolized by the dashed extensions. The first nt of the siRNA target sites is indicated by a number followed by \u201ci\u201d. All target sites have a \u226595 % conservation rate in HBV genotypes A-H [43]. Individual genes are depicted as bars; pC, precore; pS1, preS1; pS2, preS2. Viral transcripts comprise the 3.5 kb precore RNA which includes the precore start codon for HBeAg production, and the slightly shorter pgRNA which serves as mRNA for core protein and polymerase, and as template for new DNA genomes. Note that the DR1 region is present twice on these terminally redundant RNAs. The 2.4 kb RNA encodes the large envelope protein L (PreS1/PreS2/S), the 2.1 kb RNA encode the M (PreS2/S) and the S protein. The 0.8 kb RNA is the mRNA for HBx. b Principle of DOX-controlled shRNA expression.  On the LV-HBV-shRNA expression vectors, the H1 promoter driving shRNA transcription is juxtaposed with tetO sequences. In the absence of DOX, the tTR-KRAB fusion protein, co-transduced into the same cell by the LV-tTR-KRAB vector, binds to tetO and suppresses shRNA transcription (\u201cOFF\u201d). Addition of DOX (small blue spheres) causes release of tTR-KRAB and shRNA is transcribed (\u201cON\u201d)",
