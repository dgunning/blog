Ad5 vectors have been tested for use in intramuscular (i.m.) immunizations and in DNA-rAd vaccine regimens in human clinical trials, providing an important proof of concept for adenovirus-based vaccine vectors.9,16 Ad41-based vaccines have yet to be tested clinically; however, the natural tropism of this virus for the gastrointestinal tract may prove beneficial in terms of delivering antigen to an otherwise hostile gut environment.14,15 This tropism may allow for the oral administration of vaccine vectors, as well as the enhanced induction of mucosal immunity,17 thereby decreasing the likelihood of pathogen transmission via the mucosa. The recent development of a replication-deficient recombinant Ad41 (rAd41) vector expressing the HIV envelope protein (Env) strongly supports this hypothesis, as this construct has been shown to induce HIV Env-specific systemic and mucosal immune responses after prime-boost immunization.18,19",

Although recent progress has been made, robust stimulation of mucosal immunity remains difficult. Several approaches have been used to elicit mucosal immune responses using rAd5-based vaccines.18,19,31 Intranasal immunization with a rAd5 vaccine generated stronger IgA responses in systemic and mucosal compartments than i.m. immunization in mice; however, safety concerns may limit the use of the approach in humans.28 In addition, oral immunization is the most convenient way to deliver mucosal vaccines. Heterologous rAd41 oral or ileal priming followed by an i.m. rAd5 boost elicits enhanced intestinal mucosal cellular immunity.18 In this study, we found that antigen-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies were induced by the i.g. administration of rAd5-based or rAd41-based vaccines expressing the S protein of MERS-CoV. This immunization strategy is associated with increased safety and applicability relative to an oral challenge, making it an excellent choice for future vaccine development efforts. Furthermore, as increasing evidence supports a role for dromedary camels as a reservoir of MERS-CoV,32 our vaccination strategy may hold promise for the development of a preventive vaccine that targets the animal reservoir; and this may be an effective approach to eliminate the transmission of MERS-CoV to humans.",

Oral or i.g. immunization with rAd5 or rAd41 vectors targeted the digestive epithelium, where the induction of mucosal and systemic immunity is well documented.14,18,19,30 Other studies have suggested that mucosal routing of vaccine vectors may be used to optimize mucosal and cellular immunity.33\u201336 In this study, we found that the route of rAd vector delivery critically impacted both systemic and mucosal immunity. In particular, i.m. rAd immunization consistently generated high-level T-lymphocyte responses among the systemic and mucosal compartments. In contrast, i.g. immunization generated no detectable T lymphocytes in both serum and mucosal sites. Our finding suggests that a single i.m. dose of Ad5-S or Ad41-S induced strong, persistent and complementary systemic and mucosal immunity, and represents an appealing strategy for the control of MERS-CoV transmission. Continued development of appropriate formulations such as enteric coatings or nanoparticles might allow these vectors to be more amenable to clinical applications.37,38",

During the preparation of this manuscript, a different group reported that antibody responses against the S protein were sufficient for neutralizing MERS-CoV in vitro.39 These responses could be induced using an i.m. vaccination with rAd5-based MERS-CoV candidate vaccines followed by a secondary intranasal boost 3 weeks later. Our results indicated that a single i.m. or i.g. administration of Ad5-S or Ad41-S induced S-antigen-specific systemic and mucosal immunity. Furthermore, the most significant and sustained neutralizing antibody production as well as cell-mediated immunity could be elicited by rAd5-based vaccine via the intramuscular route. Because no full-length S protein was available on hand, all evolution of the antibody response (IgG and IgA) against S was limited to RBD-specific antibodies. We understand that other S-protein-specific antibodies may play a role in the neutralization and protection of the infection, although the majority of RBD-specific antibodies are neutralizing. In addition, the protocol of IgA assay for evaluation of mucosal immunity in this study needs to be further optimized. Although further study will be necessary to evaluate the protective efficacy of rAd5-MERS-S or rAd41-MERS-S vectors in humans and dromedary camels, our results strongly support a role for rAd5- or rAd41-encoding MERS-S antigens as a safe and effective strategy for MERS-CoV prevention.",

A cytomegalovirus promoter and simian virus 40 polyA tail were used to control target gene expression. (b) Detection of MERS-S by Western blotting. Exponentially growing HEK293 cells were infected by Ad41-MERS-S or Ad5-MERS-S for 48 hr. Total proteins were then extracted and resolved by SDS\u2013PAGE. MERS-S expression was confirmed by Western blotting using polyclonal rabbit anti-emc antibodies; proteins from GFP-containing viruses were used as a negative control. (c) Detection of MERS-S by immunofluorescence. HEK293 cells were infected as described in (b). The cells were then fixed with cold methanol in situ and probed with polyclonal rabbit anti-emc antibodies and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies.
