Its rapid spread in human population suggested the appearance of a novel infectious agent which has been identified as a retrovirus a few years later [2]. The Lyme disease described in 1975, due to Borrelia burgdoferi transmitted by ticks [3] or the Creutzfeldt\u2010Jakob disease occurring in young adults and associated with the mad\u2010cow in UK are other examples [4]. The severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by the SARS\u2010CoV coronavirus is one of the most recent such an event, becoming pandemic within a matter of weeks in early 2003 [5]. SARS spread from the Guangdong province of China to rapidly infect individuals in some 37 countries around the world. The spread of SARS has been fully contained but not eradicated and may potentially return into the human population in the future.",

            "text": "This is the case of the re\u2010emergence of a known disease, which usually has a rare or endemic expression, but suddenly exhibits an increased incidence in a geographical area. The majority of EIDs observed in the past decades enters in this category of events. We can mention the reemergence of Cholera in South America in 1991 after almost one century of absence [6], the dramatic epidemic caused by Dengue virus due to the global expansion of Aedes albopictus [7], or those due to Chikungunya virus, another mosquito\u2010borne transmitted firstly identified in 1952 during an outbreak in Tanzania, then responsible for many outbreaks in Africa and in Asia between 2005 and 2007. Chikungunya virus that has a major health impact in humans, caused a massive epidemic on Reunion Island with a major peak in the number of cases in February 2006 [8]. Another example is those of West Nile disease epidemic, which has affected the United States at the beginning of 2000. Since its introduction to the Western Hemisphere in 1999, WNV had spread across North America, Central and South America and the Caribbean, although the vast majority of severe human cases have occurred in the US and Canada. By 2002\u20132003, the WNV outbreaks have involved thousands of patients causing severe neurologic disease and hundreds of associated fatalities in USA [9]. This was also the case in Europe [10], especially in 2008 in Italy with a re\u2010occurrence of the infection in 2009. The high identity between 2008 and 2009 WNV strains [11], the earlier virus circulation in 2009 and the re\u2010occurrence of the disease starting from the bordering infected areas reached by the infection in the previous year, strongly support the hypothesis of the overwintering of the virus and the endemisation to local host populations and show the failure in the eradication of the virus.",

Influenza viruses constitute the classical model of emerging pathogens due to the high level viral variability caused by their segment RNA genome favourable to point mutations and reassortments. The avian flu due to A/H5N1 and the recent pandemic flu caused by A/H1N1 2009 [14] are two examples of unexpected flu outbreaks. In addition, new or pre\u2010existing and recognized infections can emerge (vaccination escape G145A HBV mutants) [15]or re\u2010emerge (HIV drug resistant strains) due to drug resistance of their agent or to a breakdown in public health (e.g. tuberculosis).",

            "text": "Infectious diseases in humans, generally result from two combined factors. Firstly, a fortuitous contact with the environment (gangrene due to Clostridium, tetanus on injury occasions), arthropod bites (Lyme disease, malaria, WNV\u2026), ingestion of contaminated food (Hepatitis E virus, Listeria,\u2026), accidental inhalation (Legionella..), or an unknown mechanism (Ebola), and secondly a long adaptation of micro organisms to human or animals (for example retroviruses coming from primates before being adapted to humans). The main mechanism leading to the emergence remains the cross\u2010species transmission. Three schematic outcomes of such an event can be described: the human infection is abortive without propagation and animals remain the exclusive hosts, the human infection is severe and inter\u2010human transmission is possible but animals remain the principal reservoir (SARS\u2010CoV), the human infection is completely successful and humans become a reservoir through inter\u2010human transmissions (HIV). Nevertheless, an agent, once classified into one these groups, may move into another category due to viral, host, environmental, or social changes. The first gammaretrovirus recently reported in humans (the Xenotropic Murine Leukaemia Virus\u2010related virus or XMRV), is suspected to be derived from a non\u2010human gammaretrovirus as it shares more than 90% nucleotide identity with the murine virus, MuLVs. It is currently one of the most surveyed emerging agent since its raises many questions with regard to its role in prostate cancer [16]and in patients suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome [17], its mode of transmission [18] and its geographical distribution.",

Urbanization, particularly in the developing world, can lead to very crowded conditions with limited hygiene. Social disruption and wars have also been associated with numerous outbreaks. The spread of an emerging agent may also result from the importation of an animal host (for example, the introduction of monkeypox into the US), a vector such as a mosquito, or even a food. Mobile reservoirs (e.g. birds) can transport pathogens from one region to another over long distances (WNV in 1999 in the US or H5N1 influenza A virus). The climate and weather can also be mentioned (e.g. diseases caused by zoonotic vectors such as West Nile Disease which are moving further from the tropics as the climate warms); changes in human susceptibility (e.g. immunocompromisation with AIDS), economic development (e.g. use of antibiotics to increase meat yield of farmed cows leads to antibiotic resistance, the nCJD caused by the transmission to human of meat coming from cattle, who are normally herbivores, being fed the remains of other cattle in the form of meat and bone meal); breakdown of public health; poverty and social inequality (e.g. tuberculosis in low\u2010income areas); bioterrorism (Anthrax attacks).",

Nevertheless, some unspecific measures, as the conservation of an intact ecosystems and their endemic biodiversity contribute generally reduce the prevalence of infectious diseases. Other relevant tools to prevent and control infections in humans can be mentioned as the control of the burden of mosquitoes during epizootic outbreaks, or as the survey of animals used as sentinels when involved in an EID. Furthermore, unexplained disease symptoms or clinical situations that may suggest the emergence of an infectious disease must be investigated. The next challenge is to detect, investigate and monitor emerging pathogens and the factors influencing their emergence. In this matter, the objective is to implement a continuum of complementary measures from the discovery to the control of the EID, including several stages: the recognition of the EID, adapted epidemiological investigations, etiologic investigations, diagnostic developments, focused research, technology transfer, training, control, and finally eradication of the pathogen. An applied research programme integrating laboratory technologies and optimized surveillance epidemiological tools must be developed to efficiently respond to the potential threat.",

Any infection with an asymptomatic blood\u2010borne phase has the potential for transmission by transfusion, when the infectious phase is prolonged (hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus or HIV infections), or short, (West Nile virus, hepatitis A virus Parvovirus B19 infections). The persistence of the infectious agent in collected blood or components, and its ability to cause infection by the intravenous route are also necessary characteristics for transmission by transfusion. Moreover, the transfusion transmission is of major concern when the agent causes identifiable and/or severe disease in the recipient. The characteristics of the agent and the genetic and immunologic status of the recipient also determine the frequency and severity of the disease resulting from the infection.",

            "text": "The history of HIV infection, which was the first emerging infection with a major effect on blood safety, prompts us to be vigilant facing new emerging threats. However, the decisions taken to reduce the potential transfusion risk of EID are not always based on documented scientific and epidemiologic criteria because most often these data are lacking when the infection appears. Thus, the precautionary principle is often invoked to justify proactive measures. To contribute to appropriate decision making, several surveillance systems have been implemented in some countries to detect \u2018signals\u2019 that may predict whether and how an emerging agent is able to spread and to assess the potential public health threat. More specifically, in transfusion medicine, efforts have been made to classify EIDs into a priority list (AABB\u2019s TTD committee [19]) to help clinicians and transfusion experts in the management of such infections. Different factors are analyzed to classify EIDs including the potential risk to humans, the plausible transmission by transfusion (presence in blood during an asymptomatic phase), the possibility for the agent to be present in the blood supply during an epidemic etc.\u2026 All these initiatives which provide a set of reliable tools to assess the risk should be implemented and adapted to the local emerging situation. However, a possible transmission by blood has to put in balance with another potential risk of transmission. Over the course of the outbreak of Chikungunya in R\u00e9union Island in 2005\u20132007, the mean transfusion risk was estimated at 132 per 100 000 donations with a peak at 1500 per 100 000 donations at the height of the outbreak in February 2006 (accounting for a total of 47 blood donations) whereas, in the same period of time, the risk to be infected by mosquito\u2010borne transmission was estimated at 312 500 of 757 000 inhabitants [8].",
