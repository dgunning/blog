However, tumor regression has not so far been observed as expected.43 The possible reasons for the lack of clinical efficacy could be an entry of advanced cancer patients in immunotherapy trials, and loss or down\u2010regulation of HLA class I molecules, co\u2010stimulatory molecules, and proteins associated with antigen presentation (such as TAP, low\u2010molecular\u2010weight protein (LMP) and \u03b22\u2010microglobulin) in the tumor cells.44 Consequently, a significant portion of tumor cells could escape from CTLs specific to the TAA\u2010derived peptides presented by HLA class I molecules, even if CTLs could be successfully induced by TAA peptide vaccines capable of targeting the tumor cells themselves. The present study investigated the expression of tumor escape\u2010associated genes in 25 specimens of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma tissues using cDNA microarray. In this analysis, no down\u2010regulation of these genes associated with immune escape was observed (data not shown). These results suggested that the CTL\u2010mediated immunotherapy against the cholangiocarcinoma could be effective.",

One is a peptide containing an amino acid sequence of p19ARF24\u201049, which interacts with the FOXM1 C\u2010terminal transactivation domain; inhibition of FOXM1 transcriptional activity by the peptide caused selective apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma over\u2010expressing FOXM1 and a reduced proliferation and angiogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma regions but not in the adjacent normal liver tissue in mice.45 The other is an antibiotic thiazole compound Siomycin A; this antibiotic inhibits anchorage\u2010independent growth and selectively induces apoptosis in FOXM1\u2010transformed cells.46 They could be potential anticancer drugs, although these results were based on the experiments with cell lines or transgenic mice.",
