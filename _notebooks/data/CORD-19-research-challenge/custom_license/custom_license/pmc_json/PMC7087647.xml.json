Due to the prevalence of H1N1 type strain, the CDC stopped widespread testing for the H1N1 influenza virus (CDC 2009a, b, c, d, e, f, g). On 24 October 2009, the US government declared the swine flu outbreak a national emergency, thereby allowing hospital and local governments to speedily set up alternate sites for treatment and triage procedures if needed to handle any surge of patients (Calmes and McNeil 2009).",

One study done earlier in 2009 among US military beneficiaries about the epidemiologic characteristics of novel H1N1 clearly showed that the strain appeared to preferentially affect adolescent and young adults between 15 and 24 years of age (Crum-Cianflone et al. 2009). At the inception of the epidemic, there were no vaccines available. Later, there were vaccines available free of charge for H1N1 influenza, and the CDC recommended the vaccine as the best preventive measure against H1N1 (CDC 2009a, b, c, d, e, f, g). Transmissibility of the H1N1 virus has been shown to be substantially higher than that of seasonal flu (Fraser et al. 2009). Thus, it has become imperative to educate the public about measures of prevention of transmission of the H1N1 virus in order to mitigate its impact on the population.",

            "text": "Encouraging the public to undertake specific behaviors related to hygiene has proved useful in containing previous outbreaks of infectious diseases (Fung and Cairncross 2006). Motivating the public to adopt such behaviors as well as sustaining them can become daunting challenges. Studies of how people responded to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 suggest that perceptions or beliefs about an outbreak may be important in determining compliance with official advice. Different authors have cited the Health Belief Model (Lau et al. 2003; Tang and Wong 2003; Janz and Becker 1984; Rosenstock et al. 1988; Tang and Wong 2004; Lau et al. 2007) and the public\u2019s response during the outbreak of SARS (Lau et al. 2003; Tang and Wong 2003; Tang and Wong 2004; Lau et al. 2007) to suggest that people may be more likely to comply with health-related recommendations if they believe the following: the effects of the disease are severe; the recommended behaviors are effective (Tang and Wong 2004; Lau et al. 2007; Janz and Becker 1984); they are susceptible (Janz and Becker 1984; Rosenstock et al. 1988; Tang and Wong 2004); the illness is difficult to treat (Lau et al. 2007); the government is providing clear and sufficient information about the outbreak and can be trusted to control the spread of infection (Tang and Wong 2003); and there are few barriers to action (Janz and Becker 1984; Rosenstock et al. 1988). In addition, a higher level of anxiety or worry may be associated with an increase in behavior changes (Leung et al. 2005). Thus, understanding the role of specific perceptions in motivating people to engage in precautionary behavior may help health communicators improve their messages about outbreaks of new infectious disease generally and H1N1 specifically (Rubin et al. 2009).",
