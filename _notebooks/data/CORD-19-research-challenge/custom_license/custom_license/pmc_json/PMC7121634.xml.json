Data capture without our knowledge or consent has become pervasive, leaving people across the planet concerned and in some cases even outraged. Calls abound for laws prohibiting collection and storage of data without consent and for firm punishments for violations. In the United States ethical and legal arguments are made by privacy advocates to limit the collection and use of personally identifiable information. These arguments are backed by this country\u2019s foundational liberal political approach to government, its belief that self-determination far exceeds anything other- or government-determined, and its extreme favor of autonomy.",

            "text": "Public health surveillance has been used for hundreds of years to monitor and improve community health at the local, national, and international levels. Recognizable elements of public health surveillance were seen first in the United States in 1741 when the colony of Rhode Island required reports to health officials from tavern keepers about persons with \u201ccontagious diseases,\u201d as indicated by coughing, sneezing, and fever (Thacker 2010). Tavern keepers were required to report instead of health care providers, as persons were more often seen by the former than the latter. By 1874 Massachusetts became the first state to enact voluntary weekly reporting of infectious conditions using postcards (Bowditch et al. 1915) \u2013 a method that was used by states for over 100 years, replaced by telephone reporting in the late 1980s and digital reporting in the 2000s. It was after two severe epidemics in the early twentieth century \u2013 poliomyelitis and influenza \u2013 that all states began participating in national morbidity reporting (National Office of Vital Statistics 1953). Public health surveillance is defined as the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health-related data with the a priori purpose of preventing or controlling disease or injury, or identifying unusual events of public health importance, followed by the dissemination and use of information for public health action (Lee and Thacker 2011).",

While deciding what data elements to collect, the epidemiologist also must consider what types of analyses will be necessary to examine the public health question at hand to ensure the needed data are collected about each case.

Most states adopt a subset of conditions deemed reportable by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), a group constituted by state epidemiologists from each state, in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). As of August 2011, CSTE recommended that states require 8 conditions be reported as extremely urgent (within 4 h), including anthrax, botulism, plague, paralytic poliomyelitis, SARS-associated coronavirus, smallpox, tularemia, and viral hemorrhagic fevers. In addition, they recommended 11 urgent conditions to be reported within 24 h and 61 standard conditions to be reported electronically within 7 days (www.cste.org). The list of conditions that are reportable by health care providers to the state health department varies somewhat by state, but a core set of conditions is reported by all jurisdictions. Once collated at the state health department, reports are then deidentified and forwarded to CDC for national-level public health action.",

Instead of waiting until a specific condition is diagnosed, public health officials can combine information from signs and symptoms, exposures to infectious agents or environmental conditions, and health-related behaviors to identify unusual patterns in groups or communities that might indicate an impending concern for which planning and decision making can begin before cases are diagnosed. Depending on how closely related these pre-disease indicators are to the development of an actual case of the condition of concern, there will be some proportion of false-positives (persons with the pre-disease indicator who do not develop the condition). The further an indicator is from the development of the condition, the higher the proportion of false-positives.",

Numerous \u2018syndromes\u2019 have been identified by astute clinicians reporting unusual symptoms to their state epidemiologists and to CDC through their public health surveillance systems (Goodman et al. 2012). In recent history, public health professionals identified a number of important and new conditions using syndromic surveillance including Reye\u2019s syndrome in 1936, Legionnaires\u2019 disease in 1976, Lyme disease in 1977, toxic shock syndrome in 1978, HIV/AIDS in 1981, and SARS in 2003 (Goodman et al. 2012). The definition of public health surveillance and many state statutes specify a requirement to report unusual events of public health importance in addition to the list of conditions a health care provider must report. This allows for the early recognition of unknown syndromes or identification of associated risk factors and etiology that can then be used to initiate public health actions for prevention and control.",

Which specific diseases and conditions are subject to reporting is decided through an annual consensus process involving state epidemiologist-members of CSTE and subject matter experts at CDC. CSTE maintains the list of recommended reportable conditions and states decide whether to adopt the reporting requirement. Ultimately individual state input determines what conditions make their list and most states have a provision for unusual or unknown conditions of concern. States update their list of reportable conditions in different ways, depending on whether it is law, regulation, or rule that determines reportability. More states are adopting a flexible model that allows easier additions to and subtractions from the list of reportable conditions, by, for example, using a rule change instead of the creation and passage of an entirely new law.",

These new technologies \u2013 photography and the mass printing and distribution of daily newspapers \u2013 led to major changes in how people learned private details about each other\u2019s lives (DeCew 2012).

Medicine focuses on the individual as patient, whereas public health focuses on community or population as patient: The health of the individual matters in clinical practice and the health of the community matters in public health practice. By definition, then, clinicians see patients they know (or can come to know), whereas public health practitioners provide interventions for persons most of whom they never see or meet and who remain largely unknown to them.Medicine historically is concerned with curative interventions, either chemotherapeutic or procedural, whereas public health is primarily concerned with prediction, anticipation, and prevention. Public health\u2019s tools are not prescriptions or surgeries, but policy and law, behavioral-change strategies, sanitation, and adjustments to the built environment.Clinical medicine relies on a small number of similar disciplines with similar training to carry out its tasks.

The use of Mill\u2019s harm principle to support autonomy as the supreme value stems largely from the field of bioethics and its narrow misinterpretation of Mill\u2019s thoughts on liberty (Dawson and Verweij 2008). Mill indeed stated that, \u201cthe only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others\u201d (Mill 1859, p. 14). But to stop there is akin to misquoting, as Mill goes on to state: His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise, or even right. These are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoning with him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for compelling him, or visiting him with any evil in case he do otherwise. To justify that, the conduct from which it is desired to deter him, must be calculated to produce evil to someone else. The only part of the conduct of anyone, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign. (Mill 1859, p. 14)\n",

This collection and use of data requires that the public participate, and public participation requires public trust. Gostin proposed national-level policy changes that support collecting health data under uniform rules that protect individual privacy to reconcile the \u201cequally compelling public and private claims from the ethical and constitutional perspectives\u201d (Gostin 2001, p. 332). Scientists and clinicians cannot maximize public health or clinical care benefits without access to public health data, and access to those data depends on the public\u2019s trust that they are protected from both rogue access and inappropriate use. The secure space for private information to be used for public good is provided by policies that constrain the use of data to those purposes for which they were intended and protect data from unauthorized access.",

My colleagues and I examined the question of whether public health surveillance without patient consent is supported by the principles of public health ethics (Lee et al. 2012). We posited that public health surveillance would be ethically justified if its practices \u201c[met] the affirmative and refrain[ed] from violating negative operating principles\u201d of the existing public health ethics frameworks (Lee et al. 2012, p. 41). Although based on different theoretical underpinnings, several common operating principles emerged from the 13 public health ethics frameworks we reviewed. The common ethical principles included community, justice, interdependence, duty, human rights, autonomy, imposing minimal interference, ensuring intervention is necessary and effective, providing evidence that benefits outweigh infringement, reducing inequities, transparency, and inclusiveness. We then evaluated the best practices for the seven steps of public health surveillance and concluded that \u201ca well-designed public health surveillance system that engages affected communities, collects the minimum data necessary, stores data securely, and uses data for public health action (Lee et al. 2012, p. 43)\u201d is supported by contemporary public health ethics frameworks even when conducted without explicit patient consent.",

The foundation for this approach is Rawls\u2019s view that persons living in a pluralistic society have basic interests regardless of their conception of a good life and that therefore supersede personal interests based solely on their conception of a good life (Rawls 2001). Health, maximized in large part through public health, is one of these interests, and unless another person\u2019s basic interests are at stake, activities that promote society\u2019s basic interests are generally justifiable, perhaps obligatory. Rubel offers several conditions that temper the permissibility of public health interventions that promote health as a basic interest, and calls this the \u201cunreasonable exercise argument\u201d (Rubel 2012, p. 12). This argument allows for conditions where persons could justify a privacy claim over a public health good, specifically where there are important personal interests the exercise of which would not unreasonably burden the basic health interest. Using this approach, Rubel argues that public health interventions \u2013 including public health surveillance \u2013 that are necessary to further the basic interest of health are justified when implementation does not impose on another person\u2019s basic interests.",

The role of a government in protecting and enhancing the health of its people, thus meeting a basic interest of its population, is clear when the activities necessary are those that individuals cannot implement themselves.
