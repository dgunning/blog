Worryingly, 2459 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have now been identified outside of China.[6]",

One cohort study of patients during the SARS outbreak showed that the use of pulsed high-dose methylprednisolone was associated with clinical improvement in patients with SARS.[10] In another study of 20 patients with SARS, certain cytokine levels (interleukin-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and Th1 chemokine interferon-\u03b3-inducible protein-10) were found to be reduced after 5 to 8 days of glucocorticoid therapy.[11] However, a previous retrospective study indicated that pulsed doses of methylprednisolone was a risk factor associated with increased 30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio 26.0; 95% confidence interval, 4.4\u2013154.8; P = 0.001).[12] In addition, a further retrospective observational study found that glucocorticoid therapy in patients with MERS was associated with delayed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) RNA clearance.[13] The clinical, therapeutic, and other effects of systemic glucocorticoid therapy in patients with COVID-19 is not currently clear, and the case for and against the use of systemic glucocorticoids in severe cases of COVID-19 warrants further investigation.",

PASS software version 15 (NCSS, LLC; Kaysville, UT, USA) will be used with a power of 80% and a level of 95% confidence. Considering a dropout rate of 5%, the sample size is estimated to be 24 cases in each group. A randomized controlled trial in 2003 aimed to compare the plasma SARS-CoV RNA concentrations in patients in an early hydrocortisone-treated group with patients in a placebo group.[18] This study only enrolled a total of 17 subjects because it was conducted at the end of the SARS outbreak, and fewer appropriate patients were available to be recruited. Taking into account the uncertainty of the duration of the outbreak, the final sample size may be adjusted. Unlike Wuhan, Chongqing currently has a relatively small number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, and an even smaller number of severe cases of COVID-19. It is hoped that we do eventually recruit a cohort of 48 patients for our study, but we may have to settle for an even smaller cohort, should suitable subjects not be available.",

Unfortunately, the stated study was not a randomized controlled trial, and is thus open to the possibility of bias having an impact on outcomes.[23] However, there were also staunch advocates for not using systemic glucocorticoids in these patients. One systematic review of studies on patients with SARS-CoV, including 29 studies documenting glucocorticoid use, found 25 studies that were inconclusive regarding the role of the adjunctive use of glucocorticoids, and four studies demonstrated that the use of systemic glucocorticoids in patients with SARS may cause possible harm.[28] A prospective, randomized double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial compared early hydrocortisone treatment (before day 7 of the illness) with placebo, finding that early hydrocortisone therapy was associated with a higher subsequent plasma viral load.[18] Meanwhile, many possible complications of glucocorticoid use, such as profound immunosuppression, with the possible emergence of severe commensal and other viral and bacterial infections, invasive fungal infections, osteonecrosis, and psychosis may occur with prolonged and high-dose glucocorticoid therapy.[29-34]",

The use of hydrocortisone improves lung function in sepsis-associated ARDS, but no significant survival benefit has been observed in these patients.[46] A higher mortality rate has been observed in patients with ARDS who took high-dose glucocorticoids within 7 days after hospital admission, compared with those who were treated without high-dose glucocorticoid.[47]",
