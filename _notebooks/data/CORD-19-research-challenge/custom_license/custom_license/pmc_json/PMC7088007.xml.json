Our data also demonstrated a duration of HMPV shedding of at least 7\u201310 days, followed by a substantial drop in viral load. This suggests that the virus peaks during the first week of the illness, and, therefore, may have implications for infection control practices. We were also able to quantify the HMPV viral load by using weekly nasal swabs and real-time RT-PCR methods. We believe that the data presented here are unique to address the serial quantitative viral load associated with HMPV infection. By looking at repeated viral loads during an acute illness and showing a significant drop in levels over time, it may suggest a decrease in infectivity specifically for HMPV. The same data also suggests that, similar to RSV, young children could have a sufficient amount of virus to be potentially contagious even after 2 weeks of infection.",
