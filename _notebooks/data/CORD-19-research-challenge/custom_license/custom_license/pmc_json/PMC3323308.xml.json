Subsequent publications demonstrated that this new coronavirus was detectable in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (5,6), classified according to the World Health Organization's case definition (7). During the first 6 months of 2003, a total of 8,422 patients were affected. This fact, together with the reappearance of the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in China in late 2003, makes it clear that rapid and reliable diagnostic tools are essential for accurate disease reporting and subsequent disease management.",

However, the genomes of RNA viruses, including those of coronaviruses, tend to vary over time and with location (9\u201312). Recently, the sequence variations of SARS-CoV during the first epidemic phases in China in 2003 were reported. The neutral mutation rate for SARS-CoV was almost constant and similar to that of known RNA viruses; the S protein, responsible for virus-host receptor recognition, displayed the most extensive amino acid changes (13). In addition, the sequence analysis of isolates from recent SARS patients in China in 2004 has shown that 98.8%\u201399.4% of the 3,768 bases of S gene, 99% of 658 bases of M gene, and 99% of 1,068 bases of N gene are isogenous with those submitted to public databases, which date back to the first epidemic in spring 2003 (14). However, even these minimal changes could render existing PCR assays ineffective should SARS-CoV reemerge (15).",

This system allowed the simultaneous detection of different SARS-CoV regions in a single PCR run. Moreover, we could combine the three assays in a single tube, which might be important when clinical material is limited.

Results are shown in Table 2. Detection limits of the three new assays were <10 GE. Comparison of the threshold cycle (CT) values showed that the new assays were at least as sensitive as the previously described assays (5,8) and the commercially available kit. When we combined the assays in a single tube targeting three different regions on the same RNA template, the CT was reduced by 1 to 2 cycles (SDS7700), which suggests either that sensitivity was unchanged or, when there was an increase, that it was attributable to the combination of all three signals (LightCycler). Subsequent agarose gel analysis during optimization steps of the PCR confirmed the simultaneous amplification of the three RT-PCR products (Figure).",

Parallel amplification of two human reference genes, L13 and cyclophilin, confirmed negative results in clinical samples by demonstrating amplifiable RNA. The separation of the control reaction was chosen to guarantee the high sensitivity of the SARS-CoV detection of <10 GE of SARS-CoV per reaction. An RT-PCR run is completed in <1 h, depending on the real-time PCR platform. In cases of small amounts of material or in an emergency situation with a high throughput of samples, the three SARS-CoV\u2013specific assays can be combined into one RT-PCR reaction without loss of sensitivity. Furthermore, as the ambiguous diagnostic results in a hospital in Canada have recently shown (17), targeting three different regions distributed over the whole genome considerably reduces the risk for false-negative results caused by virus sequence modifications.",

No fluorescence signal was observed for control pathogens. In the inset, the respective agarose gel analysis of the amplification products in a 3% gel is shown. Lane 1: 50-bp marker, lane 2: 500 GE SARS-CoV amplified with the assay combination (products of assays NS pp1ab and SS GP are not clearly distinguishable because of sizes of 88 bp and 79 bp, respectively), lane 3: human CoV 229E, lane 4: respiratory syncytial virus, lane 5: rhinovirus, lane 6: human metapneumovirus, lane 7: Mycoplasma pneumoniae, or lane 8: Chlamydia pneumoniae.",
