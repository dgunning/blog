The reflex is controlled within the brainstem by a central pattern generator, loosely termed the \u2018vomiting centre\u2019, located in the area dorsomedial to the retrofacial nucleus which initiates a co\u2010ordinated stimulation and inhibition of relevant motor nuclei (Fukuda and Koga 1991 [2b], Fukuda and Koga 1992 [2b], Koga and others 1998 [2b]). Direct projections from this region to motor nuclei such as the caudal part of the ventral respiratory group have been identified (Koga and Fukuda 1997 [2b]). The reflex has visible phases of hypersalivation, retching and expulsion (Figure 1). Efferent pathways controlling these processes include the vagal and phrenic nerves, parasympathetic nerves to the salivary glands and somatic motor nerves to abdominal muscles [OEG B].",

Release of 5\u2010hydroxytryptamine/serotonin (5\u2010HT) from enterochromaffin cells, which have been demonstrated in canine gastric and duodenal mucosa, stimulates vagal afferents via 5\u2010HT3 receptors (Fukui and others 1992 [2b], Fukui and others 1993a [2b]). It seems that other pathways and local modulatory signals are also important (Lang and others 1988 [2b], Sanger and Andrews 2006 [3a]). Peripheral emetogenic triggers may be abrogated by bilateral vagotomy, effects which are enhanced when combined with ablation of the greater splanchnic nerves, suggesting more than one signal pathway (Fukui and others 1993b [2b]). Vagal afferents, carrying peripheral emetogenic signals, enter the rostral medulla oblongata and pass via the solitary tract to the nucleus of the solitary tract (Fukuda and Koga 1991 [2b], Koga and Fukuda 1992 [2b]).

This region, lacking a blood\u2010brain barrier, is responsive to circulating emetogens. A number of receptor types have been noted in the area postrema of the dog including dopamine (Stafanini and Clement\u2010Cormier 1981 [2b]), histamine (Bhargava and others 1976 [2b]) and peptide YY (Leslie and others 1988 [2b]). Numerous chemicals, that can induce emesis when administered systemically, also do so via direct application to the area postrema. These include apomorphine, xylazine, prostaglandins and various hormones and peptides (Briggs and Carpenter 1986 [3b], Carpenter and others 1983 [3b], Carpenter and others 1988 [2b], Carpenter and Briggs 1986 [2b], Hikasa and others 1987 [2b]). Ablation of the area postrema inhibits the emetogenic effects of these substances (Carpenter and Briggs 1986 [2b]). Emetogenic signals from the area postrema excite neurones of the nucleus of the solitary tract in the area subpostrema and, from there, the central pattern generator of the vomiting reflex (Koga and Fukuda 1992 [2b]).

Ablation of the area postrema was thought to stop emetogenic responses to motion, but later critique suggested that a lack of specificity in ablation may have damaged associated structures, possibly the nucleus of the solitary tract, which modulated emetic signals from the inner ear (Borison 1985 [5,] Wang and Chinn 1954 [5]).

Aspiration pneumonia can occur secondary to vomiting (Kogan and others 2006 [4a]). Persistent vomiting that prevents effective oral intake of food is likely to lead to protein\u2010calorie malnutrition (see \u2018Dietary management\u2019).

Breed is an important consideration; Belgian shepherd dogs have a breed predisposition for gastric carcinoma (Scanziani and others 1991 [4c]), chronic hypertrophic pyloric gastropathy is seen more often in certain toy breeds (Bellenger and others 1990 [4c], Walter and others 1985 [4c]), and hypoadrenocorticism in the Nova Scotia Duck tolling retriever (Hughes and others 2007 [4b]). There are many more breed predilections that can be mentioned. Some diseases also have a gender predilection e.g. hypoadrenocorticism is more commonly seen in female dogs (Kintzer and Peterson 1997 [3a]) and some diseases exclusively affect one gender (e.g. pyometra, prostatitis).",

Dogs with simple, mild, acute self limiting emesis do not need further work\u2010up, and can be treated symptomatically. Many of these animals are not seriously ill, and may need no treatment. A recent study suggests 95% of dogs with emesis do not present to the veterinary surgeon (Hubbard and others 2007 [4a]). Even in those that present to a veterinary surgeon, in most cases of acute self limiting emesis, the aetiology is never determined: diet\u2010related factors (dietary indiscretion), infectious agents and toxins are considered the most important causes.

These authors showed that in 89% of dogs with signs of vomiting, signs resolved in less than two days. The clinician should judge the need for further investigation and treatment; a suggested approach is summarized in the algorithm (Figure 2). Emesis may be a desirable outcome following toxic ingestion, and anti\u2010emetics, especially where there is also a pro\u2010kinetic effect, are not indicated where there is gastrointestinal obstruction. To minimise the risk of anti\u2010emetics masking significant clinical signs it is important to initially identify those cases requiring further investigation and to ensure effective follow\u2010up examinations are planned to reassess the progress of cases that are treated symptomatically. A risk benefit assessment should be made of the likely success of a particular drug in preventing and treating emesis versus the likelihood of the drug inducing adverse effects.",

In many clinical situations e.g. uraemia, emesis may occur because of a combination of stimuli (central and peripheral). The relative importance of the different pathways may or may not be apparent from the clinical presentation or diagnosis. The ideal drug will, therefore, prevent both central and peripheral stimuli of the \u2018vomiting centre\u2019 (see section \u2018Causes of vomiting\u2019). In addition, because persistent and/or severe emesis can result in significant fluid loss and electrolyte disturbances, the ideal antiemetic drug should be without effect on the cardiovascular system since actions here can upset the delicate haemodynamic balance in a dehydrated patient. Furthermore, a drug with a very wide therapeutic index would be desirable, particularly as emesis can be associated with kidney and liver disease, two major organ systems involved in the clearance of drugs from the body. Drugs with narrow therapeutic indices would be unsafe to administer to dogs with significant kidney or liver dysfunction. In addition central nervous system side\u2010effects, such as sedation, might be undesirable in drugs used treat emesis because changes in central nervous system (CNS) function may make diagnosis of the underlying cause of the emesis or assessment of the progression of the dog's condition difficult and, potentially, predispose to adverse events such as aspiration. Finally, a lack of direct effects of an antiemetic on GI motility would be desirable in most cases, although a prokinetic effect may be beneficial in some conditions such as chronic gastritis.",

In clinical practice across Europe, a number of antiemetics may be used, such as metoclopramide (orally or by infusion), domperidone, ondansetron and acepromazine. Many of these drugs are in routine clinical use and are generally considered to be effective and useful, but few have been subjected to rigorous testing and there is a dearth of clinical evidence to support the efficacy of many of these antiemetic drugs under field conditions. A systematic search of the literature for \u2018antiemetics AND dogs\u2019 (limited to clinical trials) yielded 97 papers, only 5 of which were true clinical trials involving field cases in veterinary practice. Moore and others (1994 [1b]) examined the antiemetic effects of butorphanol and cyproheptadine in clinical cases of lymphoma receiving cisplatin and demonstrated butorphanol was moderately effective. Valverde and others (2004 [1b]) demonstrated the value of pre\u2010treating with acepromazine in preventing opiate\u2010induced emesis in dogs receiving opiates as part of a pre\u2010anaesthetic protocol. The other three papers involved the neurokinin\u20101 (NK\u20101) receptor antagonist, maropitant. De La Puente\u2010Redondo and others (2007a [1b]) conducted a clinical trial examining the ability of antiemetic drugs to arrest emesis due to medical conditions in dogs under field conditions. In both phases maropitant performed significantly better than metoclopramide, both in terms of a lower proportion of dogs that vomited after administration of the antiemetic and the number of emetic events recorded in those dogs that vomited. Vail and others (2007 [1b]) examined the effect of maropitant on frequency of emesis in clinical patients receiving cisplatin, given at a higher dose than in the study of Moore and others (1994 [1b]), and demonstrated that maropitant prevented emesis and also suggested efficacy to treat and prevent nausea induced by chemotherapy, as evaluated by a visual analogue scale. The final clinical trial also involved maropitant and examined its ability to prevent motion sickness in dogs prone to this problem (Benchaoui and others 2007 [1b]). This was a large multicentre placebo controlled clinical trial which demonstrated that maropitant reduced the number of dogs vomiting on the journey when compared to placebo.",

Stimuli which cause vomiting can also reach the CNS through the blood stream (e.g. toxins \u2013 central emetogens; e.g. apomorphine) to stimulate the chemoreceptor trigger zone.
