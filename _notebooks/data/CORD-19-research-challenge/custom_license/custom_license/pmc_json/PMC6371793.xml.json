They are a common cause of respiratory tract infections, which are the third leading cause of death worldwide (and the most deadly communicable diseases). Current options to prevent or clear respiratory virus infections are limited and have notable shortcomings. For example, the effectiveness of vaccination against seasonal influenza A virus (IAV) usually hovers around 50\u201360%,1 and there is often a 6\u2010month delay between strain identification and vaccine production.2 There is currently no vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Few antiviral drugs are presently approved for treating respiratory virus infections and most are IAV neuraminidase inhibitors.3 For individuals suffering from the chronic airway diseases asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), respiratory virus infections can cause debilitating, and potentially deadly, exacerbations. In addition to acute disease, frequent and severe respiratory viral infections in youth have been implicated in detrimental airway remodeling and in the development of chronic diseases asthma and COPD in adulthood.4 Thus, there is a current unmet need to develop new antivirals to treat respiratory virus infections.",

To subvert this process, host cells encode several interferon (IFN)\u2010inducible antiviral factors that constitute a potent battery of innate immune defense.

BST\u20102 also partially restricts the human pathogens PIV2,35 hCoV\u2010229E,36 and SARS,37 and this restriction is enhanced by deletion of viral antagonists.

Despite this lack of information, differences of a single amino acid have been reported to switch a restricted IAV VLP to one not inhibited by BST\u20102.18 Interactions appear to be mediated between the ectodomains of the two proteins. However, this interaction does not appear to promote surface removal of BST\u20102. A more recent study suggests the IAV M2 channel protein is a BST\u20102 antagonist.34 In contrast to neuraminidase, this interaction promotes surface removal of BST\u20102, ending in proteasomal degradation. In addition, IAV encodes the general IFN\u2010I antagonist NS1, which can broadly inhibit expression of ISGs. NS1 may partially inhibit BST\u20102 via this broadly targeted strategy.31, 32 PIV2 encodes the V protein, which targets BST\u20102 for surface removal, but does not appear to catalyze proteasomal destruction of BST\u20102.35 PIV2V may also prevent viral\u2010mediated induction of BST\u20102.65 SARS\u2010CoV encodes ORF7a, which binds BST\u20102 via interaction of their ectodomains.37 This interaction appears to inhibit maturation of BST\u20102 glycosylation, which prevents surface expression. Infection of cells with hCoV\u2010229E promotes surface removal of BST\u20102, but the mechanism and viral protein involved are unknown.36 SeV infection promotes proteasomal degradation of BST\u20102.

In addition to its function as a viral tethering protein, BST\u20102 also acts as an innate immune viral sensor that signals and triggers activation of NF\u2010\u03baB to elicit production of inflammatory cytokines that alert neighboring cells, extending its protection abilities to adjacent cells by inducing production of antiviral proteins. Clustering of BST\u20102 captured in budding virions initiates assembly of a signaling pathway that causes NF\u2010\u03baB activation.66, 67 This clustering creates the formation of a specialized signaling motif called a HemITAM including residues Y6 and Y8 in the BST\u20102 CT, which recruit Src\u2010family kinases and become phosphorylated (Figure 3). The phosphorylation specifically recruits the kinase Syk, which then assembles a signaling complex composed of adaptors TRAF2 and TRAF6, as well as TAK1, and culminates in downstream activation of NF\u2010\u03baB.68 BST\u20102 is coupled to the actin cytoskeleton via interaction with the BAR and Rho\u2010GAP containing protein RICH2, which binds the BST\u20102 CT. Mutations that inhibit this interaction prevent or reduce phosphorylation of BST\u20102 and subsequent downstream NF\u2010\u03baB activation.68, 69 Thus, it appears that pre\u2010concentration of BST\u20102 on the cell surface is required for efficient clustering by viruses. This signaling can induce expression of inflammatory and antiviral signaling cytokines IFN\u2010\u03b2, CXCL10, and IL\u20106.68 Virus\u2010encoded BST\u20102 antagonists have varying effects on BST\u20102\u2010mediated activation of NF\u2010\u03baB, which appears to be linked to the ability to direct degradation of BST\u20102. HIV\u20101 Vpu, which targets BST\u20102 for surface removal and destruction, also prevents BST\u20102\u2010mediated activation of NF\u2010\u03baB.67, 70 However, Ebola GP and HIV2 Env, which engage BST\u20102 to inhibit its viral tethering ability but do not direct its degradation, do not inhibit this signaling ability of BST\u20102.71 The impact of antagonists encoded by respiratory viruses on BST\u20102\u2010mediated NF\u2010\u03baB activation has not been investigated.",

In this capacity, it serves as a ligand for the inhibitory receptor ILT\u20107, which is exclusively expressed on pDCs (Figure 3). Circulating pDCs produce IFN\u2010I in response to virus\u2010derived TLR7/9 stimulation, which then initiates the antiviral state in infected and surrounding cells, including upregulation of BST\u20102 expression. The BST\u20102 expressed on infected and neighboring cells can then engage ILT\u20107 on the surface of pDCs, which signals through FcR\u03b3I to shut down production of IFN\u2010I in a negative\u2010feedback manner to prevent overstimulation.72 HIV\u20101 Vpu appears to exploit this mechanism by specifically targeting BST\u20102 clustered to viral budding sites for destruction, and enriching distribution of BST\u20102 outside of the viral budding site, thus enhancing the probability of BST\u20102/ILT7 interaction to suppress pDC antiviral response.73 This interaction has also been suggested to occur in cis between ILT7 and BST\u20102 both expressed on the surface of pDCs, possibly to prevent premature maturation.14\n",
