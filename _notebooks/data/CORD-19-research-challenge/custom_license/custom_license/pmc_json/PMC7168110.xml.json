Observations to date suggest that influenza A and B continuously evolve through antigenic drift, while only influenza A evolves through antigenic shift (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/gen-info/flu-viruses.htm). Antigenic drift is a gradual process of change via point mutations that lead to novel strains of viruses. It explains why people and animals can be infected by the same virus type (e.g., influenza B) more than once. Namely, the host response to an infecting strain may not grant immunity to new strains that have emerged through antigenic drift (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/gen-info/flu-viruses.htm). Antigenic shift, on the other hand, is a more dramatic process resulting from genetic reassortment, which occurs when influenza viruses exchange genetic material. This abrupt process can occur when two or more influenza A viruses infect a single human or animal host (http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/information_h1n1_virus_qa.htm). Antigenic shift can lead to a global influenza pandemic if three conditions are met: (1) a new influenza A subtype is introduced into the human population, (2) the virus causes serious illness in humans, and (3) the virus can easily spread from person to person in a sustainable manner (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/gen-info/flu-viruses.htm).

In addition to the diagnostic and clinical research applications highlighted above, multiplex respiratory viral panels can have tremendous utility in surveillance programs.\n28\n, \n42\n The preventive and therapeutic strategies that emerge from epidemiological information gathered through such programs will be augmented by the extensive data afforded through multiplex panels.",

Timely and accurate data on the multitude of pathogens that have been implicated in RTI and associated clinical conditions are paramount. Traditional methods such as cell culture still have a role to play in diagnostic algorithms; however, advances in nucleic acid amplification technologies have led to an increase in their adoption by clinical laboratories. Innovations linked to both real\u2010time and end\u2010point PCR have been particularly noteworthy. The innovations underlying xTAG RVP are an example of how advances in technology can be translated into clinical utility.",
