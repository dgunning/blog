Fear of SARS arose from the underlying anxiety about a disease with an unknown cause and possible fatal outcome (5). Stigmatization of potential SARS patients emerged early in the outbreak, as global media reported dramatic stories from Asia in print media, television, and the Internet. Headlines from the English-language press heightened the fear. \u201cConcern is mounting over the continuing spread of the deadly SARS virus. Some experts say it could have a similar impact to the 1918 flu epidemic that killed 50 million\u2014or the current world HIV crisis,\u201d wrote the British Broadcasting Corporation from London, England (6). \u201cChina has threatened to execute or jail for life anyone who deliberately spreads the killer SARS virus,\u201d stated the Cable News Network from Beijing, China (7).",

While exclusionary practices based upon the best available scientific evidence may be scientifically and ethically sound for one population, those same practices may not be sound for all populations (5,11). During the SARS outbreak, some persons became fearful or suspicious of all people who looked Asian, regardless of their nationality or actual risk factors for SARS, and expected them to be quarantined. Some Americans did not understand that quarantine and isolation practices appropriate for SARS-affected areas in Asia, where community transmission was a concern, were practices that were not appropriate in the United States where the disease was not community acquired. For example, some persons, who had recently traveled to areas where SARS was spreading, isolated themselves, even though they had no symptoms and had not been exposed to someone with SARS.",

This strategy works best as a complement to a larger public health education and communication campaign. Typically during outbreaks, initial risk communication is targeted to front-line public health professionals through vehicles such as the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Initial communication provides information on case definitions and laboratory-testing strategies, as well as interim guidelines for infection control and other critical issues. Communication strategies for the general public most frequently involve television sound bites, press conferences with dignitaries and health officials, and targeted release of information to mass media outlets such as newspapers and Internet sites (14). Although these risk communication activities are critical for keeping the general public informed during an outbreak, they can fail to meet the personal needs of the affected population and the general public.",

Passive data collection of SARS fear-related concerns began on April 29, 2003. During May 2003, 7,327 SARS-related calls were received; 4,013 (54.7%) of these calls were passively sampled. Of these sampled calls, an average of 10% of callers expressed concerns related to fear, stigmatization, and discrimination. A caller could express more than one concern. Major concerns included the following: fear of buying Asian merchandise (187 calls); working with Asians (83 calls); living near Asians (45 calls); going to school with Asians (41 calls); and more generic issus such as being on a cruise ship or airplane (77 calls); and church, school, or workplace issues (65 calls).

Team members monitored English-language and Asian-language electronic, print, and television media coverage and informal chat rooms in the United States and other countries to stay abreast of changing information about the nature of the SARS outbreak that could influence fear, stigmatization, and discrimination. The assessment showed that many people within the Asian-American community were getting information from Asian-language newspapers, television, and Internet sites directly from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and other Asian areas\u2014usually hours ahead of information providers in the United States. The information provided by these Asian-language sources was often inconsistent with newspaper, television, and Internet coverage in the United States, thus creating fear and suspicion that the United States government might not be telling the truth about the outbreak in this country. Independent content-analysis research conducted by InterTrend Communications (San Francisco, CA) compared four of the most popular Chinese language newspapers in the United States with two popular national mainstream English-language newspapers from March 21 to April 3, 2003 (15). InterTrend data showed that 1) Chinese-language newspapers were more likely to highlight SARS news related to the Chinese community in the United States or from China more prominently than mainstream English-language newspapers; and 2) Chinese-language newspapers were more likely to have articles on SARS, including featured in-depth articles, than mainstream English-language U.S. national newspapers (15). These findings supported the team\u2019s initial assessment (based on an informal convenience sample of Asian-language papers).",

Vital components of the team\u2019s activities were prioritizing and translating existing information and guidance documents and developing health education materials to address the specific needs of the Asian-American community. An in-house translation service did not exist, and the rapidly evolving scientific evidence challenged the turnaround time for developing, translating, and disseminating information. The team worked to identify priority documents for translation and to ensure Asian-language translation for Web and print products tailored to the Asian-American community. To ensure accurate translations, CDC contracted with professional translation services and had all documents back-translated. Web-based information on SARS included documents in traditional Chinese, simplified Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Japanese, as well as French and Spanish. The team also created brief, recorded educational hotline messages in Chinese and Vietnamese. The main messages for people in the United States were the following: 1) the risk of SARS is low; 2) severe cases of SARS have been uncommon, and there have been no deaths in the United States; 3) methods for disease prevention in the general public are like those of other viral diseases; and 4) although no evidence of community spread currently exists, continued vigilance, aggressive case management, and infection control are needed.",

The team met with community leaders, toured the communities, informally gathered further information, and gave community SARS presentations in seven cities, reaching approximately 500 persons. Through community visits, the team was able to 1) provide the latest in evidence-based information on SARS with Asian-language education materials; 2) dispel misconceptions, myths, and rumors; 3) act as a catalyst for bringing together a broad spectrum of organizations and persons in the community to create local networks to promote community resiliency; and 4) provide credibility and reassurance to those who felt vulnerable. Speakers also presented a public health model for mitigating fear, stigmatization, and discrimination that could be instituted by public health officials, clinicians, and community members. Through open discussion sessions and informal information gathering in the community, the team found that SARS-related stigmatization was occurring more frequently within the Asian community than from outsiders directed toward the Asian community. The team also found that those persons with SARS-like symptoms who used traditional herbal physicians and pharmacies were less likely to be referred to, or seek out, public health officials, suggesting that further research into strategies to reach this population is needed. Conducting community visits also showed that CDC was responding to the needs of the community at risk for SARS-related fear, stigmatization, and discrimination and was modeling positive behaviors to the public.",

Fear, stigmatization, and discrimination plagued Russian Jewish immigrants when the 1892 outbreaks of typhus fever and cholera in New York City were traced to Russian Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe (8). In the spring of 1900, the Chinatown community in San Francisco was faced with extreme discrimination due to an outbreak of bubonic plague, the \u201cblack death,\u201d attributed to rats transported on a ship from Hong Kong (9). In 1993 an outbreak of hantavirus infection in the Four Corners area (where the borders of four states\u2014Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado\u2014meet) of the United States was initially referred to by reporters as a Navajo disease, which led to severe fear, stigmatization, and discrimination of Native Americans in the region (10). Previous scientific studies have shown that fear associated with stigmatization and discrimination has negatively affected public health efforts with chronic conditions and diseases such as mental illness, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, leprosy, and epilepsy (16\u201320). More recently, stigmatization associated with fear and the AIDS epidemic negatively influenced voluntary testing, counseling, and treatment of those infected with the disease (21). Health providers have also seen reluctance by recent refugees and immigrants to get tested and treated for tuberculosis because of possible social stigmatization (22). The potential of being labeled at-risk for having or transmitting a stigmatizing condition such as SARS creates fear and anxiety, and an entire population of people can be at risk for becoming stigmatized in society (23).",
