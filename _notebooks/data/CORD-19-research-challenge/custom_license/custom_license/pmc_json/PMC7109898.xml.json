            "text": "Surgical smoke is an aerosol hazard unique to the surgical operating room (OR). It is generated by electrocautery used in virtually all standard surgical facilities as a means of performing surgical dissection of various tissues. Electrocautery is a process in which an electrical current is passed through a resistant metal wire electrode. The heated electrode is then applied to the tissue for dissection or hemostasis (Pollock et al., 2008). Given the positioning of surgical personnel over and around the surgical patient, surgical smoke is often directly in the path of their respiratory field. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) estimates that 500,000 workers are exposed to laser and electrocautery smoke each year (OSHA, 2007).",

Surgical smoke contains known carcinogens as well as viable biologic particles (Barrett and Garber, 2003). Carcinogenic and neurotoxic compounds were found in surgical smoke aerosols generated from porcine tissue as well as during human surgical procedures (Krones et al., 2007; Sahaf et al., 2007). A review by Biggins and Renfree (2002) reported the failure of SMs to provide appropriate protection to healthcare personnel and suggested establishing new standards to reduce the risks. Other studies have revealed that SMs are insufficient for providing adequate protection against surgical smoke (Barrett and Garber, 2003; Alp et al., 2006).",

            "text": "Exposure to surgical smoke aerosol has relevance to public health settings due to the presence of small particles. Weber et al. (1993) tested eight SMs and found that for fine particles (<1,000nm) the penetration through these masks ranged from 20% to nearly 100%. Studies conducted with two SMs sealed on a manikin headform indicated that for particles of 10\u201380nm in diameter (including MS2 virions), the filter penetration was 20.5\u201384.5% (Balazy et al., 2006a, b). Since SMs have a comparatively poor fit, faceseal (FS) leakage represents a prominent penetration pathway. This is especially true for small particles, e.g. those in the size range of influenza A virions (Booth et al., 2013) as well as virions causing Human Papilloma Virus (HPV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Although N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) are more efficient than SMs [their N95 filter is certified by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to allow no more than 5% penetration], penetration of ultrafine particles (<100nm) through some N95 FFRs may exceed this threshold (Balazy et al., 2006a). The highest filter penetration values were observed for particles of 30\u201370nm in diameter, which includes the size of several respiratory pathogenic virions (Zheng and Baker, 2006; Mettenleiter and Sobrino, 2008), as well as a substantial fraction of surgical smoke particles (Bruske-Hohlfeld et al., 2008; Andreasson et al., 2009).",

            "text": "NIOSH recommends combining general room ventilation with local exhaust ventilation (LEV) to control the airborne particles generated by surgical smoke (NIOSH, 1996). However, due to the variability of surgical smoke and its potential hazards, the implementation of personal protective equipment (PPE) is also needed to protect healthcare workers in ORs. The Association for periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN) recognizes the hazard of the surgical smoke. AORN also urges the use of PPE and evacuation and filtration of smoke through an appropriate system (AORN, 2016a,b,c). They recommend using fit-tested surgical N95 FFRs or high-filtration masks to protect against surgical smoke (AORN, 2008; Benson et al., 2013). However these recommendations are not regulatory requirements, and presently the use of N95 FFRs in ORs is primarily limited to procedures involving HPV. Overall, SMs remains the standard protection devices in ORs. Recently, so-called \u2018N95 surgical mask respirators\u2019 (SMRs) have been introduced. The SMRs are cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in ORs, and certified by NIOSH to receive an N95 grade (although the NIOSH does not evaluate FFRs for surgical use). However, little is known about the performance of either SMs or SMRs against surgical smoke. Rozzi et al. (2012) investigated the absorption capabilities of organic vapor FFRs against the aromatic hydrocarbons generated in surgical smoke, but neither this nor similar investigations addressed the particulate matter component. A higher grade FFR (N100) was pilot-studied against surgical smoke from porcine tissue (Koehler et al., 2014). One of these facepieces was modified by creating a FS made of ethylene vinyl acetate foam that was affixed to the inner perimeter of the respirator, replacing the stock face seal. The modification significantly improved the respirator performance by minimizing the FS leakage. It is acknowledged that N100 FFRs have limitations for deployment in ORs due to their exhalation valve component. However, it is still important to generate data about the efficiency of these highest grade facepieces against surgical smoke because it will help determine the feasibility of making appropriate design modifications to other respirators, e.g. N95 SMRs (that have no exhalation valves), in order to maximize their performance.",

The inlets of the two respective sampling lines were located 6cm from each other. The same sampling configuration was used in fit testing. The aerosol concentrations and particle size distributions of the inside- and outside-sampled aerosol (Cin and Cout respectively) were measured by a particle size spectrometer (Nanoparticle Aerosol Monitor/Mini Wide Range Aerosol Spectrometer, Model 1320, Grimm Technologies, Inc., Ainring, Germany) in combination with an optical particle counter (OPC) (Model 1.108, Grimm Technologies, Inc.). The inside and outside concentration measurements were controlled by a high speed two-way electromagnetic valve. The outside concentration was measured for 6min following by a 12-min inside measurement; subsequently, the outside concentration was measured again for 6min. The average concentration of the two 6-min outside concentration measurements was calculated and recorded as Cout. The average concentration of the continuous 12-min inside concentration measurement was calculated and recorded as Cin. The SWPF was determined as Cout/Cin. The data were recorded in a particle size range of 25\u20131,150nm. Based on the total aerosol concentrations measured across this size range, the total protection factor (SWPFtotal) was calculated. Additionally, the particle size selectivity of the aerosol measurement allowed determining SWPFs for different particle sizes (SWPFdp). These were recorded within a narrower range of 25\u2013290nm because the particle concentrations inside of the tested N95 and N100 FFRs were almost zero for particles larger than 290nm.

The curves have a similar shape; four of them peak at a particle size of 115nm observed and one at 145nm. The tests with other subjects generally generated similar particle size distribution curves although the total particle concentration levels were lower, which can be attributed to their limited experience in operating the electrocautery equipment. It was noticed that some subjects did not apply the electrocautery pencil to the tissue as frequently as it was demonstrated by surgeon, which could produce a lower level of smoke. With regard to the above between-subject variability and other factors influencing the aerosol concentration and particle size distribution in the breathing zone, it should be acknowledged that in an actual operating setting, electrocautery use in different surgical procedures involving various tissues would likewise have an effect on the concentration and particle size distribution of the generated surgical smoke.",

Additionally, the higher concentration measured in the present study may be attributed to lower air exchange rate established in our chamber.

The difference in SWPFtotal between SM1 and SM2 was not significant (P > 0.05, Table 2). Some particle size-selective SWPF values obtained for SMs were actually below 1, indicating that the aerosol concentrations inside the SMs were higher than outside. This counter-intuitive finding can be attributed to the fact that the same aerosol instrument was deployed alternating between the inside and outside measurements, which were conducted at different time points introducing an uncertainty, which affects the SWPF. The uncertainty is particularly apparent when the SWPF is close to 1. Overall, a very low efficiency of SMs observed in this study is consistent with previous reports (Dixon and Nelson, 1984; Zhuang et al., 2003; Reponen et al., 2011).",

Electret filters used in high-efficiency respirators offer very high protection against very small particles (20\u201330nm) as well as against much larger particles (>200nm) leaving the room for the most penetrating particle size (MPPS) in-between; the exact MPPS value depends on the filter characteristics and face velocity. This is consistent with the SWPF data shown for FS100 and N100 FFRs for which the particle size had a significant effect, indicating that an appreciable percentage of particles measured inside the respirator penetrated through the filter (relative to penetration through the FS leakage). In contrast, if the FS leakage served as the major penetration pathway, the penetration may not be significantly affected by the particle size, at least for the essentially inertialess surgical smoke particles. Thus, the data suggest that most of the particles, which penetrated through an SM or an N95 SMR, utilize the FS leakage pathway.",

Given the fact that the particle size was not a significant factor affecting the performance of SMs and SMRs, we concluded that the FS leakage was the main penetration pathway for the surgical smoke particles to enter into the tested SMs and the N95 SMRs.",
