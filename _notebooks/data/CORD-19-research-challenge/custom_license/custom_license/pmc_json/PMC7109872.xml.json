Reoviruses commonly infect humans; however, most reovirus infections are thought to be asymptomatic [1]. Previous studies and case reports have linked reovirus infections with minor upper respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms or with central nervous system disease in children [2\u20134\n]. An association between reovirus infection and neonatal extrahepatic biliary atresia has been suggested [5] but remains to be proven. Since few seroepidemiologic studies of reovirus exist, we determined the titers of reovirus-specific antibodies in young children residing in Nashville, Tennessee, from 1989 to 2001",

Healthy full-term infants were enrolled at birth and were followed until 5 years of age, although specimens were occasionally collected from older subjects. Children who developed chronic diseases other than mild asthma were excluded. Well and ill visits were conducted within the Vanderbilt General Clinical Research Center, with care provided by the pediatric infectious diseases faculty and nurse practitioners.

Mock-infected lysate prepared in the same manner was used as a control. The optimal viral antigen concentration for detection of reovirus-specific antibodies was determined by use of parallel assays. Rabbit polyclonal serum raised against \u03b1-catenin or coronavirus p12 or p22 was used as a negative control. Composition of blocking buffers, secondary antibody concentrations, and development times were optimized to maximize assay signal.

In this respect, reovirus would be similar to other viruses, such as hepatitis GB virus [9] and TT virus [10], which are not known to cause symptomatic infection. A certain small proportion of those infected, however, may develop severe clinical disease, including neonatal extrahepatic biliary atresia or meningitis [4, 5]. Since reoviruses display age-dependent virulence in experimental animals [11, 12], these severe manifestations would be anticipated to occur only in the very young.
