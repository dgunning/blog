For the third time in less than two decades the world is confronting a deadly and disruptive epidemic caused by a coronavirus.1,2 The first was the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002\u20132003. The second started unfolding in 2012 caused by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). SARS was contained through consistent, compulsive application of traditional public health measures (surveillance, detection, isolation of infected persons and quarantine of exposed). MERS still smolders (about 2500 cases confirmed globally) but has remained largely confined to the Middle East except for one well-documented outbreak (186 cases) traced to a traveller returning to South Korea from the Middle East.3 Both SARS and MERS have been associated with nosocomial transmission and super-spreader events, in which a single person infected many others.4 In December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases was reported to be linked to a seafood market in Wuhan, China. Now the world is confronting the emergence of 2019-nCoV, and on 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization declared it to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.",

The greatest danger is posed by pathogens that can spread by the respiratory route, especially if airborne spread occurs. Other factors that make control of a pathogen more difficult include transmissibility during asymptomatic, mild or pre-symptomatic periods. A long infectious period also makes control more challenging. The virus that has emerged in Wuhan combines characteristics that do not bode well for the human population. Based on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan, the mean incubation period was 5.2 days (potential range 2\u201314 days), the number of cases doubled every 7.4 days, and each case was estimated to infect 2.2 others.10 This basic reproductive number is similar to an estimate of 2.6 (uncertainty range: 1.5\u20133.5) reached by researchers with simulated epidemic trajectories using a mathematical model.11 Modelling results suggest that control measures would need to block >60% of transmission to control the outbreak.11 Based on observations with SARS and other infections, the basic reproductive number may decrease as people become aware of the threat of infection and change behaviour, but the basic reproductive number must drop <1 to stop the epidemic. The analysis based on the model suggests there will be ongoing sustained transmission in the absence of effective interventions.",
