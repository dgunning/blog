            "text": "Xenotransplantation is defined as \u201cAny procedure that involves the direct transplantation, implantation, or infusion into a human recipient of live cells, tissues, or organs from a non\u2010human animal source; or indirect exposure, where human body fluids, cells, tissues, or organs that have had ex vivo contact with live non\u2010human animal cells, tissues, or organs are administered\u201d.1 Interest in xenotransplantation into humans arose when it became increasingly clear that the demand for transplants far exceeds supply. There is general consensus that the porcine species is the species of choice, based on a number of factors including that in many organ systems, the physiology of pigs and humans is remarkably similar. Pigs can be bred and maintained in large numbers within enclosed, biosecure facilities, with large litter sizes being in order of ten piglets or more, time to sexual maturity being short (about 6\u20108 months), and gestation time being less than 4 months. Genetic engineering techniques have been developed and are being used to modify pigs via transgenesis, gene modification, and gene knock\u2010out (KO) technologies2, 3 to reduce immunogenicity and potentially improve safety. In our society, it appears to be ethically acceptable to use pigs as a source of cells, tissues, and organs for medical therapies.4, 5, 6 As a result of these factors, a porcine\u2010derived replacement pancreatic islet cell xenotransplantation product has now been used in patients with diabetes under national regulatory oversight7, 8, 9 demonstrating both safety and efficacy.10\n",

            "text": "There are stringent guidelines issued by regulatory agencies including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the generation and production of pigs for Xenotransplantation.11 Originally, the term specific (or specified) pathogen free (SPF) as it relates to swine production was not specifically created to help researchers but for pork producers to economically raise healthier animals under the premise that if the disease load can be lightened, better health and growth performance can be achieved.12 However, higher level and more extensive pathogen exclusion standards have been proposed for designated pathogen free (DPF) herds,11 with the notable exception of Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus (PERV), which due to its ubiquitous presence in the swine genome is risk managed via recipient monitoring,11, 13, 14 subtype, and transmission potential characterization,14 and recently potentially via genomewide inactivation.3 Animals fulfilling DPF status need to be free of infectious pathogens, not only those that affect the health of swine populations, but also those known and unknown agents that have the potential to infect humans and cause infectious disease, that is, having xenozoonotic potential.11 Examples of the latter category of potential pathogenic agents are porcine lymphotropic \u03b3\u2010herpes virus, hepatitis E, and porcine cytomegalovirus.13, 15 While no globally standardized DPF excluded agent list exists, there are a number of reports in the literature presenting lists of pathogens that should be eliminated from a DPF herd.16, 17, 18 To enable this pathogen exclusion, DPF\u2010free swineherds should be genetically closed and reared within biosecure barrier facilities, so\u2010called Source Animal Facilities (SAFs),11, 18 located distant from any other swine production or transport routes, and isolated from potential pathogen sources via filtered air, filtered and disinfected water, sterilized feed, shower\u2010in and shower\u2010out access for staff, and hygienic measures including thorough screening of employees for potentially transmissible pathogens prior to hiring (Table 1). To reduce the risk of prion\u2010based diseases, feed and feed components should be traceable and certified free of banned animal proteins or other cattle\u2010derived materials for multiple generations prior to donation.11 The operations in such a SAF should be according to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) conditions.11 It is also proposed that SAF animal husbandry conditions should follow those for research animals per the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\n19 with research facility registration and accreditation by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA, in the USA), the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC) respectively, and conduct of experiments under oversight of an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).",

            "text": "One of many agents on established DPF exclusion lists is porcine circovirus (PCV). This is a small, nonenveloped, single\u2010stranded DNA virus, first identified in 1974 as a contaminant of the porcine PK\u201015 kidney cell line, and it is the smallest known freely replicating virus in vertebrates.20 There are two major strains, PCV1 and PCV221 along with a newly recognized third strain PCV3 whose significance is still being discovered.22 PCV1 is not associated with disease, while PCV2 is associated with a spectrum of disease symptoms called porcine circovirus\u2010associated disease (PCVAD)20, 21 first recognized as post\u2010 weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome. Clinical signs include progressive weight loss, lethargy, dark\u2010colored diarrhea, lymphadenopathy, paleness, and jaundice. The hallmark lesion of PCV2 infection is lymphopenia in the blood circulation and lymphodepletion in lymphoid organs in which lymphoid cells are replaced by histiocytes with intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Cofactors in disease progression are multifold as PCV2 is immunosuppressive23 and include the composition of the virus itself; coinfection by viruses such as porcine parvovirus and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, and bacteria such as Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae\n24, 25 and host factors such as the breed of pigs, for example, purebred Landrace pigs being more susceptible than Duroc or Large White pigs.26 Both types of PCV have a widespread global presence in swineherds: Antibodies to PCV1 and PCV2 were detected in archived pig sera taken as early as the 1970s, although the first clinical disease outbreaks of PCV2 were first reported in the second half of the 1990s.21 The major route of transmission is via oral\u2010nasal contact with infected feces, urine, or with infected pigs, but the possibility of vertical transmission through the placenta has been reported in field studies27, 28, 29 and in experimental infection studies.30, 31 PCVAD is a globally established disease with a huge impact on pig production prior to widespread vaccine availability. PCV2\u2010specific vaccines became commercially available during the mid\u20102000s and proved efficacious in field trials.21 In our studies, we used a capsid\u2010based subunit vaccine marketed in North America under the name Circumvent\u00ae (Intervet Inc/Schering\u2010Plough Animal Health, Boxmeer, the Netherlands) that first became available in limited quantities during 2007. This vaccine showed efficacy in experimental studies32 and field investigations, that is, a reduction in mortality by 50% and increased weight gain upon vaccination of piglets at weaning and 3 weeks later.33 In one experimental study, effectiveness of immunization of the dam was investigated: Despite formation of antibodies after immunization at 4 weeks of gestation, virus inoculation at 8 weeks did not prevent transmission to the fetus.34\n",

Its zoonotic potential for man has not been clearly established, as circoviruses have been found in other species but not in humans.39 Exposure in humans has been claimed by serological testing for antibodies: About 20% of healthy adults and 30% of hospital patients with fever of unknown etiology were found to be antibody positive,40 but this has not been confirmed in other studies.41 Also, antibodies to PCV1 or PCV2 proved not detectable in a population of professionals with frequent, close contact to pigs, that is, veterinarians in swine practice.42 There are indications that the circovirus can infect some selected human cell lines during in vitro coculture, but this infection is non\u2010productive43 for primary human blood mononuclear cells, and there is conflicting data on susceptibility to in vitro infection.44, 45 From these data, it appears that the risk of zoonosis of PCV is rather small. In non\u2010human primate recipients of a porcine pancreatic islet product, there was no evidence observed for transmission of PCV46 and also patients who received clinical porcine islet transplants did not show evidence for PCV.14, 47 However, it is not clear in the latter study whether the source pigs were PCV positive. The issue of potential cross species transmission received attention after DNA from PCV1 was reported in rotavirus vaccines prepared independently by two pharmaceutical companies: in one of these, DNA from PCV2 was also detected. After consideration of this finding, regulatory authorities in Europe48 and USA49 concluded that due to minimal risk of zoonotic potential, this DNA presence does not pose a safety concern and that there is no need to restrict the use of these vaccines.",

PCV viremia was also checked at this timepoint by PCR testing. PCV viremia monitoring via PCR was then performed repeatedly during the gestation period. If a sow exhibited antibody titers to PPV or Leptospirosis or was viremic for PCV at any point during gestation, the sow was excluded. Once initiated, the PCV vaccination program greatly reduced the level of PCV viremia in the multiplier unit, increasing the available number of suitable sows for SAF population.

These outbreaks were not expected as the CDCD piglets upon release at three weeks of age from quarantine nursery were in all cases free of all DPF listed agents of exclusion. Both PCV outbreaks first occurred after piglets were moved into animal holding rooms. In the first outbreak, it was found that the means of transmission was via the stainless steel penning in animal holding rooms; the second via employee facilitated contamination from a PCV high risk area, the external C\u2010section suite located adjacent to the SAF, which was then transferred by the employee's entry into the barrier and direct contact with PCV\u2010negative, na\u00efve pigs.

Apparently, in some rooms, the penning was then insufficiently degreased before disinfection, and intact PCV virus was thereby protected by the grease on the stainless steel allowing survival during disinfection using aqueous media. The ensuing physical contact of the piglets and the greasy penning likely then liberated the PCV and initiated the outbreak.

Therefore, essentially during the phase of populating the DPF barrier, the herd in the multiplier unit was in a first phase of viral contact, active viremia, and seroconversion. Since the start of operations at the multiplier unit in 2005, we had not observed any animal showing PCVAD. Initially,we took no special precautions at the time to specifically prevent PCV entry into the barrier, but were successful in the case of cohort #1. After the first PCV outbreak, PCV\u2010specific preventive measures were taken including testing of sows for PCV viremia at breeding and during pregnancy. Once a vaccine became available, starting with cohort #4, we initiated vaccination of sows used for producing founder animals before and during pregnancy. It is not clear whether vaccination was necessary, but the outcome was successful as none of the piglets delivered to the barrier facility were PCV positive immediately following introduction. Exacerbating the uncertainty of whether vaccination was a necessity are the facts that PCV vaccines are typically developed for first administration at an early life stage,21, 33 and that vaccination of pregnant sows does not completely prevent infection of piglets via the transplacental route.34 However, the exclusion of sows exhibiting PCV viremia during pregnancy is supported by the fact that transplacental infection of fetuses is quite likely in such animals.29, 30\n",
