However, since the introduction of steroids for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, investigators have become aware of injurious effects [2, 3]. There is an abundance of literature documenting steroid-related osteonecrosis [4, 5], and a causal relationship has been well established. Steroid use has become the most common non-traumatic cause of osteonecrosis, with a prevalence ranging from 3 to 38% [6].",

            "text": "The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 caused approximately 8098 people to be infected with SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [7]. The SARS-CoV was a novel virus that human beings were encountering for the first time, and they had no effective antiviral agents for treatment. High-dose steroid treatment was frequently prescribed in severe cases to reduce immune activities and other symptoms [7, 8]. The wide use of steroids resulted in the development of serious side effects in many recovered SARS patients, including osteonecrosis [9, 10]. However, the relationship between steroid therapy and osteonecrosis remains unclear, partly because although a number of studies had reported the prevalence of steroid-related osteonecrosis in recovered patients [11\u201323], some of them failed to address the regimens used [21\u201323]. The absence of information regarding steroid administration regimens prevented researchers from making precise evaluations of this link. Additionally, Felson and colleagues [24] reported that there was a dose-response relationship between steroid use and the incidence of osteonecrosis. However, whether there is a similar dose-response relationship in SARS patients who received steroids remains unknown. Furthermore, we wondered if there were sex differences in the development of steroid-related osteonecrosis in SARS patients. Therefore, in the current meta-analysis, we aimed to examine the effects of steroid therapy on osteonecrosis in recovered SARS patients. The sex differences in the development of steroid-induced osteonecrosis were also examined.",
