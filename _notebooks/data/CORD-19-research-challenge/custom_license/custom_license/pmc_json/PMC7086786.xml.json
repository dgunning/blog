Since many of these respiratory viruses co-circulate around the same time, often in winter, there is an increasing possibility that dual or multiple viruses coinfect a single host [1]. Indeed, incidents of coinfection with multiple viruses were detected using multi-target analysis such as multiplex PCR or next-generation sequencing [2\u20137]. Several studies indicate that coinfection is not associated with disease outcome [5, 8\u201310], while others indicate increase of disease severity [11\u201313]. Thus, pathological relevance of coinfection is unclear.",

In this context, it seems that growth of one virus affects that of other viruses in any way. Although virus\u2013virus interactions have been recognized in vivo level [14\u201316], little has been reported on in vitro interactions of coinfected viruses. It has been assumed that single viruses cause virus-mediated respiratory diseases. Biological analysis of viral pathogens in the laboratory is almost always conducted in the absence of other viruses.

            "text": "Influenza A virus (IAV) and human parainfluenza virus type 2 (hPIV2) are common pathogens that cause community-acquired respiratory disease in the same epidemic season, usually in winter. Both of these negative-stranded RNA viruses utilize sialic acids on the cell surface as a receptor, allowing them to target same cells. However, their biological properties are quite different. The IAV genome consists of eight segments that replicate in the nucleus. In contrast, hPIV2 has a non-segmented genome, and its replication is primarily in the cytoplasm. Both viruses carry a system to evade host antiviral responses. The non-structural (NS1) protein of IAV has been reported to limit interferon (IFN) production by blocking the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)/interferon-beta promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1) signaling pathway [17]. Also it blocks the function of IFN-induced proteins, such as 2\u2032\u20135\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase and the dsRNA-dependent serine/threonine protein kinase R [18\u201321]. The counterpart of hPIV2 is the V protein. The V protein inhibits IFN production by binding to RIG-I like receptors, the melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) [22, 23]. The V protein also acts as an alternative substrate for inhibitor of kappa B kinase epsilon and TRAF family member-associated NF-kappa-B activator binding kinase 1 leading to inhibition of the interferon regulatory transcription factor (IRF) 3 activation [24]. The V protein also inhibits Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7- and TLR 9-dependent signaling by interaction with the IRF 7 and the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) [25]. In addition, the V protein suppresses expression of the interferon inducible genes by degradation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) protein [26\u201329].",

We found that the growth of IAV was enhanced by coinfection with hPIV2, but not vice versa. Further experiments revealed that the enhanced growth of IAV was attributed to generation of syncytia of IAV-infected cells induced by hPIV2 coinfection. We also confirmed that IAV growth was slightly increased by hPIV2-induced cell fusion in cells from the respiratory epithelium. These results suggest that viral propagation by coinfection with different viruses can modify their pathological consequences.",

The IAV-infected cells were found sporadically at 48 h after infection, which look like single IAV infection (Fig. 2a, panel k and b, panel d). The growth kinetics of H-83/186-mutant virus was almost identical with that of wt hPIV2 (data not shown). The growth rate of IAV in coinfection with wt hPIV2 from 24 to 48 h after infection resulted in about a threefold increase over that of a single IAV infection. In contrast, the growth rate of IAV was not increased by coinfection with the H-83/186-mutant virus and was identical with that of a single IAV infection (Fig. 2c). These results suggested that the enhanced propagation of IAV in hPIV2 coinfection was due to the generation of syncytia that incorporated IAV-infected cells.",

Since some of the targets of V protein are involved in an IFN-independent innate antiviral response [38\u201342], V may have some relevance to accelerated replication of IAV irrespective of inhibition of type I IFN expression. To test this possibility, we established Vero cells constitutively expressing the hPIV2 V protein (Vero-V) using the episomal Epstein\u2013Barr virus-based expression system (Fig. 3a). Since pEBS-V was maintained in transfected cells as an episome, we eliminated untransfected cells using hygromycin B, and resistant cells were pooled as Vero-V cells. Vero-E control cells were generated by introduction of an empty plasmid. IFA of the Vero-V cells showed that, except for a small population, the majority of cells expressed the V protein, which localized predominantly in the nuclei as reported previously (Fig. 3a) [26, 43]. The functionality of expressed V protein was confirmed by STAT2 degradation in the Vero-V cells (Fig. 3b). The growth property of IAV was studied in three pools of Vero-V and Vero-E cells, which were established by independent transfections. V protein expression did not enhance the propagation of IAV in the three experiments (Fig. 3c), suggesting that V was not involved in the enhanced propagation of IAV during coinfection with hPIV2.\n",

Cell fusion by hPIV2 infection at an MOI of 0.05 was observed in H358 cells but not in A549 cells (Fig. 5, panels d, k). The cell fusion activity of hPIV2 in H358 cells was apparently weak in comparison with that in Vero cells (Figs. 2a, panel e, 5, panel k). To maximize cell fusion effect in IAV production, we infected IAV at an MOI of 1 and incubated the infected cell without trypsin. Coinfection of hPIV2 decreased IAV production in A549 cells, but did not decrease in H358 cell (Table 1), indicating that coinfection with wt hPIV2 tended to support IAV production in H358 cells. To confirm the IAV productivity by hPIV2 coinfection was relevant to cell fusion, the reduced fusogenic-mutant virus, H-83/186, was used for coinfection with IAV as shown in Fig. 2b. Coinfection of the H-83/186 hPIV2 mutant had no effect on IAV production in H358 cells (Table 1, H358, H-83/186 hPIV2 mutant).\n\n",

Second, ammonium chloride, which suppresses influenza virus entering the cytoplasm by inhibition of endosomal acidification [46\u201348], was added to culture medium at 3 h after infection. Neither treatment affected cell fusion and virus growth by hPIV2 infection (Fig. 6a, b).

IAV growth reached a plateau at 48 h after infection in Vero cells (Fig. 1b), as the number of infected cells increased very little from 48 to 72 h after infection even though uninfected cells still existed (Fig. 2a, panels k, l). The inefficient spread of IAV in Vero cells limits the growth of IAV. When IAV was coinfected with hPIV2, hPIV2 induced extensive syncytia which incorporated the IAV-infected cells (Fig. 2a). Our results indicate that IAV could expand the infection due to cell fusion independently of infection by progeny viruses. It seems that formation of the IAV-infected syncytia overcame inefficient spread of IAV in Vero cells. This conclusion is supported by the fact that coinfection with the limited fusogenic H-83/186 hPIV2-mutant virus did not enhance the IAV growth (Fig. 2b) and that induction of cell fusion by the HN and F expression increased IAV production (Fig. 4b).",

As A549 and H358 cells are carcinoma cell lines originated from human respiratory epithelium and frequently used as in vitro model of the respiratory infection for IAV, we used these cells for coinfection experiments. Coinfection of hPIV2 resulted in limited cell fusion in H358 cells and IAV production was increased slightly. IAV cannot undergo multiple rounds of infection in cells incubated without trypsin. The slight increase in IAV production is presumably due to cell fusion induced by hPIV2. Indeed, the propagation of IAV was not impacted in A549 cells coinfected with wt hPIV2 and H358 cells coinfected with H-83/136 hPIV2-mutant virus, both of which lacked cell fusion. Thus, these results also support a hypothesis that IAV production correlates with cell fusion induced by hPIV2.

Therefore, the cytopathogenicity of IAV is predicted as a major cause of growth suppression of RSV. In contrast, it seems that hPIV2 replication was not suppressed because IAV infection showed little cytopathic effect in Vero cells (Fig. 2a). This prediction is supported by our preliminary experiment, in which growth of hPIV2 with IAV coinfection was reduced to 1/10\u20131/30 of that of hPIV2 infection alone in MDCK cells (data not shown).",

Although almost all the targets of the V protein are key molecules in type I IFN induction or IFN signaling, some of the targets are capable of inducing innate antiviral response independent of IFN [38\u201342]. These findings raise the possibility that the V protein counteracts the cellular antiviral system even in type I IFN gene-deficient Vero cells [50]. Thus, we examined whether the V protein of hPIV2 had an impact on intracellular replication of IAV in IAV and hPIV2-coinfected Vero cells. We established Vero cells constitutively expressing the hPIV2 V protein and showed that the localization of the V protein was predominantly intranuclear in Vero-V cells (Fig. 3a). Our results indicated that the expression of V protein alone did not enhance IAV growth, suggesting that the antiviral factors are unlikely to be involved in IAV replication. In addition, the intranuclear V protein conceivably has no effect on IAV genome replication. Although the functionality of the expressed V protein was confirmed by degradation of STAT2 protein, these results may be misleading. Our results agreed with the previous report indicating intranuclear localization of the V protein in the V protein-expressing cells [26, 43]. The V protein, however, exhibited not only intranuclear distribution but also distribution throughout the cytoplasm in hPIV2-infected cells [51]. Thus, the V protein in Vero-V cells may not be functionally equivalent to that in hPIV2-infected cells. Indeed, V protein expression in our cells does not complement impaired replication of a mutant hPIV2 due to amino acid substitutions in the V protein [52]. Accordingly, there is still a possibility that the V protein supports the enhanced IAV growth in coinfected cells.",

To acquire infectivity of IAVs, the HA protein must be activated by trypsin cleavage at a specific site. Ammonium chloride inhibits acidification of endosomes where a low-pH-dependent conformational change in the HA protein triggers fusion of the virus envelope with the endosomal membrane [46]. Thus, in either condition multiple rounds of IAV replication are suppressed. We found that the titer of IAV decreased after 48 h after infection in the case of single infection (Fig. 5c). However, IAV continued to grow under these conditions when hPIV2 was coinfected. The distinct growth of IAV is presumed to be largely attributable to cell fusion induced by hPIV2. As discussed above IAV could expand the extent of infection by the cell fusion independently of infection by progeny viruses. Therefore, syncytium formation could confer expanded region of virus production to IAV regardless of culture condition. From this perspective, viruses with the ability to induce syncytium formation, such as RSV and mumps virus, may support IAV propagation as seen in this study.",
