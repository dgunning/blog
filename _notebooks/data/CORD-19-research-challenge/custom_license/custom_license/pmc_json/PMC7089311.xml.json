            "text": "This collection of papers results from the 12th International Conference on Invertebrate and Fish Cell Culture, which took place concurrently with the 2008 World Congress on In Vitro Biology in Tucson, Arizona from June 14 to 18, 2008. The World Congress drew a total of 251 abstracts, including 54 oral presentations as well as numerous poster presentations. Attendees (342 in total) included many undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral associates, and junior and senior scientists, encouraging interaction at all levels. As part of this stimulating atmosphere, the 12th International Conference on Invertebrate and Fish Cell Culture offered six oral presentations covering two topics: \u201cCell Interactions and Signal Mechanisms\u201d and \u201cFish and Amphibian Cells in Ecotoxicological Research\u201d. Additionally, a round-table discussion encouraging lively discussion on the state of our field was also convened. Lastly, a joint session with the SIVB Animal Section included three presentations on \u201cVirus-Cell Interactions in Vertebrate and Invertebrate Systems\u201d.",
