In contrast, inhibitors of translation including EIF2AK2 (which encodes PKR) were upregulated. PKR phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2a) to cause the arrest of translation initiation [11], suggesting that protein synthesis in H1N1/09 patients may be impaired by repressed transcription of genes required for the translation apparatus, and by increased transcription of translation inhibitors. Reduced expression of protein synthesis genes was significant between H1N1/09 and controls (P = 7.9 \u00d7 10\u221226) and also between H1N1/09 and RSV or bacterial infection (P = 2.73 \u00d7 10\u221213 and 1.6 \u00d7 10\u221211, respectively; Figure 2). In an influenza A challenge study of adult volunteers, differential expression of translation initiation pathway genes was identified in symptomatic but not subclinical infections [12], supporting a role for altered protein synthesis as a key component of the host response to H1N1/09 infection.",

Influenza virus has been observed to shut-off protein synthesis and decrease mRNA levels in infected cells [13], but the phenomenon we have observed in peripheral blood suggests a widespread alteration affecting cells distant from the site of infection. We hypothesize that suppression of protein synthesis may be a distinctive feature of H1N1/09 infection and may play a role in the prolonged debility, fatigue, and delayed recovery seen in severely affected patients. Many of the fatal H1N1/09 cases had acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring prolonged ventilation [1], and late pulmonary hemorrhage or persistent respiratory failure, with death weeks after the acute illness. Suppressed protein synthesis might result in poor tissue recovery and may provide an explanation for the prolonged illness and poor outcome in some patients.",
