            "text": "Inflammation within the CNS is a common feature of neurological disorders and infection, but whether it contributes directly to neuronal or glial damage in vivo can be difficult to determine. For example, in a disease such as multiple sclerosis, and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), immune-mediated inflammation can be prominent but it is difficult to disentangle the indirect consequences of the inflammation from other ongoing immune-mediated disease processes. Experimentally, inflammation can be induced in most tissues by the local injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and typically large numbers of neutrophils and monocytes invade the tissue from the bloodstream within minutes, macrophages remaining at the site for a number of days (Issekutz et al., 1981; Cybulsky et al., 1988). However, LPS injection into the parenchyma of the adult brain results in an altered and attenuated cellular response. Thus, a quantity of LPS which elicits a typical inflammatory response in the skin (20 ng) does not result in the recruitment of either neutrophils or monocytes when examined 1\u201310 days after injection into the hippocampus (Andersson et al., 1992a). Cellular influx is attenuated despite the fact that 20\u201350 ng of LPS is effective in rapidly up-regulating the expression of endothelial intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell-adhesion molecule (VCAM) (Bell and Perry, 1995), and of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1; Stern et al., 2000). Increasing the quantity of LPS injected to 200\u20131000 ng, which results in a florid extravasation of neutrophils in the skin, still does not result in significant neutrophil recruitment in the brain parenchyma, although it does cause activation of microglia and recruitment of monocytes (Andersson et al., 1992a; Montero-Menei et al., 1994).",

            "text": "Studies of the consequences of LPS-induced inflammation in the brain have so far tended to focus on relatively acute effects, and they have not used high-resolution histological techniques to assess changes in tissue architecture. Moreover, studies have so far neglected the injection of LPS into the spinal cord despite the observation that the inflammatory response can differ between the brain and the spinal cord following traumatic lesions (Schnell et al., 1999). We have therefore examined in detail the short- and long-term consequences of injecting LPS into spinal white matter. Our study used light and electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry to examine tissue up to 28 days after injection in order to determine the time course of cellular recruitment, and changes in local tissue structure. We report that, following the recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages, a large primary demyelinating lesion formed in the dorsal funiculus after a delay of up to 1 week following injection. It is possible that the inflammation-associated demyelination observed in this study may illuminate the mechanisms underlying the inflammation-associated demyelination in multiple sclerosis, particularly in pattern III lesions.",

Characteristically, the breakdown of the myelin sheath appeared to progress from the adaxonal region outwards, or from the cytoplasmic regions of Schmidt\u2013Lanterman incisures or paranodal regions. The myelin breakdown appeared in transverse section to progress from a small vesicular appearance to a larger disorganized mesh of membrane (Fig. 3C\u2013E). In more oblique sections the small vesicles were seen as tubes, an appearance reminiscent of that seen in the early stages of lysophosphatidylcholine-induced demyelination (Hall and Gregson, 1971). The demyelination in most instances appeared to be taking place without the close apposition of a myelomonocytic cell, and apoptotic cells were seen; however, because of the dissolution of nuclear and cytoplasmic components it was difficult to identify such cells on morphological criteria. Many phagocytic cells containing myelin debris were seen, but the extracellular space also contained considerable amounts of membranous myelin debris. Despite the prominence of the demyelination, axon loss, as indicated by the number of fibres undergoing Wallerian degeneration, was small, in both the sensory, ascending, portion of the dorsal column 4 mm rostral to the lesion (Fig. 5A) and in the descending corticospinal tract 4 mm caudal to the lesion (Fig. 5B). \n",

This increased labelling in the adjacent grey matter persisted at 14 days, and at this time nearly the entire lesioned area was a fine meshwork of moderately GFAP-immunoreactive processes, with occasional thicker, more intensely labelled processes present. The entire lesioned area remained moderately GFAP-positive 28 days after LPS injection, at this time exhibiting a cobbled appearance. The occasional intensely labelled processes present appeared to be confined to the periphery of the lesion. This lesion remyelinates predominately by Schwann cells, which, prior to myelination, can express GFAP (Jessen et al., 1990). Thus, it seems likely that the moderate labelling present across the lesion at 14 and 28 days represents labelling of GFAP within Schwann cells prior to or immediately after myelination. Any disappearance of astrocytes from this Schwann cell territory would be predicted from previous studies of regions of Schwann cell remyelination in the CNS (Blakemore, 1975; Felts and Smith, 1996). \n",

Both populations were present in relatively small numbers; the former was observed up to 3 days after injection, and the second up to 7 days after injection, when only a few labelled cells were present. Since a variety of cells likely to be present in the LPS lesion have been reported to up-regulate expression of ICAM-1 in response to inflammatory mediators, including microglia (Zielasek et al., 1993), macrophages (Goebeler et al., 1993), astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (Satoh et al., 1991), it is likely that several cell types contributed to the observed ICAM-1 labelling.",

Typically, an inflammatory reaction is evoked in the CNS, but it is substantially muted when compared with similar injections in other tissues (Andersson et al., 1992a). In general, little or no demyelination has been reported, although demyelination was not specifically examined in most of the studies. In two studies where myelin was examined, some limited myelin loss was reported. Matyszak and Perry (1995) found that the injection of killed bacillus Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) directly into the hippocampus produced an acute inflammatory response but did not result in myelin loss. However, when animals were subsequently given BCG peripherally, a delayed-type hypersensitivity developed which was associated with myelin loss, as assessed by immunohistochemistry. In a subsequent study (Matyszak et al., 1997) it was demonstrated that, at least in small pockets, this myelin loss resulted from primary demyelination. Lehnardt and colleagues found a reduction in immunolabelling with the oligodendrocyte marker RIP following large doses of LPS (5 \u00b5g) injected into the pericallosal white matter of neonatal rats (Lehnardt et al., 2002). However, such doses of LPS produced destructive, cystic lesions in many animals, and so although the nature of the myelin loss was not examined in detail, it seems likely to have been secondary to axonal degeneration. In summary, the present study is the first report of substantial primary demyelination resulting directly from the injection of an inflammogen into the CNS.",

First, using an erythrocyte lysis assay we found no evidence of membrane damage.

            "text": "It is possible that LPS may be directly toxic to oligodendrocytes, perhaps acting via plasmalemmal receptors. Such direct cell damage is suggested by studies demonstrating a detrimental effect of LPS on the survival of oligodendrocyte progenitors in vitro (Molina-Holgado et al., 2001). However, mRNA for LPS receptors is either absent [Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)] or found only at very low levels (CD14) in oligodendrocyte precursors (Lehnardt et al., 2002). On the other hand, many commercial preparations of LPS have been shown to contain contaminants that are highly bioactive, and can activate receptors other than TLR4, including Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) (Hirschfeld et al., 2000), a receptor that has been reported to be expressed by oligodendrocytes (Bsibsi et al., 2002). This contamination is perhaps best illustrated by the ability of these preparations to activate leucocytes from C3H/HeJ mice, which lack functional TLR4 (Morrison et al., 1976). To examine the possibility that our typical LPS preparation was indeed acting via other receptors, we also examined the effect of an LPS preparation that does not activate cells from C3H/HeJ mice. The lesions resulting from such injections (Fig. 11) appeared similar to those produced by the less pure LPS preparation, indicating that the lesions are the result of the LPS, as expected, and probably mediated by TLR4 activation. Thus, if TLR4 is absent in adult oligodendrocytes they would be unlikely to respond directly to LPS since this receptor is thought to play a key role in signal transduction following LPS binding (Poltorak et al., 1998; Hoshino et al., 1999). These considerations suggest that LPS may be acting via other, indirect, mechanisms.",

            "text": "The apparent conflict between the findings of Molina-Holgado et al. (2001), indicating that oligodendrocyte progenitors are sensitive to LPS, and the seeming absence of appropriate receptors, as demonstrated by Lehnardt et al. (2002), is probably due to the degree of cellular purity of the examined cultures. Lehnardt and colleagues found that the deleterious effect of LPS on oligodendrocyte progenitors was dependent on the presence of microglia (Lehnardt et al., 2002), and a role for these cells is also supported by the observation that conditioned media from LPS-exposed microglia (or astrocytes) injured oligodendrocyte progenitors (Pang et al., 2000). The factor(s) responsible are not clear, but a role for TNF-\u03b1 is possible since this cytokine has been shown to damage rodent (Selmaj and Raine, 1988; Cammer, 2002) and human (Jurewicz et al., 2003) oligodendrocytes in vitro. However, injection of TNF-\u03b1 into white matter in vivo does not result in demyelination (Hall et al., 2000), and so if this agent is involved it may act in concert with other factors; or perhaps demyelination can result from chronic, rather than acute, exposure to TNF-\u03b1. Recent evidence suggests that peroxynitrite (formed from nitric oxide and superoxide anion) plays a key role in LPS-induced, microglial-mediated oligodendrocyte damage in vitro (Li et al., 2004). Thus, although LPS might not be directly toxic to oligodendrocytes, it could cause demyelination indirectly via factors derived from activated microglia, astrocytes or macrophages. Arguing against this possibility is the fact that dexamethasone treatment reduced the inflammatory response, as indicated by the reduction in cells expressing iNOS, yet demyelination was at least as extensive as that seen in control animals. Dexamethasone is known to inhibit the LPS-induced activation of the transcription factors nuclear factor-\u03baB and activated protein-1 in monocytic cells, leading to decreased production of inflammatory mediators such as IL-1\u03b2 (Jeon et al., 2000). There are several possible explanations for why dexamethasone did not reduce the extent of demyelination. First, the dexamethasone treatment may not have adequately suppressed the inflammation. This may be the case, since iNOS activity was suppressed, but not eliminated, in the lesion. Secondly, the cellular actions of both LPS and dexamethasone are complex, and activation of cells by LPS via pathways unaffected by dexamethasone may also have occurred, perhaps via the MyD88-independent cascade following TLR4 activation (for review see Akira and Takeda, 2004). Certainly, dexamethasone has recently been shown actually to enhance expression of tissue factor (Reddy et al., 2004), a transmembrane glycoprotein present on monocytic cells which activates coagulation cascades. Local activation of tissue factor might have resulted in ischaemia, thereby augmenting the lesions. In summary, although the mechanism of LPS-induced demyelination is not known, we favour the idea that oligodendrocytes are killed by a factor or factors produced by activated inflammatory cells, particularly in the light of the finding that LPS-activated microglia are capable of inducing oligodendrocyte damage in culture (Lehnardt et al., 2002).",

            "text": "Could the current observations on LPS-induced demyelination illuminate the mechanisms involved in the demyelination observed in inflammatory demyelinating disease? CNS demyelination occurs in association with inflammation in a number of disorders, including multiple sclerosis (Lassmann, 1999), Devic's neuromyelitis optica (Baudoin et al., 1998), recurrent transverse myelitis (Pandit and Rao, 1996), HTLV-1 associated tropical spastic paraparesis (Ijichi et al., 1996) and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (Stuve and Zamvil, 1999), including the form of the latter disorder which is associated with infection with the Gram-negative bacterium Chlamydia pneumoniae (Heick and Skriver, 2000). However, our understanding of the mechanism of demyelination in such disorders is often incomplete. It is possible that the mechanism involved in one or more of these disorders may be common to that operating in the current experimental lesion; if so, the current lesion could act as a useful model with which to explore the mechanism for potential therapeutic targets. We note in particular that in the current lesion MAG is lost before other myelin proteins, and this loss appears to occur just prior to the initiation of demyelination. Such preferential loss of MAG also occurs in some inflammatory demyelinating lesions in multiple sclerosis, designated \u2018pattern III\u2019 by Lucchinetti and colleagues (Lucchinetti et al., 2000; Aboul-Enein et al., 2003). The unusual initiation of demyelination in the periaxonal myelin may be another manifestation of this early MAG loss, as MAG is normally found in the periaxonal myelin in the CNS (Trapp et al., 1989). This pattern of demyelination is not reproduced by the usual experimental model for multiple sclerosis, namely EAE (Lucchinetti et al., 2000). It is notable that in both multiple sclerosis (H. Lassmann, personal communication) and the current LPS model this unusual pattern of demyelination occurs in conjunction with microglial activation and the prominent expression of iNOS. The current findings suggest that LPS-induced demyelination might be a useful experimental model for demyelinating lesions exhibiting the pattern III phenotype.",
