The major structural component of the virion is the N protein, and it binds to genomic and antigenomic RNAs along their entire length and forms ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. These complexes serve as templates for viral RNA replication and transcription [18, 34]. The N protein has been shown to interact with viral RdRP and display RNA chaperone activity [3, 25]. In addition, it also can replace the cellular eIF4F complex, thereby ensuring efficient translation of viral mRNA [26].

It binds to single-stranded RNA in a non-sequence-specific manner, but not to double-stranded RNA [34]. However, compared to the N protein of hantaviruses, the TSWV N protein is much smaller, and the RNA-binding domain has not been clearly defined. It has been shown to interact homotypically in vitro and in vivo [37, 38, 42]. The TSWV N protein exists as multimers or aggregates of increasing molecular mass. Analysis of deletion and site-specific mutants of TSWV N protein has revealed that the subunits can interact in a head-to-tail manner, and two conserved phenylalanine residues (F242 and F246) are crucial for this interaction [42]. Apart from its homotypic interaction, the TSWV N protein is known to interact with viral glycoproteins and is proposed to be involved in viral particle assembly in the Golgi [33]. It also interacts with NSm and aids in the cell-to-cell movement of RNP complexes [39]. The three-dimensional structure of the N protein has not been described so far for any member of the genus Tospovirus.",

The complete genomic sequence of GBNV L, M, and S RNA was determined earlier [9, 35, 36]. With a view to understanding the virus life cycle at the molecular level, a strain of GBNV infecting tomato in Karnataka state in India, GBNV- To (K), was purified and characterized. The N gene of GBNV was cloned, overexpressed and purified. The purified recombinant N protein was used for the generation of monoclonal antibodies [15]. Recently, the NSs protein of this virus was characterized and shown to possess ATPase and 5\u2032 phosphatase activities [23]. The N protein of GBNV shares only 29% amino acid identity with that of TSWV [35], the type member of the genus, and therefore, there is an obvious need for specific characterization of the GBNV N protein.",

Of the different E.coli host strains (BL21(DE3) pLysS, Rosetta, C43(DE3)) tested for expression, BL21(DE3) pLysS cells gave the highest levels of protein expression with all of the constructs, and therefore, this strain was chosen to express the full-length GBNV N protein and its truncated forms.

In order to investigate the oligomeric state of the N protein, size-exclusion chromatography was carried out on a Superdex S-200 column as described in \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d. The protein eluted in three peaks (Fig. 3d). Peak 1 corresponded to the void fraction (greater than 600 kDa), peak 2 corresponded to 128 kDa (tetramer), and peak 3 corresponded to a 32-kDa (monomer) protein, as estimated using proteins of known molecular mass prior to loading the sample. There was an additional broad peak that eluted late in the run and had a high absorbance at 260 nm. However, when this fraction was analysed by western blot analysis, it did not show the presence of an N-protein-specific band. These results suggest that the purified N protein existed as a heterogeneous mixture of monomers, tetramers and higher-order oligomers. Furthermore, the absorbance at 260 nm was higher than that at 280 nm, indicating that the N protein might be associated with nucleic acids. To confirm the presence of nucleic acid, the protein was further analysed on a 0.6% agarose gel. Agarose gel analysis showed two bands, one at the well and another that entered the gel (Fig. 4a). Both of the bands showed ethidium bromide staining and Coomassie blue staining, confirming that N protein is associated with nucleic acids (Fig. 4a). The bound nucleic acid was degraded specifically by RNase A treatment (Supplementary Fig. 1), suggesting that the N protein is present in a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. Such an association of N protein with RNA has also been reported for Bunyamvera virus [27] and Rift Valley fever virus [32]. Several attempts were made to purify N protein devoid of nucleic acid by using various salts, detergents and nucleases in the buffers throughout the purification steps.

Full-length N protein contained 19.5 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcg of RNA in 100 \u03bcg of the protein, whereas the amount of RNA present was reduced by approximately 3-fold upon deletion of 20 amino acids from the N-terminus or 15 amino acids from the C-terminus. When 40 amino acid residues from the N terminus were removed, the amount of RNA associated with the protein was reduced by approximately 6-fold. As expected, no RNA was detected with the C\u220637 N protein. Thus, the capacity of the N protein to bind nucleic acid was completely lost upon removal of the unfolded region of the N protein comprising 37 residues from the C-terminus. This suggested that the C-terminal unfolded region (which also contains 46% of the residues predicted to interact with RNA) might play a major role in RNA binding. The location of an RNA-binding domain in the N proteins of negative-strand RNA viruses is variable. Xu et al. [44] mapped a specific RNA-binding domain to a central conserved region comprising residues 175 to 217 of the hantavirus N protein. Multiple regions of RNA binding have been observed for the TSWV N protein [34] and for the influenza virus N protein [7]. It may be noted that even in GBNV, apart from the C-terminal region, the deletion of the N-terminal 40 amino acid residues also affected the protein-nucleic acid interaction. It is possible that the loss of protein-nucleic acid interaction in this mutant is because of the altered structure of the mutant protein. Involvement of disordered regions in RNA binding has also been reported for the N protein of SARS corona virus, a positive-strand RNA virus [4]. Bioinformatic analysis shows that the C-terminal unfolded region is conserved across N proteins of serogroup IV tospoviruses and might be involved in genome encapsidation.\n",

The majority of the RNAs migrated within the 50-80-nucleotide size range and some RNA species migrated at around 80-150 nucleotides (Fig. 4b). Taking into account that the majority of the N protein exists as a tetramer (Fig. 3d), and taking the average length of the RNA species as 50 nucleotides, 12-13 nucleotides might bind per N monomer. N/RNA stoichiometry has been shown to vary between 6 and 24 nt in negative-strand RNA viruses [2, 10, 27, 43]. Studies carried out by Mohl and Barr [27] with Bunyamwera virus have shown that there is no obligatory requirement of a specific sequence or structure for RNA encapsidation.",

In vitro phosphorylation of the purified N protein was carried out as described in \"Materials and methods\". As shown in Fig. 5a, lane 1, the N protein was phosphorylated by the kinase(s) present in the soluble fraction of N. benthamiana plant sap. Two negative controls were run in every experiment. In one of these, \u03b332P ATP was added to the purified N protein in the absence of plant sap, which did not result in labeling of the N protein (Fig. 5a, lane 2), suggesting that the N protein by itself does not bind to radiolabeled ATP. In the other control, the plant sap alone was incubated with \u03b332P ATP, and no specific bands were observed, suggesting that none of the host proteins present in the sap were phosphorylated (Fig. 5a, lane 3). The gel was stained with Coomassie blue to estimate the amount of protein loaded and the molecular mass of the protein (Fig. 5a, lane 4).\n",

            "text": "The phosphorylation reaction was inhibited to some extent by the addition of metal chelators such as EGTA (2 mM) and EDTA (2 mM) (Fig. 5a, lanes 5 and 6, respectively), suggesting a requirement for divalent metal ions for the reaction. Furthermore, when the reaction was carried out in the absence of MnCl2, the phosphorylation was abolished, confirming the requirement for metal ions (Fig. 5b, lane 1). Therefore, the specificity of the metal ion required for the phosphorylation of the N protein was tested by the addition of increasing concentrations of MnCl2 (Fig. 5b, lanes 2-4), MgCl2 (Fig. 5b, lanes 5-7), and CaCl2 (Fig. 5b, lanes 8-10). As is apparent from the figure, the plant protein kinase that phosphorylates the N protein shows a preference for Mn2+ over Mg2+, and no detectable band could be seen with Ca2+. The Coomassie-stained gel confirmed that the effect observed was not due to variation in the amount of N protein used in the reaction. Similar observations have been made for a plant protein kinase that phosphorylates PVA coat protein and TMV movement protein [16]. Protein kinases that belong to the CK2 class have a unique ability to utilize both ATP and GTP as phosphoryl group donors [28]. The soluble fraction of N. benthamiana plant sap that was used for phosphorylation of the N protein was tested for its ability to utilize GTP instead of ATP. As shown in Fig. 5c, the protein kinase present in the fraction could utilize GTP as phoshphoryl group donor equally well (Fig. 5c, lane 4), and even in this case, Mn2+ was the preferred metal ion (Fig. 5c, compare lane 4 with 5 and 6). Based on these data, we speculated that the protein kinase present in tobacco plant sap that phosphorylates the N protein could be a CK2-like kinase. Heparin, an inhibitor of CK2 [14], reduced the phosphorylation of the N protein by 30% but failed to abolish phosphorylation of the protein completely (Supplementary Fig. 3), suggesting that apart from CK2, there may be other kinases present in the tobacco plant sap that also phosphorylate the protein. To test whether the N protein acts as a substrate for more than one kinase, the phosphorylation reaction was carried out with purified recombinant kinases, viz., tobacco CK2 or chickpea CDPK. It was observed that the N protein could be phosphorylated by both of these kinases. As shown in Fig. 5d, the N protein could be phosphorylated by purified CK2 (Fig. 5d, lane 3), whereas BSA used as negative control was not phosphorylated (Fig. 5d, lane 5), and histone H1 (positive control) was phosphorylated (Fig. 5d, lane 6). In addition to the phosphorylated histone H1 protein (35 kDa), two more bands were observed, suggesting the presence of contaminant proteins that are also phosphorylated. When a similar experiment was performed with purified CDPK, the N protein as well as the histone H1 protein were phosphorylated (Fig. 5e, lanes 3 and 5, respectively) and BSA used as a negative control was not phosphorylated (Fig. 5e, lane 6). It has been demonstrated that CDPKs are components of the defence pathways that are induced upon pathogen attack [22]. It is possible that phosphorylation of the N protein by CDPK is an early response to viral infection. Furthermore, the N protein can be phosphorylated by more than one kinase. Phosphorylation of a viral protein by multiple kinases is not uncommon. Surjit et al. [41] reported that the nucleocapsid protein of SARS corona virus acts as a substrate for cyclin-dependent kinase, glycogen synthase kinase, mitogen-activated kinase and casein kinase 2. Human influenza virus NS1 protein gets phosphorylated by members of the cyclin-dependent kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase families [13].",

            "text": "Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is a significant regulatory mechanism in a wide range of cellular processes (reviewed in ref. [6]). In some viruses, like rubella virus and potato virus A, phosphorylation of the capsid or coat protein is known to regulate its RNA-binding activity and has an impact on virus replication and the infection process [16, 17, 21]. Phosphorylation of SARS coronavirus N protein modulates its multimerization, translation inhibitory activity and subcellular localization [31, 41]. In infectious bronchitis virus, phosphorylation of the N protein is involved in distinguishing viral RNA from non viral RNAs [40]. In yet another case, in measles virus, phosphorylation of the nucleoprotein is important for activation of transcription of viral mRNA and/or replication of the genome in vivo [12]. It is possible that phosphorylation of the GBNV N protein regulates its self-association and helps it to distinguish viral RNA from non-viral RNAs, which is an essential process in encapsidation. Phosphorylation may also regulate the subcellular localization of the protein and may act as a regulatory switch between the processes of transcription and translation.",

Such an association with RNA would be essential for encapsidation of viral genomes. Furthermore, the N protein interacts with the RNA via a conserved RNA-binding domain present in the C-terminal unfolded region of the protein. Such specific interactions and the regulation of the N protein by phosphorylation would be necessary for eliciting its multiple functions at different stages of the viral life cycle, such as replication, assembly and movement. Future studies in this direction could lead to a better understanding of the role of the N protein in the life cycle of GBNV at the molecular level.",
