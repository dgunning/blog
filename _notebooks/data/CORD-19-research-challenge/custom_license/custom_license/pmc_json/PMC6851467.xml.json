The diagnosis of AS was made according to stringent clinical criteria, defined a priori, consistent with the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines (6). Eligible subjects had either: (1) persistent upper respiratory tract symptoms, i.e., 11\u201329 days of cough (not exclusively nocturnal) and/or nasal symptoms (rhinorrhea of any quality) which was not improving; or (2) 6 to 10 days of worsening symptoms (substantial worsening of nasal symptoms and/or fever after a period of improvement). We excluded children who: 1) had AS with severe presentation; 2) had received antimicrobial treatment within 15 days before presentation; 3) had evidence of another infection (i.e., acute otitis media or pneumonia); 4) had underlying immune deficiency, cystic fibrosis, ciliary dyskinesis, or major developmental delay, or 5) had asthma or allergic rhinitis as a main diagnosis for the presenting symptoms.

As expected, when more sequences were analyzed per sample, the lines start to plateau [Fig. S1A]. This indicates that even though more sequences were analyzed, few new species were detected. Furthermore, no significant difference (p=0.55) was observed in species richness after the partition protocol was adopted [Fig. S1B and Table 1].",
