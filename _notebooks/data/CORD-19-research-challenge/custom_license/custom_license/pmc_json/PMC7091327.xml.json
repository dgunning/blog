            "text": "From the immunologist\u2019s point of view, the interplay between steroid hormones and the immune system is intriguing. The systemic expression level of sex hormones differs according to age, gender and pregnancy status in women. Most if not all immune cells express receptors for sex hormones. T cells, B cells, neutrophils, dendritic cells, monocytes and natural killer (NK) cells all have been shown to be transcriptionally regulated by estrogen [3\u20135]. The effect of steroid hormones on immune cells has been a target of extensive study [6]. Although a number of laboratories have reported on estrogen\u2019s effects at the molecular and cellular level, the role of hormones in a systemically coordinated immune response has been difficult to ascertain, let alone in the complex milieu of pregnancy. As gestation progresses, estradiol levels in the maternal serum can rise as much as 500-fold against a backdrop of many maternal or placental-derived hormones that also fluctuate in serum. It is clear, though, that the influence of steroid hormones on immune cells occurs throughout the body and affects various organ systems, including the respiratory system during viral infection, and the nervous system during autoimmune attack. Alterations observed in some autoimmune disease states during pregnancy have been linked to estrogen signaling [7\u20139]. Relapse rates of multiple sclerosis decline during pregnancy and rheumatoid arthritis symptoms remit as pregnancy progresses, correlating strongly with estrogen levels [10, 11]. Due to the striking remission in autoimmune symptoms, pregnancy is often described as a time of pure immunosuppression.",

Increase risk of severe Varicella zoster [12], SARS [13, 14], Listeria monocytogenes [15], Plasmodium falciparum [16] infections have all been observed during pregnancy. Since the 1918 influenza pandemic, it has been apparent that pregnant women suffer more severe complications from influenza infections than non-pregnant women (Fig. 1). In 1918, the death rate for men and women of child-bearing age infected with influenza climbed to about 1 % [17]. For pregnant women, the rate was 27 %, and in cases complicated with pneumonia, over 50 % [18]. This pattern is borne out by every major pandemic of the last century, including the recent 2009 H1N1 pandemic [19\u201321]. Furthermore, women in the second and third trimesters have higher mortality and morbidity rates than first trimester women. Similar observations have been made in response to seasonal strains, albeit to a lesser degree [22].\n",

Maternal infections have been associated with spontaneous loss and pre-term delivery [23, 24]. Epidemiological evidence as well as animal model studies suggest that maternal influenza infection may increase the risk schizophrenia and autism in offspring [25\u201328]. These studies suggest that, although the virus is restricted to the maternal lungs, inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 may compromise the fetus. This is no small problem. There are six million pregnant women per year in the United States and it is estimated that ~10 % will be infected by influenza [29]. In pandemic years, the number will increase. Protecting both the mother and the fetus has enormous public health importance.",

The first is that there is a general immune suppression that reduces the likelihood of an antigen-specific response against the semi-allogenic fetus. The origin of the theory from the great transplant immunologist Peter Medawar, actually predates the epidemiological data and much of what we now know about immunology and placental design. Although exact mechanisms of fetal tolerance are still being uncovered, it is clear that the uterus/placenta represents an immune privileged site and that there are multiple mechanisms for keeping local inflammation and specific T-cell response under control [30].",

This was first published 20 years ago and is largely based upon evidence gathered from mouse experimental data and, importantly, at the maternal/fetal interface. Yet researchers have speculated that a shift to Th2 immunity is responsible for the altered responses in the periphery to respiratory viral infections [31] or autoantigens [32, 33]. Most evidence supporting a Th2 shifts derives from studies of material/fetal interface rather than systemic immunity. Although inflammatory events have been shown to be important at critical times at the beginning and end of gestation, for the most part, the uterine environment is biased toward Th2 [34]. Arguments for a Th2 bias in the periphery are much more contentious [35].",

We have found a decrease in the total number of CD3+ T cells in blood. The surge in estrogen and progesterone at the end of the first trimester results in a reversible thymic involution during pregnancy, which is likely responsible for this decrease in both CD4 and CD8 T cells [36, 37]. However, the T-cell defect is more than just a reduction in newly released thymocytes. TSST-stimulated CD45RA+ (na\u00efve) T cells isolated from the periphery during pregnancy show a profound decrease in both Th1 and Th2 cytokines when compared to cells from the same subjects collected in the post-partum period [38]. Therefore, in addition to a reduction in T cell numbers in the blood during pregnancy, the cells have broadly reduced activity when stimulated without any apparent bias toward a Th2 phenotype.",

This could conceivably shift the antigen-specific autoimmune response away from a pathogenic Th1 response.

We have hypothesized that maternal immunity strives to decrease inflammatory events so as not to expose the fetus to potentially dangerous inflammatory signals. However, in exchange for the protection of the fetus, the mother sacrifices efficient viral clearance, which could prove tragic if the exposure level is too great to be contained by the bolstered innate immune system. We have called this a shift to defensive immunity to represent a bias of the mother to defend herself and the fetus without the full activity of responding T and NK cells.

Others have noted similar stability [50, 52, 53]. The observation that individuals have different but stable cytokine fingerprints is intriguing. Not only can these patterns be used as possible biomarkers for disease susceptibility but they might be able to predict the protein content of immune cells. For example, NK cells have a well-described IL-12/IFN\u03b3 loop where IL-12 binding by NK cells leads to enhanced secretion of IFN\u03b3 from stimulated cells. In our cohort, NK cells from subjects with the highest serum concentrations of IL-12 showed a statistically significant increase in IFN\u03b3, demonstrating that the IL-12 in serum was active and influenced the activation status of the circulating NK cells.",

We recruited over 230 women over the 4-year study and measured the seroconversion rate of each influenza A strain in the seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza (TIV) vaccine. In 2009, we adapted our protocol to include the measurement of the pandemic H1N1 response, which was administered in a separate vaccine. We identified no statistically significant differences in seroconversion rates according to trimester of vaccination. However, we observed somewhat lower rates of seroconversion for women vaccinated in the first trimester and for obese women. In a multivariable model, higher baseline antibody levels and prior year flu vaccination were both significantly associated with reduced odds of seroconversion (Sperling et al. in press). The downregulation of immunity that occurs through thymic involution and B-cell lymphopoiesis apparently does not hinder the antibody response to influenza vaccine. Whether this would be true for other vaccines that might rely more on primary responses is not known and should be explored (Fig. 4).\n",

Although biological differences exist in placentation between mice and human [61], some early work in mouse models demonstrates that there is reason to believe that mechanisms impacting immunity in pregnancy are conserved. It has been demonstrated that infection during pregnancy impacts litter size and health [62]. Pregnant mice experience increased mortality that correlates with late-term pregnancy [63], analogous to observations in the final trimester of human pregnancy. These observations have recently been confirmed using the 2009 pandemic H1N1 Influenza A strain [43]. Pregnant mice have altered or delayed cytokine production similar to observations in pregnant women [43]. Even though these models have been used for at least 50 years, the mechanism of increased morbidity and mortality in pregnant mice remains unclear.",

Hormone and hormone inhibitor treatments in animal models have successfully been used to describe the role estrogens play in modulating Multiple Sclerosis [9, 64], a phenomenon originally observed in pregnant women with the disease. We established a second parallel model in non-pregnant mice implanted with hormone pellets. The biodegradable pellets are implanted under the skin and release a steady stream of sex hormone for 21 days. While pregnancy is a complicated process with regularly fluctuating hormone levels, using this model, we are able to control a single variable and contrast these observations with analogous results in the pregnancy model. Using these two models, we found that high expression of estrogen appears to play a significant role during influenza infection. It appears to have protective effects by suppressing inflammatory responses [65], and weight loss is reduced in the estrogen-pelleted mice compared to placebo. However, estrogen also reduces CD8 T-cell cytotoxic activity both directly and as a result of less efficient APC activation. Since CD8 T cells function to kill virus-infected cells, this is likely to be responsible for the delayed viral clearance found during pregnancy. NK cell responses are also reduced during influenza infection, which likely contributes to the delay of adaptive immunity (Pazos et al. manuscript under review).",

While a strong innate immune response seems at odds with late-term pregnancy, our data suggest that boosted defensive immune mechanisms such as increased numbers of phagocytes and elevated defensin levels may represent a compensatory immune mechanism to protect the pregnant mother and child.
