The expression of IL28B, also known as interferon lambda 3 (IFN\u03bb3), is elevated in individuals with the CC rs12979860 and TT rs8099917 genotype, relative to individuals with an non-CC rs12979860 and non-TT rs8099917 genotype.13\u201316 Noteworthy also is that CC rs12979860 and TT rs8099917 genotypes are the favorable IL28B genotype for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection as the elevated expression of IL28B is associated with virus clearance, a positive response to therapy, and a better disease outcome.17\u201320 As IFN\u03bbs are the predominant IFNs induced in epithelial cells by respiratory viruses,21,22 we were intrigued by the possible association between genetic factors associated with IFN\u03bb3 expression and disease outcome.

            "text": "A prospective longitudinal cohort study was performed on 682 previously healthy, full-term infants aged <2 years admitted at the pediatric units of two tertiary hospitals (Centro Asistencial Doctor S\u00f3tero del R\u00edo and Hospital Cl\u00ednico UC-CHRISTUS) and one ambulatory unit (Centro M\u00e9dico San Joaqu\u00edn UC-CHRISTUS) in Santiago de Chile during the winter season of years 2014\u20132016 with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis. Bronchiolitis was defined as an acute lower respiratory tract infection characterized by rhinorrhea, cough, and diffuse wheezes and/or on auscultation.23 Patients\u2019 records were followed until their discharge with all patients receiving standard treatment and fluid management according to clinical guidelines. The length of stay (LOS) in the hospital and Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) admission, days of oxygen use, the requirement for non-invasive (NIV) or invasive mechanical ventilation (IVM), and mortality were considered in the final outcomes. The criteria used to define clinical severity were based on a previously validated bronchiolitis score system ranging from 0 to 14, which incorporates information such as days of hospitalization, admission to PICU, maximum percentage of fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), and required number of days of supplementation and mechanical ventilation (Supplemental Table S1 and ref. 24). In agreement with ref., 24 score values lower than seven were defined as \u201cmild\u201d illness (G2 group), while scores of seven and above were considered \u201csevere\u201d cases of bronchiolitis (G1 group). All individuals with comorbidities, including preterm, neuromuscular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, primary and acquired immune deficiency, Down Syndrome, prophylactic use of palivizumab, congenital heart diseases, immigrants, and tourists, were excluded from the study. All patients were evaluated for the presence of atopic comorbidities (atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, food allergies) and other epidemiological variables (birth weight, sex, eutocic or cesarean delivery, and weight at presentation) as suggested in ref. 23 Clinical data were complemented with a chest X-ray and laboratory analysis. Bacterial infection was suspected when C-reactive protein test was >10 mg/dl (normal value: 1 mg/dl), the leucocyte count >20,000 \u00d7 103 mm3, and based on chest X-ray examination. Parents were requested to answer a questionnaire to enable the identification of any additional epidemiological factor associated with their infants\u2019 disease (breastfeeding at 6 months of age, maternal smoking during pregnancy, tobacco exposure at home, parental history of asthma). Blood tests and virus detection were conducted during the first 48 h of hospitalization. Viral agents were identified using the Seeplex RV15 OneStep ACE Detection Kit (Catalog Number: RV6F01Y), designed to detect adenovirus, human RSV (A and B) (RSV), Coronavirus (229E, NL63, OC43) (CoV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human rhinovirus (A, B, and C) (hRV), enterovirus (EV), Influenza virus (A and B) (IV), human parainfluenza (1\u20134) (hPIV), and the human Bocavirus (1\u20134) (hBoV), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. All enrolled patients tested positive for at least one bronchiolitis-associated virus, and all donated an oral swab sample for SNP determination. Scraping was performed on the entire length of inner cheeks with one sterile cotton swab for about 1 min in a circular motion. The swab was placed in a tube containing 300 \u03bcl phosphate-buffered saline (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 4.3 mM Na2HPO4\u00b77H2O, 1.4 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4) and genomic DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Catalog number: 51306). The study was approved by the institutional review board of the Facultad de Medicina de la Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile (Institutional Review Code: 14-360) and Servicio de Salud Metropolitano Sur Oriente (Resolution Number: 1116) and was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki principles.

Odds ratios (ORs) are reported with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Disease outcomes and severity of bronchiolitis were compared among all patients, while the polymorphism frequency was compared between patients and non-infected controls.25 The clinical symptoms exhibited by patients were analyzed using a two-tailed Fisher exact test for each variable performed in the Statistical Package for the Social Science Software (Version 25, SPSS Inc). The association between polymorphisms and severity of infection was calculated using a two-tailed Fisher exact test with a 2 \u00d7 2 contingency table as described elsewhere using the GraphPad (Version 5.1) and OpenEpi (Version 3.01) software as described in ref. 25 The distribution of Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium (H-WE) was verified by \u03c72 test.26 A Wilcoxon matched-pairs test was used to determine differences between genotype frequencies in the bronchiolitis and control groups. The crude OR values were calculated by univariate analysis using the SPSS V25.0 software package. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Results were confirmed by the SNPstats Web tool (https://www.snpstats.net/).27 The association for each SNP was analyzed in turn with five inheritance models (codominant, dominant, recessive, overdominant, and log-additive). An allele-recessive effect model for rs12979860 and rs8099917 was selected for the final analysis. Data were fitted for the selected covariates (Sex, Hospitalized status, Virus, and Viral coinfection), including one variable of response (Clinical severity). The analysis of association for each SNP was performed with logistic regression analysis summarized with genotype frequencies, proportions, ORs, and 95% CIs. The two SNPs are included in the analysis and linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype analyses were performed. The association analysis of haplotypes was similar to genotypes analysis, using logistic regression (OR and 95% CI). A multivariate stepwise forward and reverse logistic regression analysis was conducted using the SPSS V25.0 software package. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05.",

Clinical symptoms that significantly associated with a severe disease were fever, previous history of costal retraction, regular oral tolerance, cyanosis, or apnea. To the physical exam, infants in G1 exhibited a prolonged capillary refill, severe retraction, presence of dehydration, wheezing, crackles, and prolonged expiration relative to infants in G2 (Supplemental Table S2).",

The allele frequencies for each SNP within the group of bronchiolitis patients were similar to those of the non-infected control cohort, where rs12979860 CC, CT, and TT genotype frequencies were 0.37, 0.44, and 0.19 and rs8099917 TT, GT, and GG genotype frequencies were 0.47, 0.43, and 0.10, respectively.25 A multiple SNP analysis revealed a positive LD value (D\u2019 = 0.8893). A direct comparison of SNPs rs12979860 and rs8099917 genotype combinations between the non-infected control cohort and all bronchiolitis patients showed no significant variation in genotype distribution (Fig. 2b). However, the data do reveal a weighting for homozygote individuals for the major allele (C) in rs12979860 among the ill (Fig. 2b). Within the control cohort, SNP rs12979860 and rs8099917 genotypes were in H-WE (\u03c72 test p > 0.1).25 In bronchiolitis patients, SNP rs12979860 (\u03c72 test 9.7; p = 0.005) and rs8099917 (\u03c72 test 3.84; p = 0.05) genotypes were not in an H-WE, suggesting a possible selection effect most probably associated with the risk of hospitalization. Results further suggest that, when combined, IL28B rs12979860/rs8099917 genotypes differ in their correlation with the risk of hospitalization due to bronchiolitis. While not statistically significant, there appears to be a trend toward hospitalization due to bronchiolitis for haplotypes CC/TT and CT/TT when compared to haplotypes TT/GG, TT/TG, and TT/TT (Fig. 2b and Table 3).",

Analysis of SNP rs12979860 and rs8099917 revealed no correlation with the severity of bronchiolitis for the overall ill population (Fig. 3a, b). These findings are in full agreements with data reported for an Italian cohort of infants suffering from bronchiolitis.28 However, infants homozygotes for the minor allele (T) in SNP rs12979860 or homozygotes for the minor allele (G) for SNP rs8099917 were significantly younger and weighed less at the time of hospital admission (Table 2). We, then, stratified our study population by viral coinfection (with vs. without) or hospitalization status (hospitalized vs. non-hospitalized). Results revealed no correlation between the severity of bronchiolitis and viral coinfection but being homozygotes for the minor allele (G) for SNP rs8099917 linked with a mild bronchiolitis among hospitalized patients (OR: 0.55 (95% CI: 0.32\u20130.95), p = 1; Table 3).

In spite of a previous study, conducted on a cohort of Italian infants,28 that suggested no correlation between IL28B SNPs rs12979860 and rs8099917 and bronchiolitis, we decided to proceed with this project based on the particular genetic background of the Chilean population. The impact of IL28B SNPs among diverse ethnic populations is well documented.17,32 The Chilean population, in contrast to the Italian cohort above, is admixed with ancestral contributions from Europe and Native America, as well as Africa.33 Opposing to what was initially expected, no significant relationship was found between IL28B SNPs rs12979860 and rs8099917 and the severity of bronchiolitis when Chilean subjects were categorized based on the severity of the disease (Fig. 3a, b). Thus, when analyzing the total study population categorized only by disease severity, our findings are in full agreement with the previous study.28 Importantly, however, in contrast to the preceding study, we extended our analysis by additionally stratifying patients by sex (Table 3). Stratifying by sex alone did not directly link to the severity of bronchiolitis (Tables 1 and 6) unless the SNPs are included in the analysis. Results indicate that being homozygote for the minor alleles in rs12979860 (T) and in rs8099917 (G) correlate with a mild disease in girls but not in boys (Table 3). This sex bias was also replicated in the subgroup of RSV bronchiolitis patients (Table 5). The predominance of severe bronchiolitis in boys vs. girls as well a sex bias for other SNPs in bronchiolitis has been previously described by others.34\u201336 Moreover, the association between SNPs in IL28B and sex is also known in the context of an HCV infection.29\u201331 However, to our knowledge, this study represents the first report to link SNPs in IL28B and female sex for bronchiolitis.",

The precise mechanisms underlying the association between mild bronchiolitis and the IL28B genotype in girls are still obscure as this study was not designed to evaluate cytokine expression within the infant population. So, no direct conclusions can be drawn on any association between IL28B expression and disease progression. Nonetheless, the direct correlation between IL28B SNPs rs12979860 and rs8099917 and the differential expression of IL28B has been well documented.13\u201316 Consistent with our observations, a previous report shows that females exhibiting the poorly expressing IL28B non-TT rs8099917 genotype clear HCV as efficiently as males with the favorable highly expressing TT rs8099917 genotype.31 These findings are most probably attributed to known sex-based differences in immunity, which are most evident during the early stages of life.37\u201339 Thus it is reasonable to suspect that the level of IL28B in girls possessing the TT rs12979860/GG rs8099917 haplotype is sufficient to elicit efficiently response to the viral infection giving rise to a mild bronchiolitis as a final clinical outcome. If so, this would indicate that, in the context of both general and RSV bronchiolitis, the TT rs12979860/GG rs8099917 haplotype is protective in girls. Also, our findings support previous reports which suggest that innate immunity links with the outcome of the diseases induced by respiratory viruses, such as RSV.",

We concede that a larger study is needed to fully confirm the current findings. Also, 72% of all cases included in this study corresponded to RSV bronchiolitis (Fig. 1). Based on results reported in Table 5, we cannot discard that this factor alone biases our conclusion regarding the general bronchiolitis population (Table 3). The number of bronchiolitis cases associated with other individual viral infection was insufficient to draw any statistically significant alternative conclusion. Furthermore, the study population that was evaluated herein was sourced from two high complexity hospitals, which may have caused selection bias toward severe patients with respiratory distress. This could explain why the CC rs12919860 and TT rs8099917 genotypes were found enriched within ill individuals when compared to the non-infected control population.25 Finally, this study was focused specifically on the Chilean population, which is genetically distinct from other populations, even when compared with those of other South American neighboring countries.32 This might limit the generalizability of the findings to other populations with different ancestry composition. Notwithstanding these biases, the results presented herein establish a clear link between female sex, TT rs12979860/GG rs8099917 haplotype, and the clinical severity of RSV bronchiolitis in Chilean pediatric patients.",

Genotypes were divided into those homozygous for the minor allele (TT rs12979860 and GG rs8099917) and those with heterozygous or homozygous status for the major allele (non-TT rs12979860 and non-GG rs8099917). The total number of patients in each group was defined as 100%, and the severity of the bronchiolitis was evaluated as a dichotomous variable using Fisher exact test. The number within each box corresponds to the percentage of patients with mild or severe disease",
