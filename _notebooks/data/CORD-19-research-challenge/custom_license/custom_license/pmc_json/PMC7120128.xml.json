It infects epithelial cells of the nose, larynx, trachea, and bronchi, damaging the epithelium of the respiratory system. The influenza A virus consists of eight RNA segments coding for at least ten proteins (Brydak 2008). It is divided into subtypes based on the properties of surface antigens, i.e., neuraminidase (NA) and hemagglutinin (HA). There are 18 antigenic HA subtypes (H1\u2013H18) and 11 NA subtypes (N1\u2013N11) (Tong et al. 2013). Type B influenza virus is not categorized into subtypes. It is divided into two phylogenetically and antigenically different lines: Victoria and Yamagata, which are circulating worldwide in various proportions (Webster et al. 2013).",

Reports concerned the incidence of both clinically and laboratory-confirmed influenza and influenza-like illnesses and also acute respiratory tract infections, according to the criteria set for the surveillance of influenza in the EU. Virological diagnostic tests were performed in the laboratories of the Provincial Sanitary and Epidemiological Stations and were verified in the NIPH-NIH within the influenza surveillance Sentinel and non-Sentinel systems. The tests were performed on clinical samples collected by primary care physicians from patients suspected of being infected with influenza and influenza-like viruses.

In this season, the epidemic was longer than usual (Groeneveld et al. 2018). Influenza A/H3N2/virus infections are considered more severe and more often affecting people over the age of 65, leading to outbreaks in long-term nursing homes and causing a high rate of hospitalization and mortality in this age group.

This report underscores a fleeting viral multifariousness of influenza infection and the need to prepare adequate anti-influenza shots every season. To this end, a quadrivalent vaccine, consisting of two antigens of influenza A subtypes and another two of type B virus, was introduced in Poland as of the 2017/2018 season. Nonetheless, the vaccination rate remained at a dismal level, one of the lowest in Europe, fluctuating between 3% and 4% of the general Polish population. Thus, the epidemiological situation calls for the continuing promotion of awareness and education in the fight against influenza infection through the vaccination programs across all of the population segments.",
