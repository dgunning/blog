CCHF is the most widespread tick-borne viral disease affecting humans, and cases have been reported in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. Serological evidence indicates infection of numerous mammalian species, including wild animals and livestock (e.g., cattle, sheep, and goats) (1). While infected vertebrates are generally asymptomatic, they serve a key role in the maintenance and transmission cycle of the virus as amplifying hosts for the tick reservoir and vector. CCHFV\u2019s main reservoir and vector are ticks of the Hyalomma genus, which are widely distributed throughout large portions of Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, and these current ecological niches are likely expanding (2, 3). The first identification of CCHF cases in Spain in 2016 illustrates how the virus might spread from areas of endemicity to Western Europe with the assistance of migratory birds carrying infected ticks over long distances (4, 5).",

These nosocomial outbreaks are aided by the fact that CCHF initially manifests as a nonspecific febrile illness, thereby increasing its potential to initiate chains of human transmission. Although ribavirin has been used to treat CCHF, its efficacy and utility in clinical settings remain under debate, and no licensed vaccines or alternative therapeutic options are available to prevent disease or treat patients. Therefore, novel antiviral strategies are required to combat outbreaks.",

The CCHFV OTU domain possesses deubiquitinase (DUB) and deISGylase activity, enabling the removal of ubiquitin (Ub) and ubiquitin-like interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) conjugates from their protein targets (7\u20139). Ub and ISG15 are small proteins involved in regulating cellular signaling, including innate immune responses.

            "text": "Protein ubiquitination is required for the expression of type I interferon (IFN), which upregulates hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes critical for rapidly restricting viral replication. Cellular deubiquitinases (DUBs) can dampen IFN responses by removing Ub from key proteins regulating immunity, including RIG-I, MAVS, TRAF3, TBK1, and IRF3 (10). Unsurprisingly, various virus families encode DUB domains. Viral DUBs belonging to the OTU superfamily have been reported for both positive-strand (Tymoviridae and Arteriviridae) and negative-strand (Nairoviridae and Tenuivirus) RNA viruses (7, 9, 11\u201317). Viral DUBs are thought to facilitate viral replication by modulating innate immune responses as well as by reducing Ub-mediated degradation of viral proteins by the proteasome. For example, viral DUB activity of CCHFV OTU and equine arteritis virus OTU suppresses type I IFN signaling during infection (7\u20139), whereas the turnip yellow mosaic virus DUB counters Ub-mediated proteasomal degradation of its polymerase (17). Study of the role of DUBs encoded by positive-strand RNA viruses is hindered by the fact that this protease is involved in viral polyprotein processing required for RdRp maturation, and therefore catalytically inactive mutants cannot be generated. In contrast, negative-strand RNA viruses such as CCHFV do not require DUB activity for their RdRp to function (18). Thus, the ability of CCHFV to remove Ub conjugates is not an absolute requirement for viral growth, although disruption was shown previously to result in enhanced cellular antiviral responses (8).",

            "text": "In addition to Ub, certain viral DUBs can also remove ISG15 conjugates from target proteins. Both Ub and ISG15 are conjugated to lysine (K) residues via a three-step enzymatic cascade, comprising a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a ubiquitin ligase (E3). Ub is constitutively expressed, whereas expression of ISG15 and its conjugating enzymes requires IFN stimulation. Ub conjugation is mediated by hundreds of E3 ligases, whereas ISG15 conjugation relies mainly on one E3 ligase (HERC5) (19, 20). ISGylation appears to be largely restricted to newly synthesized proteins due to HERC5 ribosomal association, thus making ISGs and viral proteins central targets (19\u201321). ISGylation can exert antiviral activity by prolonging antiviral signaling (IRF3, STAT) (22, 23) or by interfering with the function of viral proteins. For example, ISGylation can interfere with oligomerization of viral proteins, which is important for the formation of viral particles and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes (19, 24). Therefore, viral DUBs such as CCHFV OTU are expected to counter innate immune responses by removing Ub and ISG15 conjugates from their target proteins. This makes viral DUBs attractive potential therapeutic targets, as disrupting their activity is expected to enhance immune responses upon infection and hinder viral growth.",

Notably, rescue of a catalytic inactive CCHFV required an additional mutation to alleviate the interactions of the OTU with cellular Ub (C40A/Q16R). This revealed that inactivation or inhibition of the OTU domain of CCHFV can block viral replication. Likewise, an engineered ubiquitin variant (UbV) specific for CCHFV OTU (UbV-CC4) also strongly inhibited CCHFV growth by hindering viral transcription and/or replication. Despite the reported immune suppression function of the OTU, this inhibition was largely independent of OTU-mediated IFN suppression. Therefore, prolonged binding of the OTU to Ub or a CCHFV OTU-specific inhibitor (CC4) blocked viral infection. These data support considering CCHFV OTU to be a prime target for future development of antiviral strategies, as such binding negates the immunosuppression mediated by the OTU and directly inhibits viral transcription and/or replication.",

We previously reported efficient recovery of DUB-deficient CCHFV when Q16 and A129, critical residues involved in Ub binding, were mutated (8). In contrast, previous attempts to rescue virus containing a mutated OTU catalytically active site (C40A) failed. Unexpectedly, a later attempt to generate a recombinant virus with the OTU-C40A mutation was successful. Sequencing the complete viral genome confirmed the conservation of the C40A mutation and revealed the acquisition of a nonconservative change at position 16 of the OTU (Q16P), indicating that Q16P may serve as an adaptive mutation allowing rescue of CCHFV encoding an inactive OTU. Strikingly, Q16 is a critical residue required for Ub binding (8, 25), suggesting that Ub binding to the inactive OTU prevents CCHFV rescue. To examine if disruption of Ub binding is critical for the rescue of the CCHFV-C40A mutant, we added the Q16R mutation to disrupt Ub binding to the OTU of the L-C40A mutant. Indeed, combining the C40A and Q16R mutations resulted in efficient recovery of recombinant CCHFV (Fig. 1a). Sequence analysis of a subsequent passage confirmed the presence of the C40A/Q16R mutations without any additional changes in the viral genome.",

Although a minor reduction in ZsG fluorescence was observed for CCHFV-C40A/Q16R, both the Q16R and C40A/Q16R OTU mutants grew efficiently in BSR-T7/5 cells, which are unable to mount an IFN response during infection (27). In contrast, growth of CCHFV-C40A/Q16R was severely impaired in A549 cells, which do mount a robust immune response during CCHFV infection (8). To confirm that the reduced growth kinetics of both mutant viruses in A549 cells was due to cellular immune responses, we assessed the growth kinetics of these viruses in A549 cells lacking RIG-I (RIG-I KO [knockout]) (Fig. 1d) and found that both CCHFV-Q16R and CCHFV-C40A/Q16R displayed enhanced growth kinetics in the absence of RIG-I signaling. This suggests that OTU activity is not an absolute requirement for CCHFV infection and specifically supports viral growth in IFN-competent cells.",

While the use of immunocompromised mice presents limitations in addressing the immune suppression function of the OTU, this model can nonetheless provide insights into the effects of altered OTU activity on CCHFV disease progression. To examine the effect of OTU mutations on disease, we infected IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice subcutaneously (1 \u00d7 102 50% tissue culture infective doses [TCID50]) and monitored weight and health daily (Fig. 2). All mice started losing weight 3 days after infection. Infection performed with CCHFV-Q16R, in which only Ub binding was disrupted, resulted in illness identical to that caused by wild-type CCHFV (CCHFV-wt); mice succumbed to disease at 4 to 5 days postinfection (dpi), and no clinical differences between these two groups were observed (Fig. 2a and b). Mice infected with CCHFV-C40A/Q16R lost weight at a slightly lower rate and had a prolonged time to death (6 to 7 dpi); 2 of the 8 animals survived infection. Analysis of viral RNA in various tissues at the time of death or euthanasia demonstrated similar viral loads between all the groups, with the exception of the 2 survivors, in which CCHFV RNA levels were markedly lower (Fig. 2c). Together, these data demonstrate that OTU catalytic activity is not required for pathogenesis in mice in the absence of type I IFN signaling, although mutating the catalytic site resulted in mild attenuation in vivo in comparison to active OTUs (wt and Q16R).",

As a result of its inability to cleave substrates, OTU-C40A may display prolonged binding to ubiquitinated substrates, potentially affecting L protein stability or function and ultimately preventing viral growth.

This prevents cleavage by the OTU and thus resembles the inhibitory binding of cellular Ub to L-C40A. Furthermore, UbV-CC4 contains an extended C-terminal tail that forms additional contacts with the OTU, resulting in enhanced affinity. Using UbV-CC4, we set out to investigate the potential antiviral effect of blocking CCHFV OTU activity. As a control, a wild-type-like Ub variant was used in which only the C-terminal di-Gly motif was mutated to alanine (UbV-AA).

To assess if UbV-CC4 is able to inhibit OTU activity from divergent CCHFV strains and other nairovirus species, we performed in vitro OTU activity assays. Increasing concentrations of UbV-CC4 were incubated with purified OTUs and a fluorogenic Ub substrate (ubiquitin 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin [Ub-AMC]). UbV-CC4 inhibited the in vitro OTU activity of all tested CCHFV strains (IbAr10200, AP92, Hoti, and Oman) with similar levels of efficiency, with IC50 values ranging from 12 to 23 nM (Fig. 3f; see also Table S1 in the supplemental material). In contrast, OTUs from other nairovirus species showed relatively poor or no inhibition by UbV-CC4, demonstrating that UbV-CC4 is specific for all CCHFV strains tested but not for more distantly related viruses (Fig. 3g; see also Table S1).",

We analyzed the growth kinetics of a CCHFV-ZsG reporter virus in these cells and measured viral titers and ZsG fluorescence as indicators of viral replication and protein synthesis (Fig. 4a to c) (26). Strikingly, UbV-CC4 robustly reduced ZsG levels at all tested time points, whereas the UbV-AA control did not affect ZsG fluorescence (Fig. 4c). In addition, CCHFV-infected A549-CC4 cells produced very low to undetectable levels of viral progeny, whereas A549-AA cells produced titers similar to those measured for the control cells (unmodified A549 cells; Fig. 4a and b). Infectious titers of CCHFV lacking the ZsG reporter (CCHFV-wt) closely matched the curves determined on the basis of ZsG fluorescence, further supporting quantification of CCHFV-derived ZsG fluorescence to accurately estimate viral growth (Fig. 4a to c). Finally, to ensure that the UbV-CC4-mediated inhibition of CCHFV growth was specific and was not caused by broad antiviral effects of UbV-CC4, we used a Lassa reporter virus (LASV) expressing ZsG (LASV-ZsG) as a control (Fig. 4d). LASV-ZsG growth kinetics are unaffected by UbV-CC4, confirming that UbV-CC4 specifically and potently inhibits CCHFV.",

To investigate if UbV-CC4-mediated inhibition of CCHFV infection depends on enhanced cellular immune responses, we assessed UbV-CC4 antiviral activity in an A549 RIG-I knockout cell line (RIG-I KO). Using the A549 RIG-I KO cells as a basis, we generated additional cell lines stably expressing UbV-AA or UbV-CC4. Interestingly, robust inhibition of CCHFV was noted even in the absence of RIG-I-mediated antiviral responses (Fig. 4e).

Specific OTU mutations have been described that selectively disrupt OTU interaction with Ub (Q16R) or with ISG15 (P77D) or both (A129R) (8, 25, 30, 31). Since UbV-CC4 interacts with the OTU in a manner similar to that seen with cellular Ub, we expected that the Q16R and A129R mutations would prevent UbV-CC4 binding to the OTU and therefore would relieve UbV-CC4 inhibition of CCHFV infection. Recombinant viruses containing these OTU mutations were generated and used to infect cells expressing UbV-CC4. As predicted, mutant viruses CCHFV-Q16R and CCHFV-A129R, which are deficient in Ub binding, were not inhibited by UbV-CC4, whereas CCHFV-P77D, which retains significant Ub binding, was inhibited similarly to the wt virus (Fig. 4c and f to h). We confirmed the specific binding of UbV-CC4 to the mutant OTUs by performing coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 4i). Thus, binding of UbV-CC4 to the OTU domain is required for inhibition of CCHFV infection.",

The VLP assay allows us to address early steps in the replication cycle, such as entry, uncoating, and primary transcription of the encapsidated minigenome. Interestingly, when VLPs were added to UbV-CC4-expressing cells, only a mild reduction in VLP reporter activity compared to the UbV-AA control was detected (Fig. 5a). In order to confirm the VLP results with genuine virus, we used a CCHFV reporter expressing NanoLuciferase (CCHFV-Nluc; Fig. 5b).

We investigated the possibility that UbV-CC4 interferes with CCHFV transcription and/or replication by disrupting the formation of RNP complexes by assessing the interaction between L and NP in the presence of UbV-CC4.

These viral DUBs likely contribute to viral pathogenesis by suppressing innate immune responses. In addition, DUBs of positive-strand RNA viruses are essential for the viral polyprotein processing required for polymerase maturation. Despite being part of the RNA polymerase, DUBs encoded by negative-strand RNA viruses of the family Nairoviridae (termed OTUs) are dispensable for polymerase activity (18). Instead, suppression of host immune responses appears to be the main function of nairovirus OTUs. Here, by mutating the OTU and employing a synthetic Ub variant (UbV-CC4), we characterized the effects of disrupting OTU activity on CCHFV infection. Unexpectedly, we discovered that solely mutating the OTU catalytic site (C40A) abolishes viral propagation, as the prolonged binding to its substrate Ub interferes with transcription and/or genome amplification. Similarly, a noncleavable synthetic Ub variant (UbV-CC4) inhibits propagation of wild-type CCHFV (Fig. 6).",

            "text": "CCHFV propagation in the absence of OTU catalytic activity (C40A) was restored by inclusion of an additional mutation that prevents Ub binding (Q16R), suggesting that binding of the inactive OTU to cellular Ub inhibits viral growth. Importantly, this does not appear to be mediated by a simple difference in affinity levels between OTU-wt and OTU-C40A, as isothermal titration calorimetry results showed no change in the favorability of binding mono-Ub between OTU-wt and OTU-C40A (see Table S2 in the supplemental material). However, cellular Ub is often found as polymeric chains, and CCHFV OTU has been demonstrated to cleave these Ub chains (34). Although structural studies have only revealed interactions between the CCHFV OTU and a single Ub within a well-characterized binding site, there is biochemical evidence suggesting the presence of a secondary binding site in nairovirus OTUs that facilitates interactions with Ub chains (35). When OTU-wt cleaves the Ub chains, it converts a single high-affinity interaction into two lower-affinity ones that facilitate substrate release. On the other hand, OTU-C40A is unable to cleave Ub chains, resulting in a prolonged association with Ub and subsequent blocking of virus replication. Similarly, UbV-CC4 blocks viral transcription and/or replication by prolonged association with OTU-wt due to the absence of the consensus cleavage motif combined with the presence of extra interacting residues increasing binding affinity. In conclusion, prolonged Ub-OTU association, due to the absence of either OTU catalytic activity (C40A) or the Ub consensus cleavage motif in UbV-CC4, appears sufficient to inhibit CCHFV transcription and/or replication.",

            "text": "Unexpectedly, we found that occupying the OTU with UbV-CC4 resulted in strong inhibition of CCHFV transcription and/or replication. This was a notable finding, as CCHFV does not require autoproteolytic processing of its viral RNA polymerase, and inhibition of its DUB was therefore expected to interfere only with its ability to suppress host immunity. Mechanistically, inhibition of CCHFV by UbV-CC4 was characterized by a strong reduction of CCHFV minigenome reporter activity (Fig. 5c and d), whereas early infection events were minimally affected (Fig. 5a and b). Our data support a model in which prolonged binding of the OTU to Ub(V) interferes with the formation of new RNP complexes, thus affecting viral transcription and/or genome amplification. Formation of CCHFV RNP complexes involves interactions of viral RNA, NP, and the L protein. In the presence of UbV-CC4, less NP was associated with L protein in transfected cells, suggesting a possible defect in RNP complex formation (Fig. 5e). NP binding occurs at two distinct sites located at the N and C termini of L (32), which might be differently affected by binding of the OTU to Ub/UbV-CC4, possibly explaining the residual interaction between NP and L detected in the presence of UbV-CC4. The CCHFV L protein harboring the RNA polymerase and OTU is an unusually large protein (\u223c450 kDa), and the tridimensional arrangement of the OTU domain relative to the RNA polymerase is unknown. Therefore, the consequences of prolonged OTU binding to Ub/UbV-CC4 with respect to polymerase conformation and activity are presently unpredictable. It is conceivable that Ub/UbV-CC4 binding to the OTU domain might simply lock the polymerase in an inactive state, preventing RNA synthesis. Structural data combined with in vitro assays will be necessary to further elucidate the precise mechanism of OTU-UbV-CC4 complex interference in transcription and replication.",

UbV-CC4 inhibits in vitro OTU activity of genetically diverse CCHFV strains but has little to no effect on the OTU activity of other nairovirus species (Fig. 3f and g).

Thr10 is conserved across the four tested CCHFV OTUs, whereas the other tested nairovirus species predominantly encode a glutamic acid at that position.
