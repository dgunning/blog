            "text": "Members of the Coronaviridae, within the order Nidovirales, contain positive-stranded RNA genomes that range from 27 kb to 31 kb in size [1]. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), together with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), and the human coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HKU1, belongs to the genus Alphacoronaviruses (http://www.ictvonline.org/). TGEV is an enveloped virus that contains a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of about 28.5 kb in length. Its genome includes nine open reading frames (ORFs) that encode four structural proteins (spike [S], envelope [E], membrane [M], and nucleoprotein [N]), and five nonstructural proteins (the replicases 1a and 1ab, proteins 3a and 3b, and protein 7) in the order 5\u2032-replicase (1a/1b)\u2013S\u20133a\u20133b\u2013E\u2013M\u2013N\u20137-3\u2032 [2]. TGEV was initially identified as the etiological agent of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) in swine in 1946 in the United States [3, 4]. In neonates, TGEV infects the epithelial cells of the small intestines, leading to potentially fatal gastroenteritis. The virus can also lead to infection in the upper respiratory tract and less often, in the lungs [5]. In adults, TGEV causes mild disease. In swine, it is the major cause of viral enteritis and fetal diarrhea in neonates, resulting in significant economic losses [6].",

TGEV strains of varying virulence have been isolated and characterized worldwide [11\u201314]. Some strains have been used to develop modified live vaccines with limited success. In China, a TGE outbreak was first reported in the 1970s. Since then it has been prevalent in many provinces and has become one of the most important viral diarrhea diseases in China. The Chinese TGEV vaccine strain H165 was derived from a virulent field strain H16 by 165 passages in PK15 cells. H165 virus was proven to be safe in piglets and pregnant sows and efficacious against TGEV infection [15]. Vaccines based on the H165 strain are currently commercially available to prevent and control TGEV infections in China. To genetically characterize the Chinese vaccine strain H165 and its parental strain H16 at the molecular level, we determined the complete nucleotide (nt) sequences of the H165 and H16 viruses. To determine the molecular basis for attenuation of the Chinese TGEV vaccine strain, the deduced amino acid (aa) sequences of the structural and non-structural proteins of the H165 and H16 viruses were compared with those of TGEV reference strains, as well as with that of the porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) strain PRCV-ISU-1.",

The findings indicated that the genome sequence was 28,569 nt in length, including a poly A tail of 30 nt. The genome encodes nine ORFs, characteristic of the genus Alphacoronavirus, and 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated sequences of 314 and 274 nt, respectively (which do not include the poly A tail). The predicted ORFs 1a (nt 315\u201312,368) and 1ab (nt 12,326\u201320,368) of the Chinese vaccine strain H165 contained 12,051 and 8,040 nt, encoding the non-structural proteins 1a and 1ab, respectively. ORF 1ab contained a 43 nt region that overlapped with ORF 1a and included a typical coronavirus \u201cslippery site,\u201d 5\u2032-UUUAAAC-3\u2032 (nt 12,332\u201312,338). Based on evidence from other TGEV coronaviruses [20], this sequence causes a \u20131 frameshift during the translation of ORF1a, which results in a portion of the proteins (protein 1ab) avoiding translation termination and containing an additional 2,680 aa. The structural proteins S, E, M and N were found to be encoded by ORFs S (nt 20,365\u201324,711), E (nt 25,815\u201326,063), M (nt 26,074\u201326,862) and N (nt 26,875\u201328,023), respectively. Furthermore, the three non-structural proteins 3a, 3b and 7, were identified to be encoded by ORFs 3a (nt 24,814\u201325,023), 3b (nt 25,094\u201325,828) and 7 (nt 28,029\u201328,265), respectively.

In order to investigate the relationships among TGEV strains and PRCV-ISU-1, a phylogenetic analysis was performed on the genome sequences of strains H165 and H16, strain PRCV-ISU-1, and the available TGEV strains in the GenBank. As shown in Fig. 1, strains H165 and H16 were confirmed to be more closely related to the TGEV Miller strains than the Purdue strains or strain PRCV-ISU-1. To further explore the evolutionary relationship among strains, the S protein sequences were used to investigate genetic relatedness among TGEV strains and strain PRCV-ISU-1. Phylogenetic tree constructed using the available S protein sequences showed that the reference strains were grouped into five distinct clusters (Fig. 2). Strains H165 and H16 formed a cluster with strains Miller M60, HN2002, Miller M6, TS, TSX, 96-1933, TFI, FS772/70, and TO14. Taken together these results, it appears that strains H165 and H16 are more closely related to strains Miller M60, HN2002, Miller M6, and TS than to the other Chinese TGEV strains, even though they are of Chinese origin.\n\n\n",

Some TGEV isolates gradually lose their virulence and developed to be commercially attenuated TGEV vaccines after continuous passages in cell culture. Strain H165, derived from a virulent strain H16 by 165 passages in PK-15 cells, has been proven to be safe in piglets and pregnant sows and displays efficacy against TGEV infection [15]. In this study, sequence analysis showed that passaging of strain H16 in PK-15 cells resulted in 27 nt mutations that caused 16 aa mutations in strain H165 relative to strain H16. The mutation rate observed was lower than that previously attained in studies by Zhang [14] where twenty and thirty-two aa mutations were found in strains Miller M60 and Purdue P115, respectively, when compared to their virulent counterparts. Up to now, there were only seven TGEV strains and one PRCV strain PRCV-ISU-1 had been fully sequenced, though partial sequences of TGEV strains were available in the GenBank. Moreover, only two virulent and attenuated TGEV pairs were reported [14]. Whole genome sequences of strains H165 and H16 will help us to understand the genetic basis of TGEV coronavirus attenuation and enhance the geographic differentiation information among TGEV strains.",

All of the five aa mutations (P48SS, L514PS, F525PS, D671GS, and I740SS) in protein S had also been found to occur in the N-terminal 1,411 aa residues, which had been predicted to expose on the outside of the cell surface or virus particle.

            "text": "In summary, most of the aa mutations identified were located in the functional regions of the TGEV genome, such as in the most variable regions of the protein 1a of the TGEV (S296CORF1a, R653KORF1a, A745VORF1a, and L1900FORF1a), at the N-terminal (P48SS, L514PS, F525PS, D671GS, and I740SS) of protein S and its antigenic site (L514PS, F525PS, and D671GS), as well as in the putative transmembrane domain (F23VE), all of which are hypothesized to have the potential to affect virus replication, signal transport, and antibody neutralization processes associated with TGEV. Future studies could involve generating specific mutants via reverse genetics and characterizing these mutants in animal experiments. In addition, the findings from our study also revealed that six unique nt mutations (G6014TORF1a, T12388CORF1b, T21937CS, T21969AS, A26025CE, and C27507TN) in the genome sequence of Chinese vaccine strain H165 that could be the markers used to differentiate strain 165 from the other strains of TGEV. Furthermore, a rapid differentiation method to differentiate H165 from wild-type viruses of TGEV had been established by restriction fragment length polymorphism of the N gene based on the nt mutation (C27507TN) (data not shown). Whole genome sequences of strains H165 and H16 may enhance our understanding of the evolution of TGEV coronavirus, as well as the other coronaviruses.",
