            "text": "The 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus spread quickly worldwide in 2009. According to a World Health Organization report in April 2010, more than 155 countries reported laboratory\u2010confirmed cases of this virus, including over 17,900 deaths [WHO, 2010]. Of note, most of these fatal cases were reported in developing countries. The 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus infection can be diagnosed reliably with real\u2010time reverse\u2010transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) [Carr et al., 2009; Poon et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Whiley et al., 2009]. However, real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR equipment can be too expensive or unwieldy to have onsite for many small and front\u2010line laboratories, which requires personnel to ship the isolated clinical samples to outside laboratories equipped for the procedure. Even if the real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR equipment is available onsite, processing of samples using this technique takes more than 2 hr. In contrast, immunochromatography assays can be performed typically in just 10\u201315 min with a convenient diagnosis kit, but this method is not sensitive enough for accurate diagnosis of the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus infection [Chan et al., 2009; Faix et al., 2009]. Because the H1N1 influenza A virus is especially impactful in developing countries, which often have limited facilities, rapid and accurate diagnostic methods that can be used in poorly equipped laboratories should be developed.",

LAMP can be completed within 30\u201360 min at 60\u00b0C. A reverse transcriptase (RT) reaction was available before LAMP (RT\u2010LAMP); RT\u2010LAMP has been used successfully to detect human pathogenic RNA viruses [Hong et al., 2004; Poon et al., 2004, 2005; Fujino et al., 2005; Okafuji et al., 2005; Ushio et al., 2005; Ito et al., 2006], and has already been developed to detect the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus [Kubo et al., 2010]. Specifically, RT\u2010LAMP targets the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) gene, with 97.8% sensitivity and 100% specificity in clinical samples compared with the corresponding measurements for real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR specific to 2009 influenza A H1N1 virus. However, the traditional RT\u2010LAMP method requires a heat block, and a freezer in which the necessary reagents are stocked. A mobile LAMP system for anthrax diagnosis was developed recently using a disposable pocket\u2010warmer as a heating device [Hatano et al., 2010]. This advancement is particularly convenient because disposable pocket\u2010warmers are cheap, and are well\u2010known winter commodities in Japan. Thus, the pocket\u2010warmer LAMP method requires no expensive or specialized equipment, such as heat blocks or thermocyclers. The aforementioned anthrax study showed that the sensitivity and specificity of the pocket\u2010warmer LAMP method were similar to those of the conventional LAMP method that uses a heat block [Hatano et al., 2010], making it a potentially powerful diagnostic tool for poorly equipped laboratories in areas of pandemic infection. In the present study, the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus\u2010specific pocket\u2010warmer RT\u2010LAMP (pwRT\u2010LAMP) system was developed, and its sensitivity and specificity were evaluated using nasal swab samples from individuals with flu\u2010like symptoms. A dried form of the LAMP reagent was also examined to develop a mobile diagnosis system that does not require heat blocks or freezers.",

Fifty\u2010six total patients including 43 males and 13 females were enrolled. The mean age of the patients was 31.6 years (range: 20\u201351 years). All patients who presented with histories of fever or feverishness, and coughs and/or sore throats within 5 days of symptom onset were included in this study. A specimen was collected from the nares of each patient with a dry swab tip; tip of the collection swab was inserted approximately 3 cm into the nares and rolled several times in each nostril. Subsequently, the tips of the swabs were placed in the solutions of QuickVue tests Influenza A + B (Quidel Corporation, San Diego, CA). In addition to the clinical samples, supernatants of 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus (strain A/Tokyo/NIID1/2009(H1N1)), seasonal influenza A (H1 [strain New Caledonia 20/99], H3 [strain Hiroshima], H5 [strain A/HK/Z13/03]), influenza B, para\u2010influenza virus types 1 and 3, respiratory syncytial (RS) virus (type A), human metapneumovirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus\u2010infected cells were used as positive or negative controls.",

Finally, a set of six primers, which was comprised of two outer primers (forward primer F3 5\u2032\u2010AAGCTCAGCAAATCCTACA\u20103\u2032 and backward primer B3 5\u2032\u2010TCCCTCACTTTGGGTCTT\u20103\u2032); two inner primers (forward inner primer [FIP] 5\u2032\u2010GACTTTGTTGGTCAGCACTAGTAGAAAAGGGAAAGAAGTCCTCG\u20103\u2032 and backward inner primer [BIP] 5\u2032\u2010TCTATCAGAATGCAGATGCATATGTTGCTATTTCCGGCTTGAA\u20103\u2032); and two loop primers (forward loop primer [LF] 5\u2032\u2010GATGGTGAATGCCCCATAGC\u20103\u2032 and backward loop primer [LB] 5\u2032\u2010TTTTGTGGGGTCATCAAGATACAG\u20103\u2032) that recognize eight distinct regions on the target sequence, was designed by using the LAMP primer design software Primer Explorer (version 4; Eiken Chemical, Tokyo, Japan; http://primerexplorer.jp/elamp4.0.0/index.html). The target for the RT\u2010LAMP assay was based on 529\u2013716 nt in the HA gene sequence of GenBank GQ165814, from the strain A/Narita/1/2009(H1N1). All primers used in this study were synthesized by Sigma\u2010Genosys Japan (Tokyo, Japan).",

For each pwRT\u2010LAMP assay, 9 \u00b5l of extracted RNA was added to 41 \u00b5l of master mix containing 25 \u00b5l of 2\u00d7 reaction mix, 1 \u00b5l of enzyme mix, 2 \u00b5l of fluorescence detection reagent (LMP\u2010221; Eiken Chemical), 40 pmol FIP and BIP primers, 5 pmol outer primers (F3 and B3 primers) and 20 pmol loop primers (LF and LB primers).

A previous study showed that the temperature of a disposable pocket\u2010warmer in a Styrofoam box reached 58\u00b0C in 30 min and remained around 60\u00b0C for more than 60 min [Hatano et al., 2010]. In addition, this study revealed that the temperature inside a Styrofoam box was consistent both under cold (4\u00b0C) and warm (37\u00b0C) conditions [Hatano et al., 2010]. Thus, the pwRT\u2010LAMP was used in the present study to detect the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus. Observation under UV or ambient light showed that the pwRT\u2010LAMP system coupled with the HA primer set detected 100 copies of target RNA per reaction volume (both in 25 and 50 \u00b5l) after incubation for 60 min (Fig. 1A). To confirm the specificity of pwRT\u2010LAMP, RNA samples extracted from seasonal influenza viruses and other RNA viruses were also examined. These results clearly showed that the pwRT\u2010LAMP system detected the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus, but not the other viruses, including the seasonal influenza A (H1, H3, H5) viruses (Fig. 1B). The sensitivity and specificity of pwRT\u2010LAMP corresponded with the results from conventional RT\u2010LAMP that used a heat block at 60\u00b0C for 30 min (data not shown).",

Of the 56 samples, immunochromatography tests detected influenza virus type A or B in 11 samples (19.6%), whereas real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR detected the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus in 27 samples (48.2%). Of the 27 samples identified as positive for 2009 H1N1 by real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR, pwRT\u2010LAMP and pwRT\u2010LAMP with dried RNA Amplification Reagent positively identified 26 (96.3%) and 27 samples (100%), respectively. In contrast, only 11 of the 27 samples (40.7%) were positively identified by the immunochromatography tests. All pwRT\u2010LAMP reaction tubes were visualized by both a UV transilluminator and under ambient light, and determined the results of reactions were identical under both types of light, which suggests that ambient light is sufficient for identification of positive signals. In addition, the samples were subjected to conventional RT\u2010LAMP with a turbidimeter. The threshold times, defined as the time (in seconds) needed to reach the threshold turbidity level (0.1), significantly correlated with virus copy number as determined by real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR (R2 = 0.7858, Fig. 3). Conventional RT\u2010LAMP detected the virus in all 27 samples that were found positive by real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR (Table I). These findings indicate that the pwRT\u2010LAMP technique detects the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus in clinical samples with sensitivity and specificity similar to real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR and conventional RT\u2010LAMP.",

Furthermore, a disposable pocket\u2010warmer that contains iron powder, water, vermiculite, activated carbon, and salt is easily obtainable via the internet (i.e., if outside of Japan), and costs less than US$1, suggesting that this system can be established quite easily with low cost.",

Since real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR and RT\u2010LAMP amplify target genes, the sensitivity of these assays is much higher than immunochromatography, which detects viral antigens immunologically. It is possible that the virus copies in some nasal swab samples were not sufficient for detection by immunochromatography. In addition, since immunochromatography can detect influenza A and B, there may be certain mutations in the amino acid sequences of the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus HA that cause the virus to go unrecognized by the antibody. However, immunochromatography for 2009 H1N1 virus was recently developed [Miyoshi\u2010Akiyama et al., 2010]. Although this method works as a means of quick diagnosis for the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus, its sensitivity still may not be high enough for accurate diagnosis, because it is an immunological method and the amount of virus titer in nasal swabs may be insufficient for detection. Thus, the pwRT\u2010LAMP method is more sensitive than immunochromatography, and offers diagnoses that are more accurate.",
