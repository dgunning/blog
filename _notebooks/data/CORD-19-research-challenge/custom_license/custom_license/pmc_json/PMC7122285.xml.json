            "text": "The word \u2018 ignorance\u2019 has some rather negative connotations. In general, ignorance is a mental state or condition of existence that most people want to avoid. We undertake study at school, college, and university with a view to acquiring knowledge and ridding ourselves of ignorance. We watch television programmes about astronomy, politics, and history because we want to be well informed and knowledgeable about the world around us. We experience affirmation when we are told that we have extensive knowledge of a topic or discipline, and embarrassment or even shame when our lack of knowledge or ignorance in an area is exposed. Ignorance can cause us to fail an examination, prevent us from obtaining an academic or professional qualification, and lead to negative appraisal from an employer. With such negative consequences related to a lack of knowledge, it seems strange for anyone to claim that ignorance can be a valuable resource, particularly when we are engaged in and decision-making in medicine and health. Yet, that is exactly what I will claim in this chapter. It will be argued that ignorance is too often disparaged when it is, in fact, central to many of the deliberations that we engage in on a daily basis. By way of illustration, consider the following scenario. I want to attend a cousin\u2019s wedding in Dublin and decide that I should make the trip by train. I walk into the train station on my way home from work and pick up a timetable. It shows that there are two stops on the journey from Belfast to Dublin. These stops are at Dundalk and Drogheda. A friend later enquires if she can travel with me on the train as she wants to attend a music festival in Newry. She asks me if the Dublin train stops at Newry. I reply that it does not.",

I use this lack of knowledge to conclude that the train does not stop in Newry. Moreover, I draw this quite legitimately. After all, if the train did stop in Newry, this should be shown in the timetable. The fact that Newry does not appear in the timetable is all the grounds I need to conclude that the train does not stop at Newry. In the next section, it will be shown that this argument satisfies two conditions on the use of the argument from ignorance, or at least the non-fallacious use of this argument. We will see in this chapter that there are many other circumstances where an argument from ignorance is not rationally warranted. But first, let us consider another scenario where this argument is employed, this time in an issue related to medicine and health. A new cholesterol-lowering drug is undergoing clinical trials before it is launched onto the market. The pharmaceutical company that is developing the drug has tested it on 10,000 human subjects with elevated blood cholesterol in centres in the USA, UK, France, Australia, and China. The purpose of the trials is to establish that the drug is effective in lowering blood cholesterol, and that it can do so without causing harm in the form of adverse reactions or side-effects. A panel of independent experts in pharmacology is brought together to examine the results of these trials. After a wide-ranging review of the evidence, the panel concludes as follows:",

The panel has argued from a lack of evidence (or knowledge) that the drug causes harm to the conclusion that it does not cause harm. Like the \u2018train\u2019 argument, this use of the argument from ignorance is also warranted. After all, a large multi-site trial involving 10,000 participants has been conducted. Also, the results of the trial have been reviewed by a panel of experts in the area. If the drug did cause harm, the trial and subsequent review would reveal that to be the case. Because there is no evidence of harm, the panel can safely conclude that the drug does not cause harm. This argument illustrates yet again that there are certain contexts in which arguing from a state of ignorance or lack of knowledge (or evidence) is warranted. Moreover, these contexts are as likely to involve expert scientific issues such as drug safety as they are more mundane issues like planning a train journey. The logical merits of the argument remain the same regardless of whether the argument is advanced by scientific experts or lay people. This fundamental observation will resonate throughout the chapters in this book.",

            "text": "The sections in this chapter will unfold as follows. In Sect. 2.2, we consider some of the reasons logicians, philosophers, and others have given for rejecting the use of the argument from ignorance. It will be argued that the characterization of this argument as a weak, fallacious, or invalid form of reasoning usually betrays certain assumptions about what it means to know something. These assumptions contain hyperbolical standards for knowledge which, it is claimed, no practically-situated rational agent can attain. In Sect. 2.3, we examine the logical and epistemic conditions under which use of the argument from ignorance is rationally warranted. These conditions\u2014a and an \u2014were fulfilled in the arguments from ignorance examined above. There are many situations, however, where these conditions are not fulfilled and the argument is unwarranted in consequence. In Sect. 2.4, we examine some of those situations within a wider assessment of the use of the argument from ignorance in medical and health contexts. Finally, in Sect. 2.5, we consider some of the ways in which reasoning in medicine and health can be facilitated by use of the argument from ignorance. On these occasions, it is useful to conceive of the argument as a cognitive heuristic or a mental shortcut that bridges gaps in our knowledge. An examination of the features of this heuristic\u2014we will call it an ignorance heuristic\u2014will conclude the discussion of this chapter.",

In advocating the use of ignorance in argument, I am not suggesting that people should actively avoid acquiring knowledge about the many different things they experience in their lives. My stance is not a call to reject education and learning, and to live in a state of self-imposed ignorance. It is quite the opposite, in fact. The use of ignorance in argument is proposed as a means of increasing our knowledge. There is no contradiction between advocating that we use ignorance during reasoning and recommending that we undertake efforts to eradicate ignorance through education and learning.

We saw earlier that ignorance can expose us to risk from infectious diseases like HIV and hepatitis. It can also lead us to adopt lifestyles that damage our health, and prevent us from engaging with health checks and screening programs (e.g. bowel cancer screening). Indicators of ignorance about health are easy to find. Jalloh et al. (2017) interviewed 1413 randomly selected respondents from 9 out of 14 districts in Sierra Leone about their knowledge of Ebola three months into the 2014 outbreak. Only 42% of respondents linked Ebola to a virus.

This simple example of how the closed world assumption can fail to hold in a particular case powerfully illustrates that there are certain conditions on the use of ignorance in argument. Not just any absence of knowledge or evidence can provide logical grounds for a conclusion. Moreover, the conditions under which the closed world assumption may not be presumed to hold are as numerous as the different types of knowledge bases at the centre of this assumption. On some occasions, there may be information that is relevant to a particular domain D but that cannot be contained in our knowledge base K because inadequate time has elapsed for this to occur. Just such a scenario arose in the 1980s during the BSE epidemic in the UK, when the public was encouraged to continue eating beef and beef products because there was no evidence that BSE transmitted to humans. It was known at the time that BSE was a spongiform encephalopathy and, as such, would have a lengthy incubation period. It would take many years before scientists would know if BSE could transmit to humans. Certainly, the absence of evidence of BSE transmission to humans in the early months of the epidemic could not be used as grounds on which to conclude that BSE does not transmit to humans. The closed world assumption did not hold in this case because information about the transmission properties of BSE was not present in our knowledge base about this new disease, and could not possibly be present in the early months following the emergence of BSE.",

This raises the question of what constitutes adequate time. For a disease like BSE with a lengthy incubation period, the passage of just a few months was certainly inadequate. But this judgement becomes more difficult to make as we encounter longer periods of time. Would we also be inclined to describe 10 years or 20 years as inadequate? Would the failure of BSE to transmit to humans after 30 years be sufficient grounds on which to conclude that BSE does not transmit to humans? We are beginning to see some of the complex judgements that arguers must make as they attempt to evaluate the rational merits of different arguments. Moreover, time is not the only condition that may affect whether the closed world assumption holds in a particular case. If investigators have not had at their disposal the resources that are required to establish if a certain proposition P is true, then we can conclude nothing at all from the fact that there is no evidence that P. Imagine the proposition that we are interested in is the claim that restaurant workers in a certain large city are carriers of A. However, due to budget cuts, there is a lack of trained staff to take blood samples from restaurant workers and to test these samples for the presence of hepatitis A in the laboratory. We certainly could not say under such circumstances that the lack of evidence that there are restaurant workers who are carriers of hepatitis A leads us to conclude that such workers do not exist. The closed world assumption does not hold in this case because investigators have been constrained by budget cuts from adding any information about the hepatitis A status of restaurant workers to the knowledge base K.",

For example, if we are told that a particular pesticide has been in extensive use for the last 50 years and there is no evidence that it has caused ill health in humans, then we can be reasonably certain that it does not cause ill health in humans. The two markers that lead us to believe that the closed world assumption obtains in this case are the fact that the pesticide has been in extensive use and that it has been in use for 50 years. The former marker\u2014we will call it the dose marker\u2014lets an arguer see that there has been widespread exposure of humans to the pesticide in question. The latter marker\u2014we will call it the temporal marker\u2014lets an arguer see that a sufficient period of time has elapsed in which adverse health effects, if they were to occur, would have become evident. Other linguistic markers capture the size of an investigation and the expertise of investigators. Imagine for a moment that you are told that 10,000 restaurant workers in New York are tested for hepatitis A in an epidemiological investigation that is conducted by public health experts in the city\u2019s health department, and there was no evidence that restaurant workers are carriers of hepatitis A. Then you would feel reasonably certain in concluding that restaurant workers are not carriers of hepatitis A. In this case, the two markers that are the basis of your certainty are the fact that there has been a large investigation\u201410,000 restaurant workers were tested\u2014and that the investigators had the requisite expertise to conduct the investigation.

However, the scientists who are reviewing the results from the epidemiological study decide to examine only 2500 blood test results from restaurant workers who are employed at establishments in the north of the city. We would be very much disinclined to accept any claim based on what was not found during such a limited search of the knowledge base. By the same token, we would also be unlikely to accept a claim based on a search of the knowledge base, even a very extensive search of the knowledge base, if that search were conducted by non-expert reviewers. Even medically qualified or scientifically trained individuals may not have the requisite expertise to assess the epidemiological implications of a large number of blood test results for hepatitis A. So while we are prepared to accept the verdict of a panel of infectious disease epidemiologists who have conducted an extensive review of the knowledge base, we are much less likely to do so if we are told that gastroenterologists or astrophysicists undertook the review. The judgements that are required to decide if the extensive search criterion is satisfied in a particular case are no less complex than those needed to determine if the closed world assumption holds in a certain context.

Shortly after the first cases of BSE emerged in British cattle, a group of investigators published a significant article in the journal Neurology. The article concerned a spongiform encephalopathy in sheep called scrapie. The question of interest to the investigators, Brown et al. (1987), was whether there was any epidemiological evidence to suggest that scrapie had transmitted to humans. Brown et al. concluded that there was no evidence that scrapie in sheep had transmitted to humans. The basis of their ignorance claim was a review of the world literature on CJD as well as an examination of the results of a 15-year epidemiological study of CJD and scrapie in France. In other words, the available evidence was very extensively examined by Brown and his colleagues. Moreover, these investigators were expertly qualified to make an assessment of the evidence. The lead author, Paul Brown, and two of his co-authors were based at the Laboratory of Central Nervous System Studies at the U.S. National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. A further co-author, Richard Raubertas, was affiliated with the Division of Biostatistics at the University of Rochester Medical Centre in New York. We will call these features the comprehensiveness marker and the expertise marker, respectively. A search of a mundane knowledge base, such as the journeys in a train timetable, does not need to be undertaken by experts. In this case, an expertise marker may be superseded by a competence marker\u2014the individual who is examining the timetable is presumed to have a certain minimum level of competence.

This is an example of public health communication that was responsibly conducted and rationally warranted. Instances of the sound or rationally warranted use of the argument from ignorance are, however, quite rare in medical and health contexts. Fallacious arguments from ignorance are relatively common in these contexts.

Recognizing that this announcement would cause widespread concern among the thousands of British women who had also received PIP implants, the Chief Medical Officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies, released a press statement to the public and wrote a letter to general practitioners, Medical Directors in the National Health Service (NHS), and cancer and plastic surgeons. The press release and letter, which were issued by the Department of Health in the UK on the same day as the French Government\u2019s announcement, made extensive use of \u2018no evidence\u2019 statements. Two examples of these statements are shown below:Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies said: \u2018Women with PIP implants should not be unduly worried. We have no evidence of a link to cancer or an increased risk of rupture. If women are concerned they should speak to their surgeon.\u2019 (Press statement: Chief Medical Officer statement on breast implants)\nIn the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is not [\u2026] recommending routine removal because they have no evidence of any disproportionate rate of implant rupture.

This was some six months before the expert group that was tasked with examining the safety of PIP implants produced its final report on 18 June 2012. This group was chaired by Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS Medical Director. An interim report was produced by Sir Bruce and his colleagues on 6 January 2012. However, even the findings of the interim report were not available to the Chief Medical Officer when she embarked on providing reassurance to the public about the safety of PIP implants on 23 December 2011. The haste with which reassurance was offered about the safety of PIP implants was later found to be misguided.

At the end of June 2010, AFSSAPS told the MHRA of delays to their product testing. At that point, the MHRA decided to commission a specific series of tests (the Ames tests) to measure the genotoxic activity of chemicals in PIP silicone. These are the tests that the Chief Medical Officer describes in her letter to NHS staff. The results of these tests were uniformly negative. However, these tests and their results really tell us nothing at all about the claims that are central to the Chief Medical Officer\u2019s \u2018no evidence\u2019 statements. It will be recalled that one of those claims concerns the rate of rupture of PIP implants relative to other types of implants. No amount of genotoxicity and chemical toxicity testing could address this concern. This issue could only be addressed by the investigation led by Sir Bruce Keogh as part of the work of his expert group.",

Her repeated use of \u2018no evidence\u2019 statements suggested that a closed knowledge base was already available to investigators when this was in fact not the case. Toxicity tests of PIP silicone certainly contributed important information to the knowledge base. But these tests could not address questions about the rupture rates of PIP implants that were at the heart of the messages of reassurance offered by the Chief Medical Officer. Answers to these questions awaited the final report of the expert group led by Sir Bruce Keogh. However, this group did not publish its report until 18 June 2012, some six months after the advice given to the public and medical professionals by Professor Dame Sally Davies. This advice was misleading and, on the question of PIP implant rupture rates, was shown ultimately to be inaccurate. The argument from ignorance was \u2018overplayed\u2019 by the Chief Medical Officer in an effort to reassure PIP implant recipients in the UK that there was no need to adopt the precautionary approach taken by French authorities. There was no closed knowledge base or extensively searched knowledge base, as the Chief Medical Officer\u2019s statements appeared to suggest. Both awaited the findings of the investigation conducted by Sir Bruce Keogh\u2019s expert group. The knowledge base on PIP implant safety did contain information about the toxicity of chemicals in PIP silicone. But this information was erroneously used by the Chief Medical Officer to force the closure of the knowledge base, and draw a reassuring conclusion about PIP implant safety based on the absence of any evidence relating to the rupture of implants (Fig. 2.4).\n",

The knowledge base on PIP implant safety has been subjected to extensive scrutiny. This has necessitated an examination of the type of information that was contributed to the base, as well as an assessment of how and when this information was obtained, and whether it relates to the claims advanced by the Chief Medical Officer. Needless to say, this level of scrutiny exceeds the interest and intellectual curiosity of most members of the public, perhaps even most PIP implant recipients. This is exactly why fallacious uses of the argument from ignorance are so dangerous. They can easily strike us as a persuasive form of argument when further analysis reveals that they are anything but rationally warranted. Some logical protection is afforded if we keep the closed world assumption and extensive search criterion at the centre of our attention. In this case, it became apparent quite quickly that the Chief Medical Officer was overstating the closure of the knowledge base on PIP implant safety. Repeated use of \u2018no evidence\u2019 statements did little to disguise the fact that the knowledge base lacked information relating to the rupture rates of PIP implants. And the results of toxicity tests, which did form part of the knowledge base, were unable to address this critical aspect of PIP implant safety. Alongside the overuse of \u2018no evidence\u2019 statements, another feature of this scenario that should have alerted us to a potentially fallacious use of the argument from ignorance was the timing of the Chief Medical Officer\u2019s statements. These statements were a hasty reaction to the precautionary measures taken by the French Government. They were not arrived at in a reflective way and in full consideration of the conclusions of the expert group led by Sir Bruce Keogh. Only the latter could truly be said to close the knowledge base on PIP implant safety.",

The overuse of \u2018no evidence\u2019 statements to frame reassurances about safety is often an indication that the argument is being used fallaciously.The absence of linguistic markers that suggest defeasibility is often a sign that the argument from ignorance is being used fallaciously.

Rather, the argument is more or less rationally warranted under certain conditions. When there is a closed knowledge base and an extensively searched knowledge base, the absence of evidence that p is true is reasonable grounds for concluding that p is false. In this final section, we examine non-fallacious uses of the argument from ignorance in more detail. A proposition that cannot be located in a knowledge base following investigation of a question or issue and an extensive search of the base can quite legitimately be claimed to be false. But what makes us want to terminate an investigation and draw a conclusion based on ignorance rather than leave an inquiry open on an indefinite basis? After all, some evidence may be forthcoming that might definitively address an issue one way or another and avoid the need to draw an inference based on an absence of knowledge or evidence. The reason we do not allow investigations and other forms of inquiry to be continued on an indefinite basis is that reasoning is not a purely theoretical exercise. Rather, it is conducted within the practical sphere of action. In this sphere, we are all practically-situated cognitive agents who must make decisions and take courses of action in order to thrive and survive. None of us can afford the luxury of interminable cognitive deliberation, especially not if we want to find food and shelter and protect ourselves from various threats in our environment. Each of these goals requires actions to be performed within certain time constraints. And for this to occur, deliberation must come to an end.",

            "text": "Nowhere is the demand for action more keenly felt than in medicine and health. An infectious disease outbreak will not await the conclusion of exhaustive investigations by scientists and public health officials before it takes its grim toll on the lives of human beings. Preventative measures must often be taken in advance of the completion of an investigation and on the basis of scarce evidence. Decision-making in the absence of complete evidence is not an unusual state of affairs in medicine and health. Just such a scenario characterized the early public health response to HIV/ AIDS before scientists had even succeeded in identifying a blood-borne virus as the causal agent of this novel disease. It was also the basis of the human Specified Bovine Offal (SBO) ban that was instituted in November 1989 and that was to prove a decisive measure in protecting human health from BSE. But even decision-making in the absence of evidence must be guided by some type of rational procedure. The argument from ignorance, I contend, is just such a procedure. Its function is that of a mental shortcut or cognitive heuristic that allows us to bridge gaps in our knowledge and arrive at a warranted claim that can become a basis for action. As events unfold and new evidence emerges, the claim in question may need to be rejected. The inherent defeasibility of the argument from ignorance means that its conclusion may be subject to revision. But until this is necessary, its conclusion can provide a tentative basis for action in a context where inaction could have serious consequences for human health. Inaction in the presence of extended deliberation can certainly avert an erroneous decision and course of action. But it is a poor pro-survival cognitive policy by any reasonable standard.",

            "text": "So the use of ignorance as a heuristic is motivated by the action orientation of the practical sphere, and particularly the need to terminate deliberation and pursue a course of action. Inquiry and other forms of deliberation place considerable demands on the resources, including attention and memory, of cognitive agents. These resources are finite in nature and must be sparingly deployed. Deliberation is also a time-intensive process as agents interrogate all aspects of a problem or issue. Through its termination of deliberation, the ignorance heuristic is achieving important economies in terms of time and resources for cognitive agents. This is the hallmark of all heuristics. They are \u2018fast and frugal\u2019 procedures that do not expend the resources of their more systematic counterparts in reasoning (Gigerenzer and Goldstein 1996). The scientist or health worker who must respond to an emerging infectious disease or other health problem can employ heuristics as a rational strategy for managing decision-making under the pressure of the practical sphere. The termination of deliberation and subsequent acceptance of a claim that the ignorance heuristic makes possible gives investigators some epistemic foothold in an incomplete evidential base. That foothold permits decisions and actions to be taken in the absence of evidence, such as when the human SBO ban was instituted in advance of any knowledge of the transmissibility of BSE to humans. The epistemic and practical gains that accrue from action in the absence of evidence outweigh the costs associated with error, and the costs associated with total inaction until such times as evidence becomes available. Against these alternatives, the ignorance heuristic is an effective use of our rational resources, and is not the \u2018fallacy\u2019 that many commentators have argued is the case.",
