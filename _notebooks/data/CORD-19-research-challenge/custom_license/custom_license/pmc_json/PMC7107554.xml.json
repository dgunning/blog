Since coming into force in 2007 states have worked, individually and collectively, to meet their IHR core capacity requirements3 to contain public health threats as defined under the new framework.4 Starting in 2012, WHA Member States agreed to annually survey their performance to meet the IHR core capacity criteria,5 and report their performance to the WHO Director-General for her/his annual report to the World Health Organization (WHO) Executive Board and WHA.6 Meeting the IHR core capacity requirements has had varying success as the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa demonstrates.7",

            "text": "One significant shift within the revised IHR was that states agreed to openly and promptly report outbreaks with the potential for \u2018international spread\u2019. This represented a significant shift from past practice which involved a focus on adopting the relevant quarantine measures to a \u2018legal instrument [that sought] to ensure global health security through a collective approach\u2019.8 States agreed to the development of detection and response capacities at both the national and international level: this entailed the creation of an IHR National Focal Point, to be available 24/7 in every country to communicate outbreak events with WHO. It also required WHO to provide an alert service to the international community of reports it received that may present a potential PHEIC. Michael Baker and David Fidler argued after the IHR\u2019s adoption that one of the strengths of the revised IHR was the inclusion of a provision that gave WHO the right to receive reports of disease outbreak events from sources other than the affected state: Article 9\u2014Other Reports. Specifically, Article 9 permits WHO to \u2018take into account reports [of outbreak events] from sources other than notifications or consultations and shall assess these reports according to established epidemiological principles and then communicate information on the event to the State Party in whose territory the event is allegedly occurring\u2019.9 The article also referred to the following: \u2018only where it is duly justified may WHO maintain the confidentiality of the source\u2019.10",

This article identifies an implementation gap between what is stated in the IHR\u2014the right of WHO to receive reports from informants other than the state and to protect the identity of those informants\u2014and the reality that states remain able and willing to act to ensure that this right not be exercised. The article examines two cases, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and West Africa Ebola outbreak, to explore how WHO has attempted to balance in both instances the state\u2019s need to manage risk communication against WHO and the non-state actors\u2019 right to report relevant outbreak information.",

            "text": "The article develops in three steps. First, it examines some of the issues arising from the management of non-state reports that contradict state reports. This is a particularly pressing concern in politically sensitive environments where individuals may be at risk of state reprisal for reporting disease outbreaks. The second section of the article explores how WHO has responded to situations where non-state reports contradicted state reports: the first MERS outbreak in Saudi Arabia in 2012; and the confirmation of Ebola viral fever in Guinea in early 2014. Both cases illustrate the tensions that arise for WHO in receiving and acting upon non-state sourced reports. In the final section of the article the rarely discussed human rights implications of outbreak surveillance, response, and reporting are explored. To date, reporting practices have been understood as exclusively a matter of relations between states and the WHO. This article contends that this understanding is problematic since the right to report, as conceptualized under the revised IHR, requires a corresponding right for non-state actors to issue reports directly to the WHO. This section presents the case for introducing balance between WHO\u2019s need for good relations with states with the need to protect individual informants; for WHO to be able to act on information in situations where the state may not be disclosing all information it has to hand; and to guarantee the confidentiality of informants (as provided in Article 9). To navigate these difficult issues more attention should be paid to the accountability, transparency, and human rights provisions embedded within the IHR.12",

The WHO is well placed as a legal and normative authority vis-a-vis the IHR to suggest and articulate a disease reporting framework with respect to human rights principles. This article primarily focuses on the relationship between three actors: the WHO (including both Headquarters and regional offices, unless otherwise stated); the state; and non-state actors (defined below) who have the capacity to detect and report outbreaks. This focus does not deny the important role of other organizations within the United Nations, as well as national and international non-state actors in detecting, reporting, and responding to disease outbreak events. The focus in this article is on operationalizing the right to report as conceptualized in Article 9 under the IHR; it is intended to begin the discussion on who needs to be included and who may require protection to realise this right.",

WHO issued a travel advisory for China during the height of the outbreak, specifically stating \u2018many questions\u2019 were yet to be answered about the state of the outbreak in Guangdong province.17 Two years later, WHO\u2019s receipt of non-state reports and authority to act on receipt of these reports was formally adopted under Article 9 in the revised IHR. This was a significant achievement for WHO and regarded as vindication of the WHO\u2019s efforts, during SARS but also previous outbreaks, to demand greater reporting transparency from states.18 It was also referred to as a new dawn for global health governance in that non-state actors were recognized, for the first time under a WHO legal instrument, as being partners in outbreak response and containment.19",

Much focus has been on the obligation to ensure that during a PHEIC, affected governments have effective risk communication strategies to control and direct the flow of information through one source\u2014the Health Ministry or the executive level of the government.20 However, the value of Article 9 was that it permitted the WHO to listen to other sources and not rely solely on governments\u2014particularly if the government is suspected of covering up the true extent of the health crisis. This was the importance of Article 9: accommodating the potential for the WHO to receive reports and protect the confidentiality of non-state sources.",

The first independent panel review was carried out in 2011 and assessed WHO\u2019s response to the H1N1 outbreak in 2009. The review found that WHO\u2019s response to the outbreak was justified based on the information it had to hand; but its coordinated response to public health outbreaks needed further reform to ensure full compliance with the IHR by states and the WHO itself. On the specific matter of reporting and response, the review noted that during the H1N1 outbreak there \u2018was no systematic monitoring by WHO of instances where human rights are not respected in implementing the IHR\u2019. The report noted that the WHO and affected populations were disadvantaged by the organization having no mandate to investigate when a state breaches human rights with regard to the IHR.21 This is a finding the article returns to in the third section.",

The WHO failed to activate existing policies and procedures (provided within IHR) to deal with the initial stages of the outbreak because of the (mis)judgements relating to the declaration of a PHEIC.

Dr Ali Mohamed Zaki, an Egyptian national and Professor of Microbiology at the hospital, took a sample of sputum to identify the cause of the sickness. When he could not detect a positive with any known suspected diseases, he contacted Dr Ron Fouchier at Erasmus Medical College in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Suspecting a novel virus, Dr Zaki sent a sample to Dr Fouchier\u2019s lab.

Dr Zaki explained he did this for two reasons. First, he believed that the potential risk of MERS to the upcoming Haji Pilgrimage necessitated immediate notification to potential travellers and overseas hospitals who may see individuals with coronavirus symptoms in pilgrims on return from Mecca. A second related reason he went to ProMED was that he distrusted the Saudi government would share the diagnosis rapidly to ensure that countries could detect MERS infections.26 That very month, the notification Zaki gave assisted with the identification of a MERS-infected patient in the UK.27 After the ProMED notice, the Saudi government immediately dismissed Dr Zaki and revoked his working visa, which forced his immediate return to Egypt.",

Brutal tactics were reportedly used by military and police against political opponents and journalists.69 In July 2014, only months before the Ebola outbreak, approximately 200 protestors were killed and hundreds were wounded in violent confrontation with the government.

The WHO\u2019s Public Health Emergency Operations Centre Network (coordinated under auspices of WHO Global and Response Operations) and the proposed new WHO Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response, need to be able to receive information from non-state sources including individuals and Internet surveillance platforms like ProMED,77 and to verify these reports without jeopardizing the individual reporter. However, open source reporting depends upon political environments that permit and support full disclosure and facilitate open communication.78 Even if this information is contradictory to the state\u2019s message. Again, the need for WHO to receive reports other than the state under Article 9 is there, arguably, for the situations when states attempt to conceal outbreak information. The MERS and Ebola cases reveal the constraints and the confusion. Drip feed information from the state, discrepancies between confirmed and suspect cases, and threats to those who provided reports that contradicted the state in both cases eroded the trust of civilians (and neighbouring states) in the reports being received. This loss of trust compromised public trust in the government\u2019s capacity to manage outbreak control. In this context, the choices before WHO were not easily resolved.79 Siding with the government built government trust, but at the cost of WHO receiving and acting upon information that contradicted the state. At the cost of the international community trusting WHO to protect populations not states. Alternatively, there is no certainty that acting on non-state reports, in both instances, would have produced a different state response without risk of retribution to the non-state actor(s) such as health care workers in Saudi Arabia and MSF in Guinea.",

            "text": "The final section of the article explored the relationship between the freedom to report that underpins Article 9 and the human rights obligations of both states and the WHO to permit transparent reporting conditions. Despite the inclusion of human rights language in the revised IHR, there has been little discussed or operationalized within the IHR Emergency Committee advisories on PHEICs, to date, that promote the human rights responsibilities of the WHO and states during outbreaks. Denying the individual right to report whether by political repression, intimidation, or neglect, has the potential to impact on future outbreak events when scientists, health professionals, and media may hesitate to communicate for fear of reprisal. WHO has a delicate role to play here, but the revised IHR is the best instrument available to permit the WHO to balance states\u2019 concern with managing risk communication against the individual right to report situations that may provide vital insight into an emergency situation.",

The WHO and its Member States have a responsibility to bring human rights discourse into their public health emergency outbreak response.",
