In addition, HLH patients with documented EBV infection had a lower rate of CNS involvement and a higher rate of cholestasis, which suggests the tropism of organ involvement in EBV\u2010associated HLH.

This leaves the possibility of the presence of cryptic genetic mutation in the patients designated as having presumed secondary HLH, thus requiring cautious interpretation of our results. Another limitation of the present study is that a larger portion of patients, who were enrolled during early period of the study, has not been tested for genetic mutation and was thus designated as having unspecified HLH. There are no reliable clinical criteria to distinguish familial and secondary HLH. Therefore, we could not further define the patients with HLH without genetic evaluation or family history, even though they were reported to have possible triggering causes.

A multicenter prospective trial is warranted to identify the subgroups of patients with HLH with poor prognoses and find optimal treatment for these cases.
