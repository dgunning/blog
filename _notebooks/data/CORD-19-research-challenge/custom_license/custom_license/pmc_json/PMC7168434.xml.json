We used these highly glycosylated S proteins as a probe for S protein affinity histochemistry and fluorescent staining to investigate the binding characteristics and tissue tropism of serotype 1 FCoVs. The FIPV UU4 S protein primarily bound to macrophages, suggesting a strong macrophage tropism for FIPV strain UU4. Our failure to observe any effect of S protein binding to macrophages after NA pre\u2010treatment suggests that a factor(s) other than sialic acid is responsible for this tropism of serotype 1 FIPV strain UU4. Furthermore, results of S protein histochemistry and FCoV IHC, which were characterized by positive staining in macrophages, suggest that the tissue distribution of FIPV S protein\u2010bound cells correlates with that of FIPV antigen\u2010positive cells and the cell tropism of FIPV.",

After treating S proteins with PNGase F to remove N\u2010glycans, the molecular weights of both expressed FIPV UU4 and FECV UU7 S ectodomains were reduced to about 170 KDa, suggesting that the S protein ectodomains produced in the HEK293 cells are highly glycosylated. Indeed, using N\u2010glycosylation site prediction services available from the Center for Biological Sequences 33, at least 13 and 14 N\u2010glycosylation sites were predicted in the FIPV UU4 S protein and FECV UU7 S protein, respectively. Proteins secreted by mammals often contain obligate post\u2010translational modifications, including addition of the disulfide bonds and unique glycosylation patterns that are required for proper folding and/or biological activity. We believe that the S protein expressed in the HEK293 system undergoes obligate post\u2010translational modifications to better bind receptors on cell surfaces. Using the recombinant proteins expressed by the HEK293 system performing S affinity histochemistry on tissues from cats, we demonstrated the binding and interaction of FIPV UU4 S protein with tissue macrophages and feline blood PBMCs.

Sialic acid binding is associated with the pathogenicity of several other coronaviruses. For example, the enteropathogenicity of transmissible gastroenteritis virus in piglets is associated with sialic acid binding of S protein 34, 35, 36. In FCoVs, it has been demonstrated that the sialic acid binding capacity of the S1\u2010N\u2010terminal domain can be lost after some serotype I FIPV strains switch to a macrophage tropism 28, and that the S protein of FCoVs appears to be responsible for macrophage tropism 5, 29. In our study, we found that FIPV UU4, but not FECV UU7, was able to bind on the tissue macrophages and that that binding was not affected by NA pre\u2010treatment. Our results also suggest that a factor(s) other than sialic acid is responsible for the macrophage tropism of serotype I FIPV strain UU4.",

Given that intestinal enzymes cause extremely rapid post\u2010mortem cellular autolysis of the intestine, the failure of S proteins to bind to enterocytes may be attributable to loss of the membrane integrity of enterocytes. Although the S affinity histochemistry approach used in the present study could serve as a good tool for studying virus\u2013host receptor interactions in paraffin\u2010embedded tissues, it has limited use in tissues with poor membrane integrity, such as autolytic tissues or intestines. Hence, the present findings concerning interaction of both viral S proteins with their host receptors in the intestine in paraffin\u2010embedded tissues are inconclusive. Further studies of FECV S affinity histochemistry using feline primary enterocytes or enteric cell lines may reduce the limitations of S affinity histochemistry in paraffin\u2010embedded tissues.",

In fact, in our study most tissue macrophages were not recognized by FIPV UU4 S protein. In cats with and without FIP, only some macrophage sublineages bore cellular receptors that were recognized by FIPV UU4 S protein. Indeed, some tissue macrophages are not permissive for FIPV infection, as shown by the failure to detect FIPV antigens in some proliferating macrophage populations, including macrophages in splenic red pulp in cats with FIP infection 37, 38. Future studies aimed at determining which macrophages sublineages are susceptible to FIPV infection would be interesting. Moreover, individual differences in the sustainability and susceptibility of monocytes to infection between cats has been reported 39, indicating that host factors likely also affect interactions between host receptors and S protein binding affinity. We identified fewer FIPV UU4 S than FCoV IHC protein\u2010bound macrophages/monocytes by S histochemistry. This decreased binding of S protein in affinity histochemistry most likely resulted from tissue damage during slide preparation or loss of cell integrity in pyogranulomatous lesions associated with FIP.",

Because tissue damage during slide preparation or loss of cell integrity may have reduced the detection sensitivity of S affinity histochemistry, in the course of our studies we performed S fluorescent staining and flow cytometry to more sensitively and quantitatively detect S protein binding on PBMCs, FCWF\u20104 cells and CRFK cells. By using the S fluorescent staining and fluorescent microscopy, we demonstrated that binding of FIPV UU4 S protein to PBMCs occurs in less than 1% of cells (Fig. S1a) and that binding of FECV UU7 S protein on PBMCs was undetectable (Fig. S1b). Using S fluorescent flow cytometry, we detected binding of FIPV UU4 S and FECV UU7 S protein on 15.5% and 7.4% of monocytes gated based on forward scatter and side scatter, respectively (Fig. S1D). We observed no to minimal signals on both FCWF\u20104 cells and CRFK cells by S protein affinity fluorescent staining and flow cytometry (Fig. S1C and E). These results indicate that both FIPV UU4 S and FECV UU7 S proteins can recognize small numbers of feline monocytes, which supports that the contention that cell tropism between FIPV and FECV occurs at a post\u2010receptor step of infection 40. Additionally, S affinity histochemistry may be less sensitive for studying the attachment pattern of FECV I in paraffin\u2010embedded tissues, which could be attributable to the low cellular receptor/co\u2010receptor density of FECV I. Moreover, the limited growth of serotype I FCoVs in both FCWF\u20104 and CRFK cell lines was possibly caused by the poor binding affinity of FCoV I S protein to these cells.",
