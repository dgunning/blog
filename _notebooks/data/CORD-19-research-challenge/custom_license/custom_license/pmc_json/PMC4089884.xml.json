The three main helices unique to the SHAPE-directed\nmodel were thus unable to form in the truncated sequences analyzed\npreviously. Two of these helices, the alternate lower stem and the\nhelix that sequesters the slippery sequence, appear to mutually stabilize\neach other because disruption of either of these helices by LNA binding\ndestabilized or induced refolding of the other (Figure 2). Additionally, the anchoring helix likely stabilizes both\nof these helices. The frameshift domain adopts the same structure\nwhether the genomic RNA is probed directly after extraction from virions\nor is first heat-denatured and then refolded. This similarity suggests\nthat the differences between the SHAPE-directed model and the conventional\nmodel are due primarily to the presence of the complete sequence of\nthe viral RNA that was used in development of the SHAPE-directed model.\nCo-transcriptional RNA folding thus apparently does not alter the\nfolding of this region of the genome.

This work illustrates\nthe influence of global sequence context on RNA structure and the\nability of SHAPE probing to reveal complex functional domains in large\nRNAs.",
