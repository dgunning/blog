In humans, this atypical apolipoprotein is highly expressed in several tissues including the central nervous system (CNS), unlike other apolipoproteins which are essentially produced in liver and intestine [1\u20133]. In rodents, apoD expression is found primarily in the CNS. In the brain, high apoD expression is observed in the hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex and the substantia nigra [4], mainly in glial cells (astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) but also in a few neurons [5\u20138].",

            "text": "Supporting this hypothesis, studies revealed that overexpression of apoD (or its orthologs) in transgenic mice, Drosophila and Arabidopsis lead to increased resistance to oxidative stress [17\u201320] and inflammation [21]. Conversely, apoD inactivation in mice, plants and flies resulted in decreased resistance and ultimately reduced survival in response to oxidative stress [17, 18, 22]. It was further established that apoD specifically prevents lipid peroxidation but not protein carbonylation in response to oxidative insults [17]. This anti-oxidant effect of apoD on lipids is mediated through a highly conserved methionine residue (Met93), converting reactive to non-reactive lipid hydroxides [23, 24]. ApoD may also influence inflammatory pathways via the regulation of arachidonic acid (AA) signalling and metabolism [21]. Indeed, it was suggested that apoD could stabilise AA into the cell membrane or sequester AA, reducing the availability of free AA and thus preventing its conversion into pro-inflammatory molecules [25, 26]. Another way for apoD to prevent neurotoxicity lies in its capacity to bind several ligands involved in neurological injuries. ApoD can bind AA, progesterone and sphingomyelin, with high affinity, as well as cholesterol, bilirubin and estradiol, with lower affinity.",

Earlier work demonstrated increased apoD levels in the hippocampus of kainic acid-treated rats [27, 28]. Kainic acid (KA), an analogue of glutamate, can induce the overactivation of glutamate receptors and is widely used as a model to explore excitotoxic processes in neurodegenerative injury [29]. Because of the abundance of kainate receptors, the hippocampus is more sensitive to KA-induced neurotoxicity [30]. Also, glutamatergic pathways seem to be particularly affected in apoD knockout mice with a 20 % decrease of kainate receptors in the CA 2\u20133 subfields of the hippocampus, a global decrease in AMPA receptors and a global increase in muscarinic M2/M4 receptors [31]. These changes may potentially contribute to the impairments in learning and memory and in motor- and orientation-based tasks observed in these animals [17], all of which involve glutamatergic neurotransmission.",

Because the FVB/N mouse strain is more vulnerable to KA lesions [32], all mice were backcrossed into the FVB/N background (Charles River, Canada) for at least ten generations. Genotyping was performed by PCR on tail biopsies as described previously [17]. In all experiments, 12\u201316 weeks old male wild-type (WT) and H-apoD Tg littermates were used. The animals were housed under standard conditions at constant temperature (20 to 22 \u00b0C) and humidity (50 to 60 %), under a 12-h light/dark cycle and had free availability to water and food. All mice were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation after being anesthetised with Isoflurane (PPC, Richmond Hill, ON, Canada).

Results of preliminary dose\u2013response experiments revealed consistent seizures with a mortality of less than 10 % in animals injected with a KA dose of 15 mg/kg. This dose was used in all following experiments. For behavioural assessment, animals (17 mice for each group) were monitored every 5 min for behavioural seizures during 2 h, and the seizure intensity were blind-scored following a modified Racine\u2019s classification [33]: \u2018stage 0\u2019, no seizure and normal behaviour; \u2018stage 1\u2019, immobilisation; \u2018stage 2\u2019, myoclonic jerk and head nodding; \u2018stage 3\u2019, bilateral forelimb clonus and rearing; \u2018stage 4\u2019, continuous rearing and falling; \u2018stage 5\u2019, loss of posture; and \u2018stage 6\u2019, running and jumping seizure. For each mouse, the sum of all seizure intensity was also calculated by adding the seizure scores observed in all 5 min intervals during 2 h following KA injection. The latency to stages 2, 3 and 4 seizures was also monitored. Animals that did not present these \u2018stage\u2019 seizures were given a value of 120 min.",

To investigate the time-course of endogenous apoD expression in the mouse hippocampus following KA treatment, WT mice were injected with KA (15 mg/kg; i.p.) and the hippocampus was processed for the detection of apoD protein at days 1, 3 and 7 post-injection. In parallel, the expression of the classic reactive astrocyte marker GFAP, known as a neurotoxicity marker after brain injury [36], was also assessed [37]. Endogenous apoD protein started to accumulate 1 day following KA injection and peaked at day 3 (2-fold induction) compared with non-injected mice (NI) (Fig. 1a). Hippocampal apoD expression returned to baseline levels 7 days post-injection. In a similar manner, the relative hippocampal expression of GFAP protein (Fig. 1b) began to increase on day 1 post-injection, with its highest expression at day 3 (3-fold induction), corresponding to the neurotoxicity peak. GFAP levels, as for apoD, were lower at day 7 although still significantly higher than in non-injected animals. Overall, these data show that KA treatment induces apoD accumulation in the hippocampus of mice, a phenomenon which is concomitant with astrocyte activation.\n",

To investigate the effect of H-apoD overexpression on the generation of KA-induced seizures, WT and H-apoD Tg mice were injected with KA and their behaviour was recorded for 2 h post-injection. Seizure behaviours were assessed according to two scoring systems: the seizure index and the cumulative score. KA injection induced seizures of significantly lower severity in H-apoD Tg mice compared with WT animals (Fig. 2a, left axis). In addition, the sum of all seizure scores (cumulative score) that mice experienced over that time was 2-fold lower in H-apoD Tg mice (26.3 \u00b1 3.06) compared with WT animals (50.12 \u00b1 4.12; Fig. 2a, right axis). We also assessed the latency to reach stage 2 (myoclonic jerks of the head), stage 3 (bilateral forelimb clonus and rearing rearing) and stage 4 (continuous rearing and falling) seizures. If the animal did not present these \u2018stage\u2019 seizures, the latency was considered as 120 min. Compared with WT mice, the latency to seizure onset was significantly higher in H-apoD Tg mice (Fig. 2b). This onset was delayed by 34 \u00b1 14.5 min for stage 4. In stage 3 occurrence, this difference was further emphasised. Indeed, the onset of stage 3 seizures was observed 57 \u00b1 13 min later in H-apoD Tg mice than in WT animals. No significant difference was observed for the latency to seizure stage 2 between WT and H-apoD Tg mice. These results suggest that H-apoD overexpression in transgenic mice induces an increased resistance to KA-induced seizures. We thus explored the mechanisms involved in such protection.\n",

KA-induced cell apoptosis, a consequence of seizures, was assessed in hippocampal sagittal sections from WT and H-apoD Tg mice using TUNEL labelling, at day 3 post-injection (corresponding to the astrogliosis and apoD peaks) (Fig. 3). In WT mice, TUNEL labelling was present in different hippocampal subfields (CA1, CA3, hilus of the dentate gyrus) (Fig. 3c). In contrast, in the hippocampus of H-apoD Tg mice, TUNEL staining was decreased in the different subfields (Fig. 3d). Moreover, at day 3 post-KA injection, the overall level of cell damage, quantified as total TUNEL fluorescence in the H-apoD Tg hippocampus was significantly reduced compared with WT mice (Fig. 3e). These results indicate that H-apoD expression confers protection against KA-induced cell apoptosis.\n",

Since that apoD production is accompanied by GFAP activation following KA challenge (Fig. 1b) and based on the significant resistance of H-apoD Tg mice against seizures and hippocampal KA-induced apoptosis, we examined the presence of inflammatory processes in the hippocampus of WT and H-apoD Tg mice at day 3 post-injection. In the hippocampus of WT mice, KA injection resulted in significant astrocytic (GFAP; 3-fold) (Figs. 1b and 4a, b) and microglial activation (Mac-2; 3-fold) (Fig. 4a,c). It also induced expression of COX-2, an inflammatory mediator which promotes the recurrence of seizures and neuronal loss [41] (Fig. 4a,d). Interestingly, in response to KA treatment, H-apoD Tg mice display lower levels of Mac-2 and COX-2 than their WT counterparts. However, H-apoD Tg mice also display robust GFAP activation in their hippocampus, comparable with levels detected in WT animals. Together, these data demonstrate that the expression of H-apoD significantly attenuates inflammatory responses consequent to KA-induced excitotoxic neurodegeneration, except for the activation of astrocytes.\n",

We thus analyzed the expression of PMCA2 in the hippocampus of WT and H-apoD Tg mice.

In contrast, NR2B levels were significantly reduced in H-apoD Tg mice (30 % decrease) (Fig. 6a, d). Because NMDAR are essential mediators of brain plasticity, we also examined the effect of neuronal H-apoD overexpression on synaptophysin, a marker of neuronal terminals reflecting synaptic plasticity processes [43]. Interestingly, synaptophysin levels were not altered in the hippocampus of H-apoD Tg compared with WT animals (Fig. 6a, e).

To investigate the effect of apoD on intracellular cholesterol content, primary hippocampal neurons grown for 10 days were treated with purified H-apoD for 24 h. The intracellular cholesterol was then stained with filipin, which can bind cholesterol. H-apoD-treated hippocampal neurons (Fig. 8d, f) showed less cholesterol/filipin staining than untreated neurons (Fig. 8(a, c)), consistent with our observations in the brain of H-apoD Tg mice (Fig. 7). Interestingly, the cholesterol/filipin content of neurites remained unchanged in H-apoD-treated neurons (Fig. 8(c\u2019, f\u2019)). To improve further our understanding of the processes involved in apoD-mediated reduction of cholesterol content, we then assessed the effect of purified H-apoD on the neuronal uptake of exogenous cholesterol. Hippocampal neuronal cultures were pre-incubated for 3 h in the presence of cholesterol and further exposed or not to purified human apoD for 24 h. Cholesterol uptake was stained by filipin. Filipin staining showed cholesterol accumulation in hippocampal neurons pre-incubated with exogenous cholesterol (Fig. 8(g)). Interestingly, this accumulation was decreased by 50 % following purified H-apoD incubation (Fig. 8(h, i)). Overall, these results show that apoD is involved in the regulation of intraneuronal cholesterol content.\n",

It was also proposed that neurons, which express very little or no apoD, can import it from surrounding glial cells [11]. However, apoD internalisation by neurons in normal and stress conditions was never demonstrated. To address this question, hippocampal neuronal cultures (at 10 days) were pre-incubated for 24 h with purified H-apoD and further exposed to kainic acid (100 \u03bcM) or control conditions for 24 h. The exogenous apoD internalised in neurons was detected by immunocytochemistry, using a specific antibody raised against human apoD. Under physiological conditions, purified human apoD was detected mostly in the perinuclear area into vesicular compartments in soma and neurites (Fig. 9a (b)). Kainate treatment provoked an important intracellular and nuclear accumulation of H-apoD (Fig. 9a (c)). This data demonstrates that apoD can be internalised in neurons and that this internalisation is accentuated in stress conditions.\n",

In accordance with previous studies [48], we observed that KA-treated neurons displayed an important accumulation of cholesterol (Fig. 9b (b)) compared with non-treated neurons (Fig. 9b (a)). Interestingly, H-apoD pre-treated hippocampal neurons (Fig. 9b (c)) showed less cholesterol/filipin staining than non-pretreated neurons (Fig. 9b (b)) in response to KA toxicity. As previously demonstrated, KA treatment induced an important uptake of exogenous apoD, which co-localised with cholesterol (Fig. 9b (c)). Overall, our results show that internalised apoD attenuates the increase in intraneuronal cholesterol content induced by KA treatment.",

Such peak of apoD production corresponds to that of astrocyte activation and proliferation, as documented by increased GFAP levels. The concordance in time of apoD and GFAP levels is in line with the fact that astrocytes are one of major site of apoD production in the CNS [1, 6, 8]. In addition, increased synthesis of apoD in astrocytosis has been observed following enthorinal cortex lesion [16], coronavirus OC43-induced encephalitis [21], experimental stroke [57] and ageing processes [58]. However, it remains to be determined if apoD production is a cause or a consequence of astrocytosis. Nevertheless, astrocytes may not be the sole source of apoD production as after KA injury, apoD was also detected in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus [28]. The peak of apoD production also correlated with increased apoptosis, as assessed by TUNEL labelling. Increased apoD expression has been reported in pathologic conditions with increased apoptosis and a potential role of apoD on the death-survival balance was suggested [59].",

However, the molecular mechanisms involved in seizure-induced cell death are not clearly understood. A tight relationship between COX-2 and seizures severity and induced cell death was reported in both in vivo and in vitro models of excitotoxicity [41, 63\u201365]. KA treatment was shown to immediately induce COX-2 expression thus facilitating the recurrence of hippocampal seizures [41, 66]. Interestingly, the COX-2 induction was reduced in KA-injected H-apoD Tg mice. The effect of apoD on COX-2 downregulation might be mediated through the control of arachidonic acid (AA) levels. First, apoD could influence the availability of free AA, its preferential ligand, in the cell by binding/chelation, limiting its use in enzymatic pathways such as COX-2 [25, 67].",

Our results further demonstrate that the anti-inflammatory effects of apoD in KA response are mediated by limiting microglial but not astrocytic activation. It has already been established that inhibition of microglial activation exerts neuroprotective actions against KA-induced injury [68, 69]. The effects of apoD on microglia activation might be COX-2-dependent considering that COX-2 contributes to microglial activation [70, 71]. However, as COX-2 regulates both microglia and astrocytic activation, the fact that H-apoD Tg mice display, at day 3 after KA treatment, similar GFAP but decreased Mac-2 levels compared with WT mice suggests that the response to COX-2 reduction due to apoD overexpression is faster in microglia than in astrocytes.",

            "text": "Another pathway by which apoD could be protective is by increasing the Ca2+ buffering capacity of neurons. Excessive influx of calcium into neurons, as generated by the overactivation of glutamate receptors by KA plays a critical role in seizure genesis [72, 73] and triggers diverse cellular death mechanisms [74, 75]. Intracellular calcium homeostasis requires several mechanisms, including Ca2+ efflux, which can be carried out by PMCA. The expression of the most abundant isoform in the CNS, PMCA-2, is decreased after KA exposure [42, 76]. It is likely that, by stimulating the production of PMCA-2, the presence of H-apoD in neurons contributes to lower intracellular calcium levels and consequently the detrimental effects of excitotoxicity in H-apoD Tg mice. However, the mechanism by which apoD influences PMCA-2 levels remains to be determined. As the increase of intracellular Ca2+ content by excitotoxicity stimulates the generation of reactive oxygen species [77] and lipid peroxidation, which in turn downregulates rapidly PMCA levels [78], it is possible that apoD affects PMCA-2 levels through its anti-oxidant properties. Indeed, apoD and its orthologs have been shown to protect from pro-oxidative insults in several organisms [17\u201319, 22].",

It is well established that the activation of NMDAR-mediated neuronal death or survival pathways depends on its subunit composition and subcellular localisation [79\u201382]. Indeed, activation of NR2B containing NMDARs increases neuronal apoptosis and in contrast, the action of NR2A-containing NMDARs promotes neuronal survival pathways in rat models (in vitro and in vivo) of ischemic stroke [80, 83]. The downregulation of NR2B levels in H-apoD Tg mice hippocampus, with unchanged levels of NR1 and NR2A subunits, might contribute to limit seizure severity and detrimental effects such as apoptosis in response to KA challenge. However, NR2B downregulation in surface membrane at synaptic sites of rat striatal neurons has been reported to produce synaptic plasticity alterations [84]. Of relevance, this NR2B downregulation does not affect the expression of the presynaptic vesicle protein synaptophysin [85\u201387], suggesting normal synaptic plasticity mechanisms. However, how apoD controls NR2B levels remains unknown and needs further attention.",

A direct association between dysregulation of cholesterol homeostasis and neurodegeneration has been clearly demonstrated in several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s, Huntington\u2019s and Niemann-Pick type C disease [88], pathologies which also show an upregulation of apoD. In accordance with cholesterol dysmetabolism in neurodegenerative diseases, it was reported that intracerebroventricular injections of KA in rats resulted in an increase in immunoreactivity to cholesterol in the affected CA fields of the hippocampus [47]. An accumulation of cholesterol was also demonstrated in our primary neuronal cultures exposed to KA treatment. Interestingly, our results show an important increase in the internalisation of H-apoD in KA-treated primary mouse neurons. Moreover, the addition of exogenous H-apoD to KA-treated primary neurons reduced their cholesterol content. Altogether, our study suggests an important role for apoD in regulating cholesterol metabolism in the injured brain. Cholesterol, an integral component of neural membranes, is crucial for the neuronal functions such as axon guidance and synaptic transmission [89]. Cholesterol is mostly synthesised in astrocytes and transported to neurons by apolipoprotein E-containing lipoproteins even though neurons can also produce cholesterol in their cell bodies [88].",

            "text": "Our results show that H-apoD Tg mice harbour decreased levels of cytosolic cholesterol but similar total cholesterol levels in their brain compared with WT mice. This suggests that apoD favours cholesterol redistribution, namely to membranes, or elimination. In support to this, mice lacking apoD display an increase of specific fatty acids in their brain with a decreased ratio of cholesterol:total phospholipids in the membrane compartment [90]. Excessive intraneuronal cholesterol is eliminated by its conversion to 24-hydroxycholesterol (24-OHC), which can cross the blood brain barrier and reach the liver for elimination [91, 92]. This capacity to convert cholesterol to 24-HOC is specific to neurons [49]. However, in this study, we could not detect significant differences in the levels of membrane-bound cholesterol and we demonstrated that 24-HOC pathway is not involved in the decreased cholesterol levels of the cytosolic brain fraction in transgenic mice that overexpress neuronal apoD. Thus, apoD seems to utilise another pathway to regulate intraneuronal cholesterol levels. Other cholesterol transporters, including the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and high-density lipoproteins (HDL), are involved in the regulation of cholesterol efflux, namely in cortical neuronal cultures [50]. It is worth mentioning that apoD is primarily associated with high-density lipoproteins in human plasma. However, the relation between apoD and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters has not yet been defined. Moreover, apoD associated with HDL-like particles found in the cerebrospinal fluid [93] could be involved in the cholesterol efflux mediated by the ABC transporter pathway. ApoE is also known to be involved in cholesterol efflux in astrocytes [50] as a compensatory mechanism to maintain the cholesterol homeostasis in the brain [94]. Of relevance, it was reported that apolipoprotein E-deficient mice display an increased expression of both apoD and ABCA1 [94]. In light of this and other studies, we could propose that increased apoD in neurodegenerative diseases is protective against ongoing neuronal stress culminating in neuron loss, although we cannot directly compare the apoD levels present in the brain of transgenic mice with those in patient brain. Thus, any strategy to enhance apoD expression may provide neuroprotection against excitotoxicity associated with neuropathogenesis. Nevertheless, as variations in the levels of apoD might influence the lipid and glucose metabolism at off-target sites, potentially leading to insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis [44], such strategy needs to be highly specific.",

            "text": "In sum, this study provides additional insights into the emerging mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective role of apoD upregulation in CNS injury. As a result of its lipid-binding properties, apoD might reverse the excitotoxicity-induced accumulation of cholesterol and potentially other lipids in neurons and most importantly their presence as free, cytosolic species, limiting their availability for deleterious reactions. In the same way, apoD limits pro-inflammatory reactions such as microglial activation and this might be related to its capacity of binding/chelating free lipids. Apart from its functions in lipid metabolism, apoD could limit the effects of acute excitotoxicity by controlling NMDAR subunit composition and intracellular Ca2+ levels (Fig. 10). Our results suggest apoD as an attractive molecule for potential targeted therapy in the treatment of excitotoxicity associated with many neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases and stroke.\n",
