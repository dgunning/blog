Nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples were obtained from the infants at the time of hospitalization for LRTI. Full clinical details, which included obtainment of a clinical history and a physical examination, were performed by one of the study staff members. The method used for obtaining and processing the NPA samples has been described elsewhere [10]. All samples were evaluated for common respiratory viruses, including RSV, influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1\u20133, and adenovirus, using a direct immunofluorescence assay (Respiratory Panel 1 Viral Screening and Identification Kit; Chemicon International). Of a total of 824 samples (326 obtained from HIV-1\u2013infected infants, 486 obtained from HIV-1\u2013uninfected infants, and 12 obtained from infants with unknown HIV-1 infection status), 196 samples were randomly selected and were stratified by HIV-1 infection status. These 824 samples were in addition to 454 samples (75, 367, and 12 obtained from HIV-1\u2013infected infants, HIV-1\u2013uninfected infants, and infants with unknown HIV-1 infection status, respectively) from which \u2a7e1 of the studied common respiratory viruses was identified. The HIV-1 infection status of the infants was determined using HIV-1 ELISAs (Axsym [Abbott] and Murex HIV 1+2 [Murex Diagnostics]) and confirmed using an HIV-1 PCR assay (HIV-1 DNA PCR, version 1.5; Roche Amplicor).",

We chose to limit the number of samples tested, as well as the period of time from which samples were selected for testing, because of the limited resources available to conduct this preliminary study, which aimed to document whether hMPV was an important pathogen among infants who are traditionally most at risk of being hospitalized for LRTI. Furthermore, we chose not to evaluate specimens that had tested positive for any of the other common respiratory viruses on the basis of the low frequency of dual-virus coinfections with hMPV and other viruses (0%\u20132%) observed in all but one of the other studies [1, 2, 4, 8]. The samples used were obtained during March through July, which is period when previous RSV epidemics had been described to occur in the community [11], as well as 2 months thereafter (August and September\u2014i.e., early spring), to reflect the possibility that the seasonality of hMPV epidemics follows that of RSV epidemics.",

The original RT-PCR assay was modified to a 1-step RT-PCR using the Titan One Tube RT-PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In brief, 10 \u03bcL of total RNA was added to a 40-\u03bcL reaction mixture, in accordance with manufacturer's instructions. The reverse transcription procedure was performed at 50\u00b0C for 30 min, and PCR was performed as described elsewhere [12]. The resulting amplicons were purified from agarose gels using the Gene Clean kit (Bio 101). Both strands were sequenced using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) with the ABI 310 automated sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems). The partial nucleotide sequences of the F gene were aligned using CLUSTAL \u00d7 1.81, with the published F nucleotide sequence obtained from The Netherlands (isolate HMPV001; GenBank accession no. AF371337). All samples were tested at the Respiratory and Meningeal Pathogens Research Unit in Johannesburg, South Africa.",

The relatively lower prevalence of hMPV among HIV-1\u2013infected infants, compared with HIV-1\u2013uninfected infants, was most likely related to the greater importance of other respiratory pathogens among HIV-1\u2013infected infants, including bacteria (\u2a7e15% of cases) and P. jiroveci (\u223c45% of cases) [9, 15]. In a previous study, we showed that, despite RSV (5.3% vs. 18.1%), influenza virus (5.4% vs. 11.8%), and parainfluenza viruses (4.2% vs. 7.9%) being proportionally less commonly isolated among HIV-1\u2013infected infants than among HIV-1\u2013uninfected infants who had been hospitalized for severe LRTI, the relative risk of hospitalization for LRTI associated with these viruses was \u223c2\u20138-fold greater among HIV-1\u2013infected infants [10]. The design of this study was suboptimal to estimate the relative risk of hospitalization for hMPV-associated LRTI between HIV-1\u2013infected and HIV-1\u2013uninfected infants. Nevertheless, on the basis of the estimate that the prevalence of HIV-1 infection in the study cohort was \u223c6% [16], it was extrapolated that, like other common respiratory viruses [10], hMPV was isolated from a lower proportion of HIV-1\u2013infected infants hospitalized for LRTI. The population risk of hospitalization for hMPV-associated LRTI was, however, 2.9-fold (95% CI, 1.6\u20135.1-fold) greater among HIV-1\u2013infected infants than among HIV-1\u2013uninfected infants, as determined on the basis of calculation methods described elsewhere [10].",

Furthermore, none of the samples that had tested positive for other respiratory viruses were further tested for hMPV. This may have resulted in a lowering of the relative importance of hMPV in relation to the other viruses. Samples were also not evaluated for other potential respiratory viral pathogens, such as rhinovirus, enterovirus, and coronavirus. Concurrent viral infections have been reported among 2 (16.7%) of 12 children with hMPV-associated acute respiratory tract infections, as well as among 70% of children requiring mechanical ventilation for RSV-associated bronchiolitis [8, 17]. Furthermore, among HIV-1\u2013infected children, P. jiroveci is often found, but it was not sought for the 3 HIV-1\u2013infected children in whom hMPV was identified. A high rate (42%) of concurrent PCP and respiratory viral infection among children with LRTI was previously documented in this population [15]; this may explain the trend toward a longer duration of hospitalization among the HIV-1\u2013infected infants in this study, compared with HIV-1\u2013uninfected infants with hMPV infection.",

A recent study using the same PCR technique as was used in our study, however, suggested that, on its own, RT-PCR may be adequate for identification of hMPV, even in the absence of viral culture [17]. Although an additional limitation of our study was the absence of a control group of healthy infants to exclude isolation of hMPV as coincidental in the studied infants, a more recent study [17] (in addition to the earliest report on hMPV [1]) has shown that hMPV infection/colonization is absent among infants without respiratory symptoms.",

Furthermore, 4 (28.6%) of 14 infants had an axillary temperature of \u2a7e37.5\u00b0C at the time of presentation, and 4 (66.7%) of the 6 infants examined had C-reactive protein levels of \u2a7e40 mg/dL. In the absence of any bacterial growth on blood cultures, these findings suggest either that hMPV may be associated with a severe inflammatory response, including extensive lung parenchymal involvement, or that there may have been concurrent, unrecognized bacterial coinfections in these infants that may have contributed to the radiological and laboratory features that were observed. However, the findings in our study are in contrast with those in a study from Hong Kong, where the majority of children with hMPV infection were pyrexial (mean temperature, 39.2\u00b0C), and none had lobar consolidation visible on chest radiographs [5]. However, the children with hMPV infection in the Hong Kong study were much older (mean age, 31.7 months) than were those in our study [5]. The C-reactive protein levels and WBC counts observed among selected infants in our study also differed from those observed among Finnish children, in whom the mean C-reactive protein level was 9 mg/L and the mean WBC count was 9.5 \u00d7 109 cells/L [7]. This difference in C-reactive protein levels and WBC counts in our study may have been because these values were determined mainly in infants with severe disease, as evidenced by the longer duration of hospitalization among the infants for whom these measurements were made; in the Finland study, these tests were performed for children with clinically milder disease [7]. However, the duration of hospitalization in our study (median, 2.0 days) was similar to that observed among Finnish children (mean \u00b0 SD, 2.5 \u00b0 1.6 days) [7].",

Therefore, additional studies are warranted to clarify the importance of the identified risk factors as underlying conditions for severe RSV disease among infants.
