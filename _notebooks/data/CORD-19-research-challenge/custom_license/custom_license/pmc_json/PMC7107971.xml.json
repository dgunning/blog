Children aged 3 months to 15 years who were admitted to the Department of Pediatrics of Turku University Hospital (Turku, Finland) from 1 September 2000 through 31 May 2002 for acute expiratory wheezing have been observed and described elsewhere [17, 26]. At admission to the hospital, NPAs for viral diagnosis were obtained by a standard procedure [26]. Blood samples were collected at hospital admission and 2\u2013 3 weeks after hospital discharge, and the paired serum samples were stored at \u2212 20\u00b0 C. Of the 259 children who were included in the previous virus etiology study, comprising PCR studies of NPAs for 16 viruses (adenovirus; HBoV; coronaviruses 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1; enteroviruses; rhinoviruses; influenza A and B viruses; human metapneumovirus; parainfluenza virus 1\u2013 4; and respiratory syncytial virus), 49 (19%) of 259 were shown to be HBoV positive by PCR [17]. Paired serum samples from these 49 HBoV-positive children (mean age, 2.1 years; range, 5 months to 11 years) were available for the present study. Paired serum samples from 68 randomly selected wheezing children (mean age, 2.5 years; range, 5 months to 12 years) who had NPAs with HBoV-negative PCR results in the same study were included as control subjects. The duration of symptoms (e.g., cough) prior to hospital admission was a mean of 4.8 days (range, 0\u2013 28 days) and the hospitalization time was a mean of 28.6 h (range, 0\u2013 138 h), based on data available for 112 children. The study was approved by the Ethics Committees of Turku University Hospital (Turku, Finland) and Helsinki University Hospital (Helsinki, Finland).",

When the cultures reached an OD600 of 0.5, they were induced for 3 h with 0.4 mM isopropyl \u03b2 -D-thiogalactoside. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (10 min at 10,000 g at room temperature), resuspended in 25 mL of PBS, and lysed by sonication on ice.

Indeed, both VP2 and the VP1u region have been successfully used in the diagnosis of B19 infections [30, 36\u2013 38]. One possible reason for the dissimilarity between the 2 viruses might be a difference in the location of VP1u within the capsid [34, 39, 40], which could affect its accessibility to host immunity. With the HBoV VP1u immunoblot assay, the overall seroprevalence rate was as low as 7%, with no correlation with HBoV-positive NPAs by PCR.

However, this cannot be regarded as a general HBoV seroprevalence in this age group because of the fact that all of our children had been enrolled on the basis of their respiratory symptoms. According to PCR, acute HBoV infection has been shown to be most prevalent in children aged 6 months to 3 years [9\u2013 16]. It is possible that children \u2a7d 6 months of age are protected by maternal antibodies. In our study, however, only 5 children were as young as 5\u2013 6 months of age (2 in the coinfection group and 3 in the control group), and none were HBoV seropositive. The seroprevalence seemed to increase with age, reaching a maximum of 52% among children 1\u2013 2 years of age and then decreasing to 27% among children 3\u2013 5 years of age. This decrease suggests that the denatured antigen, which is inherent to the immunoblot method, might not be recognized by the past immunity antibodies of the older children. Such a time-related conformational dependence is characteristic for the B cell immunity of the B19 virus [27\u2013 29, 41, 42]. This phenomenon, in addition to the superficial mucosal infection, could also explain why not all patients with low viral loads were IgG positive, in line with the hypothesis of virus persistence long after infection.",

            "text": "Allander et al. [17] found HBoV DNA in the NPAs of 49 (19%) of 259 wheezing children, 28 (11%) of whom had high HBoV DNA loads, and 12 (5%) of whom were infected with HBoV only. Infections associated with low virus loads were, however, prevalent and were suggested to reflect virus persistence. High viral load and viremia were noted mainly in the absence of other respiratory viruses, suggesting a causative role for HBoV in acute wheezing. In the present study, serodiagnostic findings strongly support this causality. A low viral load in the nasopharynx thus seems to be of little clinical significance. Even though the VP2 immunoblot assay used here is not intended to be the final diagnostic tool, our findings clearly show the diagnostic value of serological testing in acute HBoV infection. The diagnostic criteria for a bocavirus infection are currently unsettled. Using only HBoV-positive PCR results in NPAs as the criterion, some cases of acute HBoV infection (evidenced by viremia and/or serodiagnostic findings) would be missed. Furthermore, a number of false diagnoses would be obtained, perhaps as the result of persisting HBoV DNA or mucosal contamination. Serological testing, coupled with quantitative PCR, should be included in diagnostics, as shown here, to strengthen the causal association between HBoV and respiratory disease. With this combination of diagnostic tools, it is now possible to also evaluate other clinical manifestations possibly caused by HBoV, such as pediatric gastroenteritis [45]. Whether, and in which context and to what extent, this virus affects immunocompromised individuals, pregnant women, and elderly individuals is currently unknown. Additional knowledge of the neutralizing capacity and the longevity of HBoV immunity is also required.",

We also show that the main target for this response is the major capsid protein VP2, whereas the unique region of the minor protein, VP1u, is less immunoreactive. By measurement of HBoV-specific antibodies, it is possible to identify acute HBoV infections in small children hospitalized for severe respiratory disease. For maximum diagnostic power, both quantitative PCR and serological testing should be performed.",
