The samples collected during NMA alone demonstrate wider concentration peaks (when adjusted for the different time scales), as the nebulizer was running throughout the entire procedure, and higher particle counts but lower mass concentrations, indicative of smaller particle sizes.

            "text": "Particle number size distribution data (Figure 3) indicate that the particles generated during bronchoscopy with NMA (Figure 3A and 3C) were generally larger (geometric mean diameter [GMD], 44 nm; standard deviation [SD], 2.75) than those generated during NMA alone (Figure 3B and 3D) (GMD, 33 nm; SD, 2.61). This is consistent with the results presented in Figure 2, which showed higher mass concentrations for bronchoscopy with NMA, as larger particles contribute more to mass concentration than do smaller particles. Because the nebulized particles are composed mainly of water, their sizes are largely affected by the nebulizing conditions (such as pressure and air flow rate) and time allowed for evaporation after they are emitted from the nebulizer [30]. It is therefore possible that the different particle sizes observed during the 2 types of procedures may be due to different air flow patterns in the rooms where the procedures were performed (some bronchoscopies were performed in negative pressure ventilation rooms, unlike those used for NMA). The particle size observations may also be influenced by different locations of the patient relative to air intake/outlet in the rooms, different NMA administration techniques (mask vs mouth piece), and whether albuterol was coadministered with another medication. Particle size distribution data for the other procedures evaluated in this study showed that pouring and flushing liquid waste in the hopper did produce a few aerosolized particles of approximately 1 \u03bcm (<0.5 number/cm3); however, this peak was no longer discernible after 20 seconds, as particles most likely drifted, settled, or were carried away by convection. Changing linens also produced small amounts of particles of around 40 nm in size. Bathing patients produced a low concentration of 0.5- to 1.5-\u03bcm particles, possibly caused by the evaporation of chlorhexidine gluconate in the soap used for bathing.",

The high particle concentrations are likely related to the use of a nebulizer during these procedures, and the particles are most likely aerosolized medication that escaped from the nebulizer device. This conclusion is supported by the results of a previous study, which evaluated droplet dispersion during nebulizer treatment and found an aerosol output profile consistent with nebulizer characteristics, rather than with dissemination of droplets from patients [36]. The extent of particle generation during NMA is probably related to the type of nebulizer used, treatment length, and patient characteristics, as a high amount of variability in particle concentration was observed during the different NMA sampling episodes. Although there was no significant bacterial pathogen recovery during NMA, the high concentrations of small aerosolized particles (median of 1 \u03bcm) could potentially affect HCP who administer the treatments.",
