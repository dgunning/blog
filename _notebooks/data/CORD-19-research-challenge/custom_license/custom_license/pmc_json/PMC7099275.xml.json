This may represent a limit, given the fact that autopsies may be often necessary in these patients (especially if a clear diagnosis has not been established), and represent a high-risk procedure. The lack of written, well-known, and exercised safety procedures is considered cause of an increased risk of exposures for the workers performing the autopsy [22]. Similarly, a better attention should be given to select a small number of selected pathologists, those in charge for performing autopsies in these patients, in order to train them to work with full PPE and to safely remove them, as suggested for other HCWs [23]. Moreover, despite the fact that special autopsy suites and equipments are advocated by existing guidelines to increase the safety of autopsies [3, 18\u201321], the BSL-3 autopsy rooms were few, and the use of special devices, such as those for the reduction of aerosol production during the use of oscillating saw, was rarely reported. In some cases, as in the three facilities that reported to have a BSL-3 design for autopsy room but no specific devices and procedures, results seem inconsistent, since the availability of an equipped BSL-3 autopsy room is not enough if specific procedures are lacking. These data are more alarming in the specific setting of isolation facilities managing HIDs, where the use of special autopsy rooms and equipment is essential and may be more frequent.",
