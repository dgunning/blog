CATCH incorporates various parameters that govern hybridization (Supplementary Fig. 1b), such as sequence complementarity between probe and target, and accepts different values for each dataset (Supplementary Fig. 1c). This allows, for example, more diverse datasets to be assigned less stringent conditions than others. Assume we have a function s(d, \u03b8d) that gives a probe set for a single dataset d using hybridization parameters \u03b8d, and let S({\u03b8d}) represent the union of s(d, \u03b8d) across all datasets d where {\u03b8d} is the collection of parameters across all datasets.

These 8 viruses together reflect a range of typical viral titers in biological samples, including ones that have extremely low levels, such as ZIKV6,7. The samples encompass a range of source materials: plasma, serum, buccal swabs, urine, avian swabs, and mosquito pools. We performed capture on these libraries and sequenced them both before and after capture. To compare enrichment of viral content across sequencing runs, we downsampled raw read data from each sample to the same number of reads (200,000) before further analysis. Downsampling to correct for differences in sequencing depth, rather than the more common use of a normalized count such as reads per million, is useful for two reasons. First, it allows us to compare our ability to assemble genomes (e.g., owing to capture) in samples that were sequenced to different depths. Second, downsampling helps to correct for differences in sequencing depth in the presence of a high frequency of PCR duplicate reads (Online Methods), as observed in captured libraries. We removed duplicate reads during analyses so that we could measure enrichment of viral information (i.e., unique viral content) rather than measure an artifactual enrichment arising from PCR amplification.",

Interestingly, VALL did show limited positive enrichment of segment 6, as well as of segment 4 (H); these enrichments were lower than those of the less divergent segments.

Capture considerably increased the amount of unique LASV material detected in all 23 samples (in 4 samples, by more than 100 \u2715), and in 7 samples it enabled detection when there were no LASV reads pre-capture (Supplementary Fig. 10a, Supplementary Table 7). This in turn improved genome assembly. Whereas pre-capture we could not assemble any portion of a genome in 22 samples (in the remaining one, 2% of a genome) at this depth, following use of VALL we could assemble a partial genome in 22 of the 23 (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 10b); most were small portions of a genome, although in 7 we assembled >50% of a genome. Assembly results with VALL are comparable without downsampling (Supplementary Fig. 10c), likely because we saturate unique content with VALL even at low sequencing depths (Supplementary Fig. 7b, c).

To confirm the presence of these viruses we assembled their genomes and evaluated read depth (Supplementary Fig. 11, Supplementary Table 8). We also sequenced pre-capture samples and saw significant enrichment by capture (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Fig. 6c, d). Quantifying abundance and enrichment together provides a valuable way to discriminate viral species from other taxa (Fig. 4c), thereby helping to uncover which pathogens are present in samples with unknown infections.",

This could also be applied on other small machines such as the iSeq (Illumina) or MinION (Oxford Nanopore)40. Further, the increase in viral content enables more samples to be pooled and sequenced on a single run, increasing sample throughput and decreasing per-sample cost relative to unbiased sequencing (Supplementary Table 9).

Notably, as capture requires additional cycles of amplification, computational analyses should account for duplicate reads due to amplification; the inclusion of unique molecular identifiers41,42 could improve determination of unique fragments. Also, quantifying the sensitivity and specificity of capture with comprehensive probe sets is challenging \u2013\u2013 as it is for metagenomic sequencing more broadly \u2013\u2013 due to the need to obtain viral genomes for the hundreds of targeted species and the risk of false positives from components of sequencing and classification that are unrelated to capture (e.g., contamination in sample processing or read misclassifications). Targeted amplicon approaches may be faster and more sensitive7 for sequencing ultra low titer samples, but the suitability of these approaches is limited by genome size, sequence heterogeneity, and the need for prior knowledge of the target species1,43,44. Similarly, for molecular diagnostics of particular pathogens, many commonly used assays such as qRT-PCR and rapid antigen tests are likely to be faster and less expensive than metagenomic sequencing. Capture does increase the preparation cost and time per-sample compared to unbiased metagenomic sequencing, but this is offset by reduced sequencing costs through increased sample pooling and/or lower-depth sequencing1 (Supplementary Table 9).",

This includes many bacteria, which, like viruses, have high variation even within species48. Beyond microbes, CATCH could benefit studies in other areas that use capture-based approaches, such as the detection of previously characterized fetal and tumor DNA from cell-free material49,50, in which known targets of interest may represent a small fraction of all material and for which it may be useful to rapidly design new probe sets for enrichment as novel targets are discovered.

CATCH supports two LSH families: one under Hamming distance27 and another using the MinHash technique28,51, which has been used in metagenomic applications52,53. It detects near-duplicate candidate probes by performing approximate near neighbor search28 using a specified family and distance threshold. CATCH constructs hash tables containing the candidate probes and then queries each (in descending order of multiplicity) to find and collapse near-duplicates. Because LSH reduces the space of candidate probes, it may remove candidate probes that would otherwise be selected in steps described below, thereby increasing the size of the output probe set. Use of LSH to reduce the number of candidate probes is optional in our implementation of CATCH; we did not use it to produce the probe sets in this work. The approach of detecting near-duplicates among probes (and subsequently mapping them onto sequences, described below) bears some similarity to the use of P-clouds for clustering related oligonucleotides in order to identify diverse repetitive regions in the human genome54,55.",

To enable comparisons between pre- and post-capture results, we downsampled all raw reads to 200,000 reads using SAMtools70. We performed all analyses on downsampled data sets unless otherwise stated. We chose this number as 90% of all samples sequenced on the MiSeq (among the 30 patient and environmental samples used for validation) were sequenced to a depth of at least 200,000 reads. For those few low coverage samples for which we did not obtain >200,000 reads, we performed all analyses using all available reads unless otherwise noted (Supplementary Table 3). Downsampling normalizes sequencing depth across runs and allows us to more readily evaluate the effectiveness of capture on genome assembly (i.e., the fraction of the genome we can assemble) than an approach such as comparing viral reads per million. It also allows us to more readily compare unique content (see below). A statistic like unique viral reads per unique million reads can be distorted based on sequencing depth in the presence of a high fraction of viral PCR duplicate reads: sequencing to a lower depth can inflate the value of this statistic compared to sequencing to a higher depth.",

We aligned depleted reads to this genome as described above (with BWA using the \u2018align_and_plot_coverage\u2019 function of viral-ngs and the following parameters: \u2018-m 50000 --excludeDuplicates --aligner_options \u201c-k 12 -B 2 -O 3\u201d --minScoreToFilter 60\u2019).

To account for laboratory contaminants we also ran kraken on water controls; we first merged all water controls together, and classified reads as described above. We evaluated the presence and enrichment of viral and other taxa using the cumulative species-level counts, as above. To do so we calculated two measures: abundance, which was calculated by dividing pre-capture read counts for each species by counts in pooled water controls, and enrichment, which was calculated by dividing post-capture read counts for each species by pre-capture read counts in the same sample. For our uncharacterized mosquito pools and human plasma samples from Nigeria and Sierra Leone, after capture with VALL we searched for viral species with more than 10 matched reads and a read count greater than 2-fold higher than in the pooled water control after capture with VALL. For each virus identified we assembled viral genomes and calculated per-base read depth as described above (Supplementary Fig. 11, Supplementary Table 8). When producing coverage plots, we calculated per-base read depth as described above for known samples, except we removed supplementary alignments before calculating depth to remove artificial chimeras.",

            "text": "Figure 1: (a) Sketch of CATCH\u2019s approach to probe design, shown with three datasets (typically, each is a taxon). For each dataset d, CATCH generates candidate probes by tiling across input genomes and, optionally, reduces the number of them using locality-sensitive hashing. Then, it determines a profile of where each candidate probe will hybridize (the genomes and regions within them) under a model with parameters \u03b8d (see Supplementary Fig. 1b for details). Using these coverage profiles, it approximates the smallest collection of probes that fully captures all input genomes (described in text as s(d, \u03b8d)). Given a constraint on the total number of probes (N) and a loss function over \u03b8d, it searches for optimal \u03b8d for all d. (b) Number of probes required to fully capture increasing numbers of HCV genomes. Approaches shown are simple tiling (gray), a clustering-based approach at two levels of stringency (red), and CATCH with three choices of parameter values specifying varying levels of stringency (blue). See Supplementary Note 2 for details regarding parameter choices. Previous approaches for targeting viral diversity use clustering in probe set design. Shaded regions around each line are 95% pointwise confidence bands calculated across randomly sampled input genomes. (c) Number of probes designed by CATCH for each dataset (of 296 datasets in total) among all 349,998 probes in the VALL probe set. Species incorporated in our sample testing are labeled. (d) Values of the two parameters selected by CATCH for each dataset in the design of VALL: number of mismatches to tolerate in hybridization and length of the target fragment (in nt) on each side of the hybridized region assumed to be captured along with the hybridized region (cover extension). The label and size of each bubble indicate the number of datasets that were assigned a particular combination of values. Species included in our sample testing are labeled in black, and outlier species not included in our testing are in gray. In general, more diverse viruses (e.g., HCV and HIV-1) are assigned more relaxed parameter values (here, high values) than less diverse viruses, but still require a relatively large number of probes in the design to cover known diversity (see (c)).

Each curve represents one of the 31 viral genomes sequenced here (one sample contained two known viruses). At each position across a genome, the post-capture read depth is divided by the pre-capture depth, and the plotted curve is the empirical cumulative distribution of the log of these fold-change values. A curve that rises fully to the right of the black vertical line illustrates enrichment throughout the entirety of a genome; the more vertical a curve, the more uniform the enrichment. Read depth across viral genomes DENV-SM3 (purple) and DENV-SM5 (green) are shown in more detail in (b). (b) Read depth throughout a genome of DENV in two samples. DENV-SM3 (left) has few informative reads before capture and does not produce a genome assembly, but does following capture. DENV-SM5 (right) does yield a genome assembly before capture, and depth increases following capture. (c) Percent of each viral genome unambiguously assembled in the 30 samples, which had 8 known viral infections across them. Shown before capture (orange), after capture with VWAFR (light blue), and after capture with VALL (dark blue). Red bars below samples indicate ones in which we could not assemble any contig before capture but, following capture, were able to assemble at least a partial genome (>50%). (d) Left: Number of reads detected for each species across the 30 samples with known viral infections, before and after capture with VALL. Reads in each sample were downsampled to 200,000 reads.

Homo sapiens matches in samples from humans are shown in black. Right: Abundance of each detected species before capture and fold-change upon capture with VALL for these samples.

Label to the right of each line indicates amount of background material. (b) Relation between probe-target identity and enrichment in read depth, as seen after capture with VALL and with VWAFR on an influenza A virus sample of subtype H4N4 (IAV-SM5). Each point represents a window in the IAV genome. Identity between the probe and assembled H4N4 sequence is a measure of identity between the sequence in that window and the top 25% of probe sequences that map to it (see Online Methods for details). Fold-change in depth is averaged over the window. No sequences of segment 6 (N) of the N4 subtypes were included in the design of VALL or VWAFR.

RNA of 2, 4, 6, and 8 viral species were spiked into extracted RNA from healthy human plasma and then captured with VALL and VWAFR.
