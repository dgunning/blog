VLPs are non-replicating as well as noninfectious because they do not contain viral genetic materials. Viral structural proteins such as envelope viral glycoproteins and capsid core proteins can be expressed and self-assembled into a particulate morphology of VLPs in cell cultures in vitro. VLPs can be produced in bacteria, mammalian cell lines, insect cell lines, yeast, and plant cells [17]. VLPs produced by recombinant baculovirus \u2013 derived constructs exhibited higher and broader immune responses compared to those by mammalian \u2013 expressed VLP vaccines [18]. It is possible that residual baculoviruses in VLP preparations activates innate immune response at the site of inoculation. VLPs provide an immunogenic platform effectively eliciting T cell and B cell immune responses due to repetitive and high density of viral proteins displayed on the surfaces of VLPs [19,20].\n",

The rBV expression system produced seasonal trivalent VLP vaccines derived from influenza A virus such as A/New Caledonia/20/1999 H1N1, A/New York/55/2004 H3N2, and influenza B virus B/Shanghai/367/2002 were able to elicit substantial levels of hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers against homologous and heterologous virus challenge in mouse and ferret models [53] (Table 1). In this study, mice were immunized with 3 \u00b5g, 6 \u00b5g, or 12 \u00b5g of VLP and ferrets immunized with 15 \u00b5g, 3 \u00b5g, or 0.6 \u00b5g [53]. Trivalent VLP vaccines were found to elicit higher levels of influenza-specific CD8+ T cell responses in mice than those with commercial egg-derived trivalent-inactivated vaccine (TIV). H1N1 or H3N2 influenza VLPs vaccinations provided higher vaccine efficacies against homologous or heterologous virus challenge infections compared to that against heterosubtypic influenza virus, showing less body weight loss (0\u201312%) in animal models after challenge with homologous or heterologous virus [25,50\u201352,54\u201356]. These results indicate that the efficacies of influenza VLP vaccines are encouraging in preclinical studies as an alternative vaccine platform. However, protective efficacies vary with diverse VLP vaccines containing different antigenic components and contents. Most efficacy studies were reported in in-bred mouse models, which might not predict what will happen in humans after vaccination. Influenza VLP vaccines need to be better characterized, tested in out-bred, more relevant animal models, and developed for improved cross-protective immunity for consideration of future vaccines.",

            "text": "An influenza pandemic is an outbreak of a novel influenza virus that can spread worldwide. During the 2009 influenza pandemic, we observed significant shortages and delays of egg-based vaccines in the global supply [5]. Technology of non-replicating VLPs represents an alternative option since it is immunogenic, safe, and independent of egg supplies. Previous studies reported influenza VLPs containing the HA, NA, and M2 surface proteins from highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses: A/Chicken/FPV/Rostock/1934 (H7N1) and A/Thailand/KAN-1/04 (H5N1), inducing high titers of neutralizing antibodies in mice [57]. Influenza 2009 H1N1 VLPs and H5N1 VLPs generated by using the rBV expression system-induced encouraging protective immunity in mice and ferrets [54,58,59] (Tables 1 and 2). H7 HA VLPs assembled with HA of wild-type (HA-WT) or HA transmembrane (TM) domain replaced by that from H3N2 subtype (HA-TM) were generated [60]. H7 VLPs-TM induced better protection against homologous and heterologous H7N9 viruses challenge, as observed with less weight loss and higher survival rates compared to H7 VLPs-WT [60]. A bivalent heterologous DNA and VLP prime-boost vaccine was reported to provide protection against H1, H5, H9, and H3 and H7 viruses [61]. Mice were primed with DNA plasmid twice at weeks 0 and 3 and boosted with VLP. The immune sera from vaccinated mice were able to neutralize homologous, heterologous (H5, H7) and heterosubtypic H1 virus after passive transfer [61]. Irina Tretyakova and her colleague reported a quadrivalent pseudotype influenza VLP vaccine containing four different types of HA (H5N1, H7N9, H9N2, and H10N8) proteins, NA and bovine immunodeficiency virus gag protein (B gag) as an alternative to M1 matrix protein in insect cells [62] (Table 2). Electron microscopic observation results demonstrated that average sizes of the B gag core protein assembled VLPs are in a range of 150 nm to 200 nm, which was larger than the influenza virus M1 core protein assembled VLPs. These results indicate that vaccine efficacies from avian influenza VLPs are encouraging. B gag core protein assembled VLPs might incorporate more spike antigens than the M1 assembled VLPs.",

            "text": "Influenza virus surface antigenic proteins HA and NA change over time and result in generating novel viruses that are antigenically different to become new HA and/or new HA and NA proteins in influenza viruses. New research efforts to develop universal influenza VLPs containing HA, NA, and M2 proteins are going on for broader immunity.M2e as an extracellular domain of M2 is conserved among influenza A viruses and has been used for cross-protective antigenic target [63]. The cross-protective efficacy was observed after vaccination of mice with M2e5x VLP vaccines containing heterologous tandem M2e repeats (M2e5x) derived from human, swine, and avian influenza viruses [63]. This heterologous tandem M2e5x repeat construct contains multiple M2e conserved epitopes to increase the density of M2e epitopes. A comparative study of vaccine efficacy has been conducted in mice between M2e5x VLP and wild-type M2 expressed VLP. This study demonstrated that M2e5x VLP immunization induced 100% protection against A/California/4/2009 (H1N1), A/PR/8/34 (H1N1), A/Philippines/2/82 (H3N2), and A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1). However, wild-type M2 VLP-vaccinated mice showed a significant loss in body weight with a substantial delay in recovering body weight [64] (Table 2). M2e5x VLP vaccination could induce long-lasting cross-protection against A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and reassortant A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) virus by passively transferring immune sera from vaccinated mice to the na\u00efve mice [64]. Another experimental data demonstrated that M2e5x VLP vaccine has the ability to show more cross-protective efficacy in BALB/c mice compared to C57BL/6 mice [63,65], suggesting that immunogenicity and efficacy are dependent on host strains. The efficacy of cross-protection by M2e VLP immunity is mediated by weak non-neutralizing immune responses [66\u201368]. Supplemented HA-based influenza vaccination with M2e5x VLP vaccines could significantly enhance cross-protection in mice, chicken, and ferret [66,69,70]. These results indicate that higher vaccine efficacy or cross-protection induced by M2e VLPs can be induced by supplemented influenza vaccination.",

RSV F and G glycoproteins contain B cell and T cell epitopes to generate a protective-immune response in hosts after natural infection [90\u201392]. Although RSV contains another surface glycoprotein, SH glycoprotein, but naturally it is weakly immunogenic [93]. RSV VLP vaccines have been generated by expressing RSV G or F glycoproteins. As seen in Figure 1(b) and Table 3, Newcastle diseases virus (NDV) VLPs containing the ectodomain of RSV G and F proteins have been generated. Recombinant chimeric RSV-NDV constructs of RSV G and F protein fused to the cytoplasmic tail (CT) and the transmembrane (TM) domain of NDV hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and F protein were generated to produce RSV VLP vaccines based on NDV structural proteins [94,95]. Interaction between the TM-CT of chimeric RSV-NDV glycoproteins and NDV \u2013 nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix M protein was necessary for efficient production of chimeric RSV-NDV VLP vaccines in avian cells by DNA transfection [95,96].

Vaccination of mice with combined RSV F VLP F + G VLP induced Th1 CD8 T cell responses and provided additive protection and prevented lung immunopathology after challenge but RSV G alone VLP vaccination resulted in substantial lung histopathology after RSV challenge [111]. VLP vaccine containing tandem repetitive RSV G fragment was able to provide recall B cell responses and protection against lung viral replication after RSV challenge [105]. Also, immunization with combined RSV VLP vaccines (F + G) with F DNA (FFG VLP) induced Th1-biased IgG2a isotype antibody responses to RSV F and more effective in preventing lung histopathogloy after RSV challenge than immunity induced by live RSV prior infection [112]. In addition, combined FFG VLP vaccination induced higher ratios of CD11c+ versus CD11b+ and IFN-\u03b3+ CD8 versus CD4 T cells in addition to effective clearing lung viral loads [113]. Interestingly, prime immunization of mice with RSV F VLP vaccine induced Th1-biased immune response, preventing the induction of lung histopathology due to subsequent FI-RSV vaccination [114].

A recent study demonstrated that avian cell-derived VLP vaccines containing ectodomains of RSV G and pre-F/F proteins were highly effective in inducing higher levels of RSV neutralizing antibodies even in the presence of prior RSV infection in a mouse model compared to the RSV re-infected mice [116]. Cotton rats are known to be more permissive to RSV infection and thus considered to be a preferred animal model than mice for RSV pathogenesis and vaccine efficacy studies. VLP vaccines containing two chimeric RSV ectodomain glycoproteins (chimeric pre-fusion F/F and H/G) were shown to confer protection against RSV replication upon RSV challenge in cotton rats [99].

The F protein is required for virus assembly, fusion, and entry and the primary target of neutralizing antibodies [121,122]. HMPV-VLP was produced by co-expression of F and G proteins along with the core matrix protein M through the mammalian cell-based DNA transfection [123]. This study has also revealed some new findings about HMPV VLP assembly, that HMPV-G protein itself can independently facilitate the formation of VLP and additionally, that expression of HMPV-F protein on the surface of VLP is largely dependent on its association with the HMPV-G [123]. Another group of researchers has produced HMPV VLP by using retrovirus-derived Gag core protein [13]. Murine leukemia virus Gag protein was used as a core particle to generate HMPV VLPs containing HMPV- G and F glycoproteins from either lineage A or B [118]. HMPV VLPs have been also generated by expressing viral proteins matrix (M) and F proteins in suspension-adapted human embryonic kidney epithelial (293-F) cells through mammalian cell-based expression system [14]. In this study, full-length M and F viral protein sequences were derived from pathogenic clinical HMPV (genotype A2) isolates TN/94-49 and TN/92-4, respectively.

H1N1 VLP vaccine was safe and well tolerated in 4500 healthy adults at 18\u201364 ages after vaccination with VLP vaccines (5-, 15-, or 45-\u03bcg HA dose) [125]. The low dose (5 \u03bcg of HA) HA VLP vaccine was found to be immunogenic and safe after vaccination. The local adverse events were observed in the moderate (15-\u03bcg HA) or high dose (45-\u03bcg HA) groups. The low dose (5 \u03bcg of HA) subjects or placebo group did not display local and serious adverse events after vaccination. Notably, in the follow up clinical studies, 82-92% of all influenza VLP vaccinated subjects were observed to have sero-protective antibody levels (\u226540 HAI titer) after boost [125]. Another phase I/II dose dependent clinical trial approved by Food and Drug administration was conducted in healthy adults to determine the efficacy of rBV/insect cell-derived A/Indonesia/05/2005 (H5N1) VLP vaccines [126]. In this clinical study, different doses of H5 HA (15, 45, or 90 \u03bcg of HA) were tested and found to induce functional antibodies, preferentially recognizing the oligomeric form of hemagglutinin [126].

There were no serious local or systemic adverse events, and only a single subject was discontinued due to an adverse event. An additional clinical study on avian influenza VLP vaccines, unadjuvanted H7N9 VLPs vaccine exhibited poor antibody responses [80].

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase I clinical trial was performed among 18\u201360 years old healthy adults at the McGill University Health Center to assess the efficacy of plant cells derived, alum-adjuvanted A/Indonesia/5/05 H5N1 VLP by intramuscular immunization with 5, 10, or 20 \u00b5g vaccine dose [128].

Influenza matrix protein (M1) was used as a core protein. Influenza VLPs are generated by insect/rBV system, mammalian cells or plant \u2013 derived. Plant-derived VLPs are produced in Nicotiana benthamiana infiltrated in batches with an Agrobacterium inoculum containing influenza antigen expression cassette. (b) RSV VLPs and nanoparticle by insect/rBV system. VLPs expressing RSV fusion protein (F) (B-1), RSV glycoprotein (G) (B-2) or both F and G (B-3) on influenza M1 core protein. RSV F nanoparticle (B-4) extracted and purified from insect cell membranes composed of multiple RSV F oligomers arranged in the form of rosettes. (c) HMPV VLPs: HMPV VLPs derived from retroviral core particles are generated in human embryonic kidney epithelial (293-f) cells by expressing fusion protein (F) (C-1), glycoprotein (G) (C-2) or both F and G (C-3) proteins.",
