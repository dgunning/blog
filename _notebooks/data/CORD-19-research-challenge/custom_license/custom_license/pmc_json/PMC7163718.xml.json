            "text": "The development and application of magnetic beads (MBs) in separation and detection methodologies has attracted strong interest in the last years. This is mainly due to the versatility, high surface area, chemical and physical stability, low toxicity and high biocompatibility exhibited by MBs 1. Their size, similar to that of molecules in nature, range from nm to a few \u00b5m, and the particles\u2010linked molecules can quickly agglomerate and be separated from a matrix or resuspended in an appropriate working medium without retaining any residual magnetism as a consequence of a change in an external magnetic force 2, 3.",

            "text": "MBs consist of a paramagnetic or superparamagnetic core surrounded by a polymeric outer layer suitable for the immobilization of biomolecules 4. The magnetic core is readily available in different iron oxide forms, among which magnetite (Fe3O4) and maghemite (\u03b3\u2010Fe2O3, ferrimagnetic) stand out since their compatibility has been proven in bio\u2010labelling and bio\u2010separation 3, 5, 6. The development of coatings for the magnetic core of MBs was necessary to address their limitations including (a) high surface energies which lead to aggregation, (b) high chemical activity leading to their oxidation, loss of magnetic properties and dispersibility when exposed to air, and (c) biodegradation with subsequent changes in magnetic properties. Consequently, protective shells, mainly composed of agarose, cellulose, silica, silicone, porous glass, mica or polystyrene 7, were developed to protect and preserve the stability of iron oxide MBs. These shells also allowed further functionalization, thus promoting MBs performance as recognition elements in sensing and (bio)chemical arrays 3. Moreover, nowadays there are commercially available MBs modified with biomolecules that allow their use in different types of bioassays. So, MBs functionalized with: (a) streptavidin suitable for capturing biotinylated nucleic acids, aptamers, peptides, proteins, etc.; (b) protein A (protA) or protein G (protG), which specifically bind antibodies; (c) oligonucleotides; or (d) affinity ligands for specific capture of tagged recombinant proteins, etc. 7 can be purchased from different companies. MBs modification has resulted in important practical advantages from an analytical point of view, including (a) shorter reaction times between dissolved species and biomolecules immobilized on the surface of the beads which is also favoured by the easy dispersion of MBs into solution with only gentle shaking, (b) readily miniaturization of the assay system by using MBs as a mobile solid phase, (c) reduction of the required volumes of reagents and produced waste, and (d) obtaining lower detection limits with shorter assay times 1.",

Bioterrorism agents are pathogenic organisms (bacteria, viruses) or biological toxins used to produce death and disease in humans, animals or plants for terrorist purposes. Although these agents are typically microorganisms found in nature, they can be modified to increase their virulence, to make them resistant to current antibiotics or vaccines, or to enhance the ability of these agents to be disseminated throughout the environment. While any germ, bacteria or virus could potentially be utilized by terrorists, there are a number of biological agents that have been recognized as being more likely to be used. This is due to their availability to terrorists and the ease by which these agents can be disseminated. Table 1 lists the main biological warfare agents (BWAs) together with the diseases they cause. The presence of microorganisms in food is also a natural and unavoidable occurrence. Cooking generally destroys most harmful bacteria, but undercooked foods, processed ready\u2010to\u2010eat foods, and minimally processed foods can contain harmful bacteria that are serious health threats.1\n",

Biosensors also offer the possibility of continuous and real\u2010time monitoring of the environment for the presence of infectious agents to allow timely implementation of preventive and protective measurements. In fact, the majority of existing technologies for detecting biological agents rely on either antibodies as the recognition molecules, which bind with a surface feature of the BWA, or on the recognition of a nucleic acid sequence known to be found in the BWA being tested.

The obtained results indicate that these convenient and sensitive methodologies offer great promise for decentralized environmental applications.

However, to our knowledge, these beads have never been used again in the development of electrochemical immunosensors.

The developed sensor that made use of a tyrosinase\u2010modified electrode was applied to the analysis of pure culture and poultry samples.

There are not so many examples on magnetic genosensors, although interesting approaches have also been developed in this field, where high sensitivities are obtained through different amplification systems, such as PCR or enzymatic signal amplification. Sensitivity and specificity can be improved in a high extent using magnetoimmuno\u2010PCR approaches, although very few examples have been described based on this innovative and combined new methodology. Future prospects should be focused on the extension of these magnetobioassays to develop highly demanded easy\u2010to\u2010use miniaturized and multiplexed bio\u2010platforms for the automated detection of multiple biohazard and/or bioterrorism agents on one shot. In this regard, combination of MBs\u2010based bioassays with microfluidic devices should facilitate implementing this kind of advanced bio\u2010platforms for the direct decentralized detection and with a short time from sample acquisition to readout. Another important challenge for analytical chemists is to validate the developed devices with real environmental, food and clinical samples. Moreover, integration of the biosensing platforms in the clothing of risk people, such as soldiers, constitutes also an exciting new field of work involving multidisciplinary strategies and economical interests.",
