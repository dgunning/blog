Only recently can we propagate hepatitis C virus from infected serum in non\u2010cancerous host cells. An emphasis will be put on the generation of the host \u201chepatocyte\u2010like cells (HLCs)\u201d. Mesenchymal stem cells are served as the precursors for induced pluripotent stem cells, which in turn, are served as immediate precursors for HLCs. The outcomes of these protocols can provide a ground work for not only the study of hepatocyte\u2010pathogen interactions, but also carcinogenesis, pharmacological and immunological applications of HLCs.",

            "text": "The human primary hepatocytes are ideal natural host cells for liver\u2010targeting pathogens such as hepatitis B (Kaneko et al., 2016; Lindenbach & Rice, 2005), hepatitis C (Sa\u2010Ngiamsuntorn et al., 2016) malarial parasite (Ng et al., 2015) and dengue viruses (Lang, Vera, Cheng, & Tang, 2016). The difficulty in obtaining these cells and their limited life span restricted the study of long term host\u2010pathogen interactions and xenobiotic metabolism. Hepatitis C virus is a single positive\u2010stranded RNA virus belonged to the genus of Hepacivirus and Flaviviridae family (Simmonds et al., 2005). Chronic HCV infection led to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (Chisari, 2005). An estimated 130\u2010150 million people globally have chronic HCV infection and there is no effective vaccine to protect against HCV. Recently, the treatment of HCV using direct\u2010acting antivirals (DAA) drugs such as sofosbuvir and simeprevir could eradicate HCV infection. However, several DAA drugs resistance have been reported (Imhof & Simmonds, 2011; Jazwinski & Muir, 2011). The development of effective HCV culture models is critical for designing efficacious anti\u2010HCV strategies. The studies on HCV life cycle and anti\u2010HCV drugs relied on human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines such as Huh7 and their derivative clones. Only HCV genotype 2a (JFH\u20101) could be propagated from Huh7 derived cells (Catanese & Dorner, 2015; Wakita et al., 2005). The application of hepatocellular carcinoma cells as a host for HCV could not fully mimic primary human hepatocytes. The genotype and phonotype of cancer cell are abnormal. Huh7 cells also lose their contact inhibition dissimilar to the primary hepatocytes which mostly present in quiescent stage. Most hepatocellular carcinoma cells usually lack several liver enzymes e.g., CYP450s, other phase I, II, and drug transporters that make them inadequate for the anti\u2010HCV drug screening.",

These cells actively entered cellular division and can be differentiated into functional hepatocyte\u2010like cell (HLCs) (Chun, Byun, & Lee, 2011) and other lineages. The applications of HLCs derived from either iPSCs or embryonic stem cells as natural hosts for HCV were recently reported (Schwartz et al., 2012; Si\u2010Tayeb et al., 2012). These differentiated cells expressed essential liver functions and achieved mature hepatocytes. HLCs also expressed known HCV host receptors involved in HCV entry (Claudin\u20101, Occludin, SR\u2010BI, CD81) and supported complete life cycle of classical HCV genotype 2a up to 30 days (Sa\u2010Ngiamsuntorn et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2012). HLCs were promptly taken as HCV hosts. The infected cells could host full viral life cycle after the transfection/infection with HCVcc and HCVser. HLCs could sustain the replication of not only JFH\u20101 HCV but various wild\u2010type HCV derived from patients\u2019 sera.",

            "text": "This unit describes overall procedures for generation of hepatocyte\u2010like cell as a natural host hepatitis c virus production and drug metabolism. The unit begins with a Basic Protocol 1, which explains procedures for isolation human mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) from aspirated bone marrow. Basic Protocol 2 describes the further maintenance and culture of isolated MSCs. Lentiviral particles that carry the reprogramming factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c\u2010MYC are produced using plasmid co\u2010transfection into HEK293T described in a Basic Protocol 3). To generate the iPSCs, MSCs are used as precursor cells for cellular reprogramming following the Basic Protocol 4. The iPSCS are characterized by various method such as alkaline phosphatase staining, immunofluorescent staining and pluripotent genes expression using reverse transcription PCR. Series of iPSCs characterization method are described in the Basic Protocol 5. Basic Protocol 6 describes hepatic induction of iPSCs to functional hepatocyte\u2010like cell. Basic Protocol 7 describes the characterization of the differentiated cells using the following methods: Periodic acid\u2010Schiff staining of glycogen, hepatocyte\u2010selective gene expressions by real\u2010time qPCR, CYP450s activities by luciferase\u2010based assay and cellular hepatitis C receptors on HLCs by immunofluorescent staining. Basic Protocol 8 and 9 describe the applications of HLCs as a host for HCV infection and replication. Basic Protocol 10 demonstrates the infectivity titer of either HCVcc or HCVser in HLCs. At the moment, only HLCs can serve as host cells for wild\u2010type HCV (HCVser).",

HCV infection is the leading cause of life\u2010threatening chronic liver disease and affects \u223c3% of the world population (Gondeau et al., 2014). Current in vivo model of HCV is limited to humans and chimpanzees owing to ethical concerns, economics, and the technical boundaries of in vivo experiment (Billerbeck, de Jong, Dorner, de la Fuente, & Ploss, 2013). Different in vitro models that support the entire HCV life cycle (entry, replication, assembly, release) and the host reacting innate immune response have been demonstrated (Steinmann & Pietschmann, 2013). However, our current knowledge of HCV life cycle is largely dependent on the molecular clone JFH\u20101 (HCV genotype 2a) that replicates in a few hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines with resulting infectious particles (HCVcc) production (Saeed et al., 2015).",

Since the discovery of HCV in 1989, a major burden impeding HCV study has been the lack of robust hepatocyte culture model to grow HCV derived from patient serum (HCVser) (Saeed et al., 2015). The significant improvement has been made with the isolation of a HCV genotype 2a from Japanese patient suffering with fulminant hepatitis (JFH\u20101). The JFH\u20101 HCV together with human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, Huh7 or its derivatives brought a promising cell culture model to study the entire HCV life cycle (Wakita et al., 2005). The application of hepatocellular carcinoma as a natural HCV host could not completely mimic primary human hepatocyte. Cancer cells usually lack some specific factors necessary for the replication of HCV derived from patient serum. The newly identified factor, SEC14L2 promotes HCV infection by enhancing vitamin E\u2010mediated protection against lipid peroxidation. The exogenous expression of SEC14L2 in Huh7.5 cell line allowed HCVser to replicate in hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (Colpitts & Baumert, 2015). Even though the lacking of essential host factor for HCVser infection was solved, the impairment of various liver functional enzymes such as CYP450s and other phase I, II, and III drug metabolizing enzymes make the hepatoma cells awkwardly unfitt] for the assessment of anti\u2010HCV drug interaction and metabolism (Blight, McKeating, Marcotrigiano, & Rice, 2003).",

The iPSCs can differentiate into other cells, thus serve as a new model for drug discovery, disease modeling, and toxicity assessment (Greenbaum, 2010). Recently, several investigators reported that iPSC can develop into functional hepatocyte\u2010like cell (HLCs) that exhibited various functions associated with mature hepatocytes (Roy\u2010Chowdhury, Wang, Guha, & Roy\u2010Chowdhury, 2016). The applications of HLC derived from pluripotent stem cell as a natural host for HCV have been reported (Yoshida et al., 2011). Differentiated HLCs exhibited important liver functions and achieved closely mature hepatocytes, including \u03b1\u2010fetoprotein, albumin, phase I and phase II drug metabolizing enzymes. Importantly, HLCs also expressed known HCV host receptors involved in HCV entry (Claudin\u20101, Occludin, SR\u2010BI, CD81) and supported entire life cycle of HCV genotype 2a up to 21 d (Wu et al., 2012). Nonetheless, the maturity, homogeneity and long\u2010term stability of these HLCs have not been revealed. The HLCs not only carried less CYP450 expression than that of the primary hepatocytes, but retained several fetal hepatocyte markers. Recently, we reported a new model of natural HCV infection using HLCs and identified the crucial factors SEC14L2, an \u03b1\u2010tocopherol transfer protein required for HCVser infection. These HLCs reproducibly express overall hepatic functions comparable to the primary human hepatocyte (Sa\u2010Ngiamsuntorn et al., 2016).",

However, the transcription should be optimized to perfect the synthesis of large HCV transcript. The authors recommend that the in vitro\u2013transcription should be monitored with gel electrophoresis to ensure RNA quality. The incidence of a large smear of RNAs in different sizes rather than a single band (with minimal smear of incomplete products) would indicate degradation or incomplete in vitro transcription. This could negatively affect intracellular HCV RNA replication after the transfection. The treatment with an RNase inhibitor and the optimization of incubation time during the transcription can improve the integrity of the HCV RNA genome. If longer RNA strand are detected, it might indicate that the plasmid DNA is not completely linearized and can interfere the transcription of the desired product. This problem can be resolved using either the linearized template DNA band prepared from agarose gel electrophoresis or another RNA template.",
