            "text": "\nAlthough incubation temperature at 37 \u00b0C is described for steps of blocking buffer, samples, and conjugate, incubation at room temperature can be a viable alternative when incubator with temperature control is not conveniently located. Please note that the overall assay reactivity (OD readings) will fluctuate along with daily changes of room temperature. However, the end results of ELISA value (S/P ratio) as normalized by an appropriate positive control analyzed on the same plate will not be affected. It is better to keep a record of room temperature for possible trouble shooting when necessary.In between and in the end of each wash cycle, it is important to tap-dry the plates on a stack of paper towel for lower nonspecific background reactivity.The commercially available ELISA plate coated with a pool of IBV strains including Massachusetts, JMK, Arkansas, Connecticut, Clone 30, D274, and D1466.This blocking step is optional because the commercial dry plate is already blocked through the production process of commercial ELISA kits. The additional blocking step may help rehydrate the coating antigens in the wells before sample incubation step and subsequently enhance assay performance.This wash step may be skipped if preferred. It is okay to add diluted samples after removal of the blocking buffer and tap dry the plate on a stack of paper towels. The presence of blocking buffer residue has limited effect on the next step for sample incubation. The components of blocking buffer including PBS buffer and BSA are also parts of the assay buffer in sample dilutions. This wash step is usually performed in our laboratory to achieve the best possible assay performance.Each sample is analyzed in two wells and the mean ELISA value is reported. When percentage coefficient of variance (%CV) is >20 % and both ELISA values are above cutpoint, the result is not reportable and the sample should be reanalyzed. When one or both of the two values is below cutpoint, the sample is considered negative. Each control samples (HPC, LPC, and NC) are analyzed in duplicate (N = 2; 4 wells for two reportable values).Pipetting volume below 10 \u03bcl may cause inter-assay variation. Any pipetting volume below 5 \u03bcl is not recommended. To reduce interday variation of dilutions, two steps of dilution may be considered when necessary such as 1:16 and then 1:100 for a final dilution at 1:1600; 1:20 and then 1:40 for a final dilution at 1:800; 1:100 and then 1:100 for a final dilution at 1:10,000.Color development is a result of HRP enzyme reaction. Laboratory environment such as room temperature may have effect on the reaction rate. It is recommended to check the color development throughout the incubation of 30 min and stop the reaction with acid to prevent overdevelopment or underdevelopment. This may not be easy for the first few runs but not that hard after some experience. It is important to keep the plate from light because the substrate is light sensitive. Wash step may be increased a few more times before the addition of TMB substrate if high background of nonspecific reactivity is observed.Cutoff point determination and system suitability controls: Cutoff point should reflect biological variations among non-infected turkeys in the field in order to differentiate the infected samples with positive results. With IFA remains as the gold standard for detection of TCoV antibody in the field, it is an appropriate approach to set up cutoff point based on IFA positive and negative populations. Some acceptable approaches are discussed below for considerations.\n",
