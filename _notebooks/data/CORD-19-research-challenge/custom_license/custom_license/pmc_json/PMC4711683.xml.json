The influenza virus is a main cause of those threats and is responsible for millions of severe cases and 250 000\u2013500 000 deaths each year.1 The scenario can be even worse during a pandemic year. The most virulent influenza, the 1918 H1N1 Spanish flu, infected approximately 5% of the world's population and killed 2%.2 The case fatality rates for the 1957 H2N2 Asian influenza, the 1968 H3N2 Hong Kong influenza, and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza were reported to be lower, with an estimated rate of 0.2% or less.3 Most alarmingly, between 1997 and 2014, several unprecedented epizootic avian influenza viruses (e.g., H5N1, H7N9, and H10N8) crossed the species barrier to cause human death. They pose an increasing threat of human-to-human transmission.4,5 These infections in humans are accompanied by an aggressive pro-inflammatory response and insufficient control of an anti-inflammatory response, a combination of events called \u2018cytokine storm'.",

In mild infection, the host has a limited or moderate resistance, so the disrupted homeostasis is restored rapidly. However, for infections caused by the 1918 H1N1 or the H5N1 influenzas virus, the resistance became hyperactive, resulting in an excessive inflammatory reaction known as the cytokine storm phenomenon.6 Several experimental studies and clinical trials suggested that cytokine storm correlated directly with tissue injury and an unfavorable prognosis of severe influenza.7 However, our understanding of the mechanism that promotes a cytokine storm remains limited. In this review, we focus on the potential mechanisms responsible for severe influenza-induced cytokine storm and the therapeutic strategies that might be used to improve the clinical prognosis of these infections.",

At the same time, regenerative processes and resolution of the damage are initiated. In most cases, function can be completely restored by this reparative process.12 However, for severe inflammation associated with cytokine storm, more serious pathological changes are observed, such as diffuse alveolar damage, hyaline membrane formation, fibrin exudates, and fibrotic healing.10 These are signs of severe capillary damage, immunopathologic injury, and persistent organ dysfunction.10 Moreover, the severe inflammatory cytokines/chemokines can spill over into the circulation and result in systemic cytokine storms, which are responsible for multi-organ dysfunction.7",

The interferon family has a critical role in the innate immune response to viruses.18 A number of proteins with antiviral or immunomodulatory properties are produced once the IFN signaling pathway is activated.18 Although overproduction of IFN in the early stage of infection likely leads to irreversible lung damage in H5N1-infected mice, the IFN signaling pathway may also be important in restricting the dissemination of H5N1 viruses.18,19 TNF-\u03b1 is a key cytokine in cytokine storm and is likely to account for the escalation in severity.12 However, TNF receptor\u2212/\u2212 mice, or mice treated with anti-TNF-antibodies, have no changes in survival when compared with controls following a challenge with the H5N1 virus.12 IL-1 and IL-6 are the main pro-inflammatory cytokines released by hosts during viral infections. IL-1 is expressed in the early stages of infection, followed by an increasing expression of IL-6.7 IL-1 receptor signaling is responsible for acute the immunopathology of tissue, and IL-1 receptor\u2212/\u2212 mice were shown to have a worse outcome after H5N1 infection.

            "text": "Unlike pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines often have specific chemotactic activities that enable monocytes and T-lymphocytes to migrate from blood vessels into the site of inflammation.9 For example, IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 are major chemotactic factors for neutrophils and monocytes, respectively. It should be noted that the levels of IL-8, interferon-induced protein (IP)-10, MCP-1, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1, and monokines induced by IFN-\u03b3 (MIG) were abnormally elevated in some fatal cases of H5N1 influenza infection and that IL-8 had the highest level among them.20 MIP-1\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit inefficient viral clearance but reduced mortality and lung damage.9 Several studies9,21 also investigated the roles of several chemokine receptors, such as the MIP-1 receptor CCR5 and the MCP-1 primary receptor CCR2, in severe influenza infections. Interestingly, CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice displayed an excessive inflammatory response and increased mortality, while CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice displayed a decreased inflammatory response and mortality but developed a significantly elevated viral load.21 This evidence partly suggests that the pathology of severe influenza is mediated by cytokine response but not viral load.",

A multivariate analysis of the 22 patients who received either hyperimmune or normal IVIG within five days of symptom onset found that hyperimmune IVIG treatment was independently responsible for the reduced mortality of infection.50 These results suggested that passive immunotherapy with hyperimmune globulin is a potential strategy for the treatment of severe influenza.",

They exert multiple immunomodulatory effects, such as (i) modulating the activation of immune effector cells via inhibition of ROS, (ii) antagonizing high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and (iii) suppressing CCR2 gene expression.53 In murine models infected with H1N1, H3N2, or H5N1 influenza virus, the combination of statins and caffeine alleviated the lung injury, inhibited viral replication, and appeared to have similar efficacy as oseltamivir or ribavirin.54 However, an independent research study showed that statins cannot prevent patients infected with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza from developing severe disease.55 No direct evidence was shown that ACEIs or ARBs might be effective in the therapy of severe influenza-induced cytokine storm. However, these agents can inhibit the inflammatory response induced by angiotensin II and improve the survival of mice in several experimental models of acute lung injury.56 Furthermore, clinical trials also confirmed that these agents can reduce the risk of pneumonia and pneumonia-related mortality.57 Thus, both the pharmacodynamic effects and mechanisms of these generics deserve further research.",

Many severe-influenza-infected patients died from overwhelming viral pneumonia and serious complications caused by cytokine storm. In this review, we have highlighted the pathology of cytokine storm and, in particular, how an enhanced broad immune response can sometimes worsen the outcome of disease. Although the precise molecular events surrounding cytokine storm have not been clarified, immunomodulatory strategies and novel approaches in targeting the host's response to severe influenza have been advocated. Considering that these agents work on different intracellular pathways, they might ideally be used in combination to obtain a better outcome. Based on the promising results mentioned above, combination therapies pairing S1PR and PPAR agonists, COX-2 inhibitors, and antioxidants with conventional antiviral agents are promising treatments that deserve further study in randomized clinical trials. Other approaches, especially those therapeutic strategies that can target signaling pathways, either to suppress redundant immune responses or reduce viral replication, will be particularly noteworthy.",
