Existing literature supports the idea of numerous ecological impacts on joint diseases during aging (Peterson et al., 2010), including effects of the microecology of the internal environment of physical forces (Thomopoulos et al., 2007). However, there is little indication that degenerative joint disease is a direct outcome of a long\u2010term sheltered ecology for wild animals. This should not be surprising, since degenerative joint disease is known to be nonspecific, with many possible contributing factors (Pedersen et al., 2000).",

            "text": "Gray wolves are immediate ancestors to domestic dogs, and the two are biologically capable of interbreeding. Considering the close species relationship, we suggest several population implications of our results:\nObserving similar pathological joint changes among closely related species likely reflects phylogenetic conservation of physiological response capacity (Lawler, 2011), as well as fixed traits that define physical limits for morphological responses (Ham, 1969). A question for further study involves implications of similar degenerative joint pathology among species in circumstances of distant phylogenetic relationship, especially co\u2010occurring with ecological dissimilarity. The latter could imply broad evolutionary conservation of response capacities, and would raise the additional question of the role(s) of conserved joint biology in the aging process (Lawler, 2011, 2015).Mech (1970) estimated that 20% of an Ontario wolf population was over age 5 years, and showed (1998) that 6% of an Alaska wolf population was over age 5 years. Halfpenny (2003) described 20% loss of Yellowstone (USA) wolves by age 2 years, with survival beyond 2 years bringing an expected 5 years' longevity; 10 years longevity was uncommon. Mech (2006) described a wolf population in northeastern Minnesota, indicating that just 12% of \u201cnon\u2010pups\u201d were over age 5 years. Mech (1988) also summarized studies suggesting that sheltered wolves might live 9 \u2212 16 years.Population\u2010based age estimates can vary for many reasons. Influences that change population demographics over time can include climate impacts, population health, food availability, deliberate persecution, predation, accidents, and some level of sheltering by humans. Further, methods of age assessment sometimes suffer from biological inadequacy (Landon et al., 1998) and social or logistical barriers (Musiani and Paquet, 2004), thus compromising interpretations. Nonetheless, the survival estimates from the aforementioned studies are consistent with unlikely survival into late life for wolves in the wild. Further, the documented advanced ages of the wolves we evaluated clearly demonstrate the genomic capacity for advanced age in this species.More generally, Olshansky (2010) observed that aging\u2010related diseases are uncommon outside of domestication or a sheltered environment. Frailty, malnutrition, and predation reflect the rigors of free\u2010roaming existence, and mean life spans in populations are reduced in result (Olshanksy, 2010). On the other hand, events observed in sheltered populations reflect genomically possible population outcomes when stochastic causes of death are minimized and advanced life occurs more frequently. Our data serve as another confirmation of Olshansky's observations, and underscore the importance of excluding stochastic causes for mortality in studies of natural biological aging.Another genomic consideration concerns our demonstration that gray wolves have the same capacity for longevity as do domestic dogs. It is further noteworthy that the older wolves expressed a capacity for longevity that rarely is observed in the largest domestic dogs. The explanation for this difference presently is unclear, but we advance a hypothesis that post\u2010Victorian breeding selection practices applied to domestic dogs by humans have created a subspecies contrast in this respect. The IGF\u20101 gene of domestic dogs was found to explain 50% of population variation in breed size (Sutter et al., 2007), which with our observations, supports considering new research in comparative quantitative trait inheritance among canids. Comparing circulating IGF\u20101 levels in young and elderly wolves to those of large and giant breed dogs of different ages especially should be enlightening.None of the wolves that we evaluated were born in the wild. Does sheltering lead to the pathology that we observed? The wolves in our study were not free\u2010roaming, but were not confined in the manner of a zoological garden or domestic pets. The wolves' clinical histories document no lifetime history of obesity, ruling out a ubiquitous major causal co\u2010morbidity for degenerative joint disease of domestic dogs (Lawler et al., 2008). The most and least severely affected wolves were Dharma and Chetan, the two youngest at ages 5 and 8 years, which reflects variability expected in domestic dog populations (Lawler et al., 2008; Chase et al., 2011). By favorable comparison, a recent study of a Japanese village population offers species\u2010comparative data, revealing an age basis for shoulder joint osteoarthritis, with greater occurrence in persons over age 65 years (Kobayashi et al., 2014). It has been reported that onset of overt symptoms of degenerative joint disease in dogs frequently follows morphological onset by several years (Lawler et al., 2008). Thus, the time of morphological onset cannot be defined without having serial radiographs over the lifetime of dog or wolf. The clear implication is that extrapolative interpretation of (longevity x pathology) outcomes is tenuous without longitudinal data.\n",

            "text": "\nIn a previous report of shoulder pathology of domestic dogs, a high percentage of a study population had radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis by age 8 years, with progression in the population from the 6th year (Runge et al., 2008). By comparison, 6 of the 7 wolves in our study were \u2265 age 8 years, and all 7 had radiographically visible shoulder pathology. The comparative observation raises the question of whether an \u201caging threshold\u201d exists in the gray wolf, as lifetime data appear to suggest for the domestic dog (Lawler et al., 2008). Beyond such a threshold, various degenerative processes should be more readily identified, as shown by the late life occurrence of neoplasia in our study population. Only a quantity of new research will clarify the threshold question.Our observations also align with those reported from post\u2010mortem examinations of 88 domestic dogs of similar chronological ages as the wolves (Ljunggren and Olsson, 1975). Lesions in the dogs were caudo\u2010centralized on the humeral and glenoid articular surfaces. Peripheral fibrosis and osteophytosis occurred with more advanced cartilage degradation. The authors noted relatively high frequency of age\u2010related lesions, with lesion patterns that did not respect sex or body size. Also noted was lack of clear inciting causes beyond aging (Ljunggren and Olsson, 1975). The bone pathologies reported by Ljunggren and Olsson are spatially and characteristically the same as those we recorded for the gray wolf, except that our study did not involve osteochondrosis that tends to occur in younger subjects (Ljunggren and Olsson, 1975).We observed a spatial relationship between cartilage erosion and underlying bone features, consistent with chronic, deep erosive processes in cartilage that involve underlying bone secondarily. Simon and colleagues (1973) demonstrated that scapular and humeral articular contact varies from 47% (flexed) to 62% (standing) in domestic dogs, the humeral articular surface being much larger. Thus, in the canine shoulder, the scapular glenoid, and articular proximal humerus, are not in constant full point\u2010to\u2010point contact. Korvick and Athanasiou (1997) evaluated scapular and humeral articulations from seven normal dogs, observing that cartilage damage does not occur in adult dogs as the result of differential mechanical properties between scapular and humeral cartilage. Thus, the accumulated data suggest that cartilage degradation and its associated progressive histological inflammatory process are responsible for the aligned articular bone features that we observed in the gray wolves.A thought should be added with respect to pain\u2010related debilitation. Individuals perceive pain differently, some being more sensitive than others (Johnston, 2000). Maddox et al. (2013) noted that computed tomography findings in dogs were not always associated with shoulder pain, and that age was a risk factor for shoulder osteoarthritis. Thus, the degree of morphological severity of degenerative joint disease is not an obligate indicator of the degree of debilitation. Inferring a severity\u2010debilitation relationship in postmortem and archaeological specimens is possible only in a general way. Interpreting the relationship as the cause of death from archaeological specimens is tenuous at best.Lastly, the range of fatal and non\u2010fatal diseases that were recognized in the wolves we studied is not unlike those that can be found in domestic dog populations (Ljunggren and Olsson, 1975; Lawler et al., 2008, Chase et al., 2011). Again, the comparative evaluation suggests a high degree of similarity or identity between wolf and dog joint aging, and raises the new question of similar parallels among other Canidae.Data from field studies of wolf mortality are weighted heavily toward traumatic death (Wobeser, 1992), documenting early\u2010to\u2010midlife attrition from stochastic causes. Fritts and Caywood (1980) described a radio\u2010tracked Canis lupus lupus with severe osteoarthrosis of shoulders and other evidence of prior trauma. Cross (1940) described two adult timber wolves (Canis lupus lycaon), both with osteoarthrosis of diarthrodial joints and vertebral pathology, along with other evidence of prior trauma. Both authors probably misdiagnosed the wolves' ages by overestimation, given that dental condition reflects nutrition, environment, behavior, and health in various ways. It appears that one author also overlooked the role of repeated trauma in chronic bone changes. Even so, the pattern of wolf osteoarthropathy resembled that seen in domestic dogs.Methodological comparison of shoulder osteochondrosis using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), arthrography, arthroscopy, and histology, revealed correlations among the methods (van Bree et al., 1993). In that study, MRI demonstrated low\u2010signal foci coincident with inflammation of subchondral bone, as well as mixed signaling from degenerative cartilage.In another study, ultrasonographic examination was shown to be useful as an imaging approach to canine shoulder osteochondrosis, joint mice, joint effusion, and (quoting the authors) \u201cdistinct new bone formation\u201d (Vandevelde et al., 2006). A more recent report indicated that both methodology (including MRI) and positioning for evaluation are important to diagnosis of osteochondrosis (Wall et al., 2014), and the authors recommended more frequent use of advanced imaging in suspected occurrences.Our data indicate that computed tomography yielded more information than radiography, while direct examination of postmortem specimens afforded greater opportunity to interpret other observations. Thus, imaging modalities that are used should reflect study circumstances as well as the information that investigators are seeking.Olsson (1971) reported morphology of subchondral sclerosis and joint margin osteophytes, again reflecting compatibility with our observations of gray wolves. Involved subchondral bone becomes hypomineralized, microfractured, and develops microstructural alterations resembling cysts (Li et al., 2013). When interpreting archaeological canid dry bone specimens, it is useful to retain this mental view of the overall process of degenerative joint disease, as observed in the domestic dog.Gross morphology and histology of the glenoid labrum in dogs has defined the relationship among articular cartilage, subchondral bone, and the collection of supporting structures and their attachments (Sager et al., 2013).The close association among the tendon of origin of the biceps muscle, fibrocartilagenous labrum, medial and lateral glenohumeral ligaments, and a meniscoid fold, illustrate the complexity of the mammalian shoulder support system (Sager et al., 2013). The elucidated anatomical relationships underscore the potential for soft tissue injury immediately proximate to the articular surface, and thus expand the list of potential differential diagnoses in biomedical and archaeological investigations of degenerative joint disease. Clearly, further studies of degenerative joint disease in wildlife should include investigation of the shoulder joint support system.Studies of induced or naturally occurring osteoarthritis have identified various cytokines, chemokines, and matrix metalloproteases that can be detected in biological fluids. Further elucidating molecular events that occur during development of canid degenerative joint disease will support new understanding of response commonality across species (Garner et al., 2011) and the nature of its origins in genetic conservation.\n",
