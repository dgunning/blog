Furthermore, even with this technique the sample risks to be contaminated by pathogens from the upper respiratory tract [9\u201311]. To date, bronchoscopy and BAL are recommended for immunosuppressed patients or for patients in which the antibiotic therapy has failed to resolve the infection [12, 13].

The filter is then analysed through molecular and microbiological tests, in order to detect the presence of different pathogens [27]. Fluid mechanics principles allow the filter to separate aerosol particles from the lungs and the air coming from the upper respiratory tract. When the patient coughs into the device, the air from the upper respiratory tract flows into the reservoir, which offers lower resistances compared to the filter. It should be reminded that normally, during exhalation, the anatomic dead space contaminates the first volume of air coming from the lungs; since the PneumoniaCheckTM reservoir has a volume of 250 ml, it ensures the separation of all the aerosols particles of the upper airways, with a 100 ml margin on the average dead anatomic space [28]. Furthermore, the reservoir bag is inelastic, forcing the subsequent exhaled air through the above-mentioned filter, allowing to collect only the lower respiratory tract aerosols (figure 2).",

The remaining 700 \u03bcl were used for RT-PCR tests using the Elite MGB Kits (ELITechGroup Inc.) for Herpesviruses. Through the Elite MGB Kits, it was possible to detect Herpes Simplex Virus-1, Herpes Simplex Virus-2, Varicella-Zoster Virus, Epstein-Barr Virus, Human CMV and Human Herpes Virus-6. Subsequently, a bronchoscopy with a BAL was performed on each patient and the same determinations were done in the same way on specimens obtained by BAL. Each BAL and its adequacy were performed and evaluated in accordance with international guidelines [33]; for each patient we recorded the volume of fluid recovery and its adequacy. The amount of BAL fluid destined to microbiological and virological analysis was 5 ml. For the virological testing with RT PCRs, we used 1 ml of BAL fluid.

The incidence of viral pathogens in this context is highly variable among the studies and it is often influenced by the diagnostic techniques [36]. Nevertheless, a prompt and definitive diagnosis remains the cornerstone for the management and treatment of viral respiratory infections [37]. In CAP, some of the most important viruses involved are Influenza and Parainfluenza, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Adenovirus, Coronavirus and Rinhovirus [36, 38] and they can be detected through analyses of serum samples, cultures, rapid diagnostic testing with enzyme immunoassay or immunofluorescence [39, 40]. Nevertheless, the introduction of PCR has increased the diagnostic yields, compared to the conventional diagnostic procedures [41]. Despite all these tools, it remains difficult in some cases to determine whether one of these pathogens is involved in the development of the infection. As a matter of fact, it is considered that only the detection of the Influenza virus can be seen as an actual etiologic factor and not as colonisation. Thus, prudence is required in interpreting the results, as up to 15% of healthy people are carriers of respiratory tract viruses [42].",

Moreover, by analysing different alcohol and oxygen levels, it has been demonstrated that PneumoniaCheckTM is able to efficaciously separate gas from the upper and the lower airways (p < 0.0001) [43]. The same study evaluated the collection proprieties of the filter by testing the viral filtration efficiency, which resulted to be 99.9975%, with a mean particle size of 2.8 \u03bcm. With this results the authors confirmed both that the filter used in the PneumoniaCheckTM is able to capture 99.99% of viruses in aerosol particles and that PCR analysis on bacterial DNA could be performed (notably, the authors evaluated the efficacy of RT-PCR only for bacteria and not for viruses). Moreover, the A-M System Inc. who produced the VBMax filter incorporated in PneumoniaCheckTM, used the Bacteriophage X174 to test the viral filtration efficiency; due to the diameter of the Bacteriophage X174, we can presume that the filter of PneumoniaCheckTM is actually able to collect a large quality of viruses screened by RT-PCR system (only Rhinoviruses, Enteroviruses and Bocaviruses have dimension similar to the Bacteriophage X174).",

Nevertheless, the patients\u2019 medical history was peculiar and well-known by the physicians and tests were performed for bacteria very likely to be present in the airways. In this study we decided to focus our attention on viral pathogens, as they are more difficult to detect compared to the bacterial ones, and since the biological samples are more likely to be naive of antimicrobial treatment, reducing this risk of bias. According to the literature, the prevalence of virus isolations on BAL fluid in patients with CAP or HAP is about 17%, but it is estimated to be higher in case of transplanted patients [44, 45]. One of the drawbacks of BAL is the risk to obtain an inadequate specimen, due to the variability of the sampling procedure [46]. As a matter of fact, in our cohort, 2 of the 12 BAL samples were considered as inadequate for a definitive diagnosis. Conversely, all PneumoniaCheckTM collections were adequate for virological analysis, showing good ability of this device in obtaining good samples. The array of viruses isolated through PneumoniaCheckTM is in line with community acquired respiratory viruses: Herpes Simplex Virus 1, Virus Influenzae A, Epstein-Barr Virus, Human Herpes Virus 6, Virus Parainfluenzae, Rhinovirus and Syncitial Respiratory Virus. The only case of Influenza Virus present in our cohort was detected by both BAL and PneumoniaCheckTM.",

On the other hand, it is necessary to highlight the role of this family of viruses in the pathogenesis of lower respiratory tract infections both in the immunocompromised and in the immunocompetent host. In the latter group, the infection usually has an asymptomatic or mononucleosis-like syndrome course but, occasionally, a primary cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection can evolve into more severe organ-specific manifestations [47\u201352]. Furthermore, as previously mentioned, many patients may display a colonisation from herpes viruses and, thus, a positive PCR might not be sufficient to distinguish asymptomatic colonisation from an active infection. Conversely, quantification of the viral load on BAL fluid could potentially differentiate between these two conditions [53].",

Herpes viruses transmission occurs usually through inhalation of oral secretion. In literature, studies evaluating virus colonization of droplets are lacking and, for this reason, details regarding the patient-to-patient transmission of viruses are matter of discussion [54]. However, we know that PneumoniaCheckTM collects particles originating from lower airways (mainly over the dead space) giving sample of the colonizing viruses. Furthermore, we must consider that different viruses have different targets in the airways: in fact non-herpes viruses are responsible for the bigger part of viral pneumonia, colonizing the bronchial surface and sometimes the alveolar one. On the contrary, herpes viruses usually colonize the upper airways (rarely the lower ones); this could partially explain our results, since the upper airways are excluded from the sampling [55]. In addition, since BAL fluid can collect a higher number of viruses and cells infected, by washing the alveolar and bronchial surface, the possibility to evaluate the presence of viruses through Q-PCR leads to higher quantitative results.",

The population of the study was not known, and the diagnostic pathway required a larger displacement of diagnostic tools.

Second, the microbiological analyses were limited to virological samples, excluding standard bacterial and fungal cultures. Nevertheless, the restricted amount of biologic sample collected into the filter of PneumoniaCheckTM would have not been sufficient for a complete investigation of a wide range of possibly involved bacteria in a non-selected population. Conversely, this issue could become a strength of the device, as it could allow a rapid identification of bacteria and viruses in specific and highly-selected populations, as lung transplanted and CF patients. Finally, another limit of the device is the filtering power of the filter used in the PneumoniaCheckTM: the great portion of aerosol size in exhaled air ranges from 0.3 to 0.5 \u03bcm and for this reason some negative PneumoniaCheckTM results are in contrast with those positive obtained with BAL [56]. Nevertheless, as demonstrated by Lindsay et al a high number of influenza RNA could be found also in particles with an aerodynamic diameter greater than 4 \u03bcm [57]. For this reason we think that, even if the filter has a collecting efficiency of 3 \u03bcm, a significant number of particles carrying viruses can be collected.",
