In this study, we used a standardized and validated real-time RT-PCR assay to detect and determine the viral load of SARS-CoV in multiple organs from a large number of individuals who died of SARS during the Toronto outbreak, compared with those who died of other causes. We demonstrate that, even 51 days after disease onset, SARS-CoV was consistently found in multiple lung lobes, suggesting that there is widespread dissemination of the virus throughout the lung at time of death. Further, we observed extrapulmonary dissemination of the virus into all major organs, especially the bowel and lymph nodes.

Necropsy results indicated the widespread presence of SARS-CoV in lung but only sporadic presence of the virus in the duodenum, kidney, and spleen. Although our findings that SARS-CoV is detected in postmortem human lung tissue correspond to those of Kuilken et al., their observation that virus was only sporadically identified in other organs differs from our observations in fatal human infection. Kuilken et al. attribute this sporadic detection to overspill from other tissues, perhaps via blood, but do not comment on the SARS-CoV viral load in any tissue. Our findings suggest extrapulmonary SARS-CoV dissemination and demonstrate comparable viral loads in small bowel, large bowel, and lymph nodes. These data, combined with evidence of viral shedding in stool and urine, viral replication in the gut, and reports of transient viremia and relatively low viral loads in the blood, suggest that viral overspill is perhaps a less likely explanation for the extrapulmonary dissemination of SARS-CoV that we observed in humans [12].",

In this study, we demonstrated that the majority of patients had evidence of SARS-CoV in both large and small bowel, often at high viral loads. These data suggest that SARS-CoV displays tissue tropism for the bowel and provide a putative mechanism for the frequent occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms in this population. This hypothesis is supported by observations that SARS-CoV is frequently and persistently identified in fecal specimens [1, 2, 11] and by recent electronic microscopic evidence indicating viral replication and recovery of SARS-CoV from postmortem small-bowel specimens [12]. Collectively, these observations indicate that enteric involvement is common in SARS and have implications for infection-control measures and the potential for fecal-oral transmission in community outbreaks.",

In this study, we observed a relationship between the presence of SARS-CoV in the liver and antemortem abnormal liver function tests, supporting a role for SARS-CoV in mediating hepatic dysfunction. Furthermore, splenic atrophy and lymphadenopathy with tissue necrosis have also been reported in SARS [2, 7, 8]. These findings can potentially be explained by our observations of elevated viral loads at these sites. Ding et al. hypothesized that the degenerative changes observed in these organs are most likely due to disturbed cell metabolism caused by rapid viral replication [8], but the authors lacked the viral-load evidence we present here to support these contentions. Although organ damage in patients with SARS may be the immunopathologic consequence of an exuberant host response [2], evidence of elevated viral loads and of extrapulmonary viral dissemination suggests that regional viral replication could also potentially contribute to organ dysfunction and exacerbate the host response at these sites.",
