            "text": "Mannose-binding lectin is a C-type serum lectin and is primarily produced by the liver (Bouwman et al. 2005) in response to infection, and is part of many other factors termed \u201chttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_phase_protein\u201d \\o \u201cAcute phase protein\u201d acute phase proteins. MBL is made up of 96-kDa structural units, which in turn are composed of three identical 32-kDa primary subunits. The subunits consist of an N-terminal cross-linking region, a collagenlike domain, and a C-terminal carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) (Chap. 23; Turner and Hamvas 2000). Circulating MBL is composed of higher-order oligomeric structures, which include dimers, trimers, tetramers, pentamers, and hexamers of the structural homotrimeric unit. The oligomeric configuration of the structural units allows the MBL molecule to have multiple CRDs, facilitating multivalent ligand binding. Each CRD of MBL is structurally identical and is able to bind a range of oligosaccharides including N-acetylglucosamine D-mannose, Nacetylmannosamine, and L-fucose (Turner 1996). Although the various sugars are bound with different affinities, the cluster-like array of multiple binding sites allows activation of complement to be most effective. MBL is considered to play a major role in innate defense against pathogens, involving recognition of arrays of MBLbinding carbohydrates on microbial surfaces. However, recent studies have shown that MBL is also involved in the recognition of self-targets, such as apoptotic and necrotic cells (Nauta et al. 2003). In plasma, MBL is associated with MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs). Currently, three MASPs have been identified, MASP-1, MASP-2, and MASP-3 (Chap. 23).",

            "text": "MBL belongs to the class of collectins in the C-type lectin superfamily, whose function appears to be pattern recognition in the first line of defense in the pre-immune host. MBL recognizes carbohydrate patterns, found on the surface of a large number of pathogenic micro-organisms, including bacteria, viruses, protozoa and fungi. Mannose-binding lectin binds to the repeating sugar arrays on surfaces of pathogens through multiple lectin domains and, following binding, is able to activate the complement system via an associated serum protease, MASP-2. Importantly, MBL activates the complement system through a distinctive third pathway, independent of both antibody and the C1 complex (Table 42.1). The MBL binds to neutral carbohydrates on microbial surfaces and recognises carbohydrates such as mannose, glucose, l-fucose, N-acetyl-mannosamine (ManNAc), and N-acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc). Oligomerisation of MBL enables high avidity binding to repetitive carbohydrate ligands, such as those present on microbial surfaces, including E. coli, Klebisella aerogenes, Neisseria meningitides, Staphylococcus aureus, S. pneumonia, A. fumigatus and C. albicans (c/r Kerrigan and Brown 2009). However, there is also a great variation in the binding of MBL to various organisms; Candida albicans, \u03b2-haemolytic group A Streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus bind with high affinity, while Clostridium sp. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, b-haemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae exhibit low or no binding (Santos et al. 2001). It is also observed that some organisms (e.g. Klebsiella sp. and Escherichia coli) show a variable pattern of binding. Later, it was shown that the absence of sialic acid from the lipo-oligosaccharide (LOS) of Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B, serogroup C and Neisseria gonorrhoeae permits MBL binding and presence of sialic acid on LOS results in poor or no MBL binding. In a similar study on Salmonella sp, it was found that MBL binds to rough chemotype but exhibits low or no binding with smooth chemotype (Ambrosio and De Messias-Reason 2005). In order to activate the complement system after MBL binds to its target (for example, mannose on the surface of a bacterium), the MASP protein functions to cleave the blood protein C4 into C4a and C4b. The C4b fragments can then bind to the surface of the bacterium, and initiate the formation of a C3 convertase. The subsequent complement cascade, catalyzed by C3 convertase, results in creating a membrane attack complex, which causes the lysis of the pathogen to which MBL is bound (Worthley et al. 2005, 2006) (Fig. 42.1). Being an important component of innate immunity, acting as an ante-antibody and/or as a disease modifier, MBL is thought to influence disorders as diverse as meningococcal disease, rheumatoid arthritis, cystic fibrosis and recurrent miscarriage. Vulvovaginal candidiasis is a yeast infection of vulva and vagina; millions of women suffer from vulvovaginal candidiasis 5 worldwide. Women bearing MBL variant allele are at a higher risk for vulvovaginal candidiasis syndrome 343. The cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) MBL levels and gene mutation frequency were both higher in women suffering from vulvovaginal candidiasis than in controls (Liu et al. 2006b). On the other hand, MBL levels were low (0.30 ng/mL) in women with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis and were associated with a high gene mutation frequency compared to controls (1.28 ng/mL) (Ip and Lau 2004). Parenteral administration of MBL increased resistance of mice to hematogenously disseminated candidiasis. Thus, MBL plays an important role in innate resistance to candidiasis, suggesting a protective role of lectin in female genital tract infection (Pellis et al. 2005).\n",

            "text": "Nevertheless, MBL genotyping of various populations has led to the suggestion that there may be some biological advantage associated with absence of the protein. In addition, the protein also modulates disease severity, at least in part through a complex, dose-dependent influence on cytokine production. Moreover, there appears to be a genetic balance in which individuals generally benefit from high levels of the protein. These findings suggest that the concept of MBL as a protein involved solely in first line defense is an over-simplification and the protein should rather be viewed as having a range of activities including disease modulation (Turner and Hamvas 2000; Dommett et al. 2006; Worthley et al. 2006). The mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in such processes remain to be elucidated. Though the deficiency of MBL is associated with increased susceptibility to infections, Roos et al. (2004) indicated that antibody-mediated classical pathway activation can compensate for impaired target opsonization via MBL pathway in MBL-deficient individuals. Lack of MBL may be most relevant in the context of a co-existing secondary immune deficiency. Replacement therapy appears promising. The development of a recombinant product should permit the extension of MBL therapy to randomized clinical trials of sufficient size to provide clear evidence about the physiological significance of this intriguing glycoprotein. The MBL has attracted great interest as a potential candidate for passive immunotherapy to prevent infection (Gupta et al. 2008).",

            "text": "The concentration of MBL in plasma is determined genetically, primarily by the genetic polymorphism of the first exon of the structural gene and promoter region. The gene encoding MBL, MBL2 (MBL1 is a pseudogene), is located on long arm chromosome 10q11.2\u2013q21 and contains four exons. A number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been characterized in the gene. Exon 1 harbours three missense SNPs, giving rise to amino acid exchanges in the first part of the collagenous region. Two of these SNPs: Gly54Asp, named \u2018B\u2019 and Gly57Glu, named \u2018C\u2019 exchange glycine with an acetic amino acid. The third (Arg52Cys, \u2018D\u2019) introduces a cysteine in the collagen region (the residue numbers includes the leader sequence of 20 residues) (Fig. 42.2). The wild type is denoted \u2018A\u2019. Heterozygous individuals for D, B, and C mutations have a substantial decrease in MBL serum concentration, whereas MBL is undetectable in the serum of homozygous individuals. Three structural mutations within exon 1 at codons 52, 54, and 57 have been invariably referred to as the D, B and C variants. In addition to these three variant structural alleles, the promoter region also shows a number of SNPs as well, some of which influences the expression of MBL. The three SNPs in the coding region of the MBL2 gene those are associated with abnormal polymerization of the MBL molecule, decreased serum concentrations of MBL and strongly impaired function. These MBL SNPs are associated with increased susceptibility to infections, especially in immune-compromised persons, as well as with accelerated progression of chronic diseases. Normal serum levels of MBL range from 800 to 1,000 ng/mL in healthy Caucasians, however, wide variations can occur due to point mutations in codons 52, 54 and 57 of exon 1 and in the promotor region of the MBL gene (Turner 2003). Separate point mutations in the collagenous domain of human MBL are associated with immune-deficiency, caused by reduced complement activation by the variant MBLs as well as by lower serum MBL concentrations.\n",

In a cohort of 236 Australian blood donors, 5 MBL promoter and coding SNPs were genotyped. Significant associations were found between both coding and promoter polymorphisms and MBL antigenic and functional levels (Minchinton et al. 2002). Point mutations in exon 1 at codons 52, 54 and 57 and a promoter polymorphism at \u2212221 bp of MBL gene were associated with increased susceptibility to various infectious diseases (Steffensen et al. 2003; Roos et al. 2006). The codon 54 mutation was frequent in both a British Caucasian and a Hong Kong Chinese population. The replacement of glycine-54 with an aspartic acid residue disrupts the fifth Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeat in the collagen-like domain of each 32 kDa MBP peptide chain and prevents the formation of the normal triple helix (Sumiya et al. 1991). Super et al. (1992) suggested that this genotype occurs in 5% of the population and encodes a functional protein. Super et al. (1992) also suggested that the Gly54Asp allele does not account for a deficiency state, but instead suggested that MBP may have two predominant allelic forms that have overlapping function and differ only in their ability to activate the classical pathway of complement.",

The resulting proteins are secreted almost exclusively as heterooligomers that were defective in activating the complement cascade. Functional defects were caused by structural changes to the N-terminal collagenous and cysteine-rich domains of MBP, disrupting interactions with associated serine proteases. These mutations demonstrated how a SNP gives rise to the molecular defects that lead to the disease phenotype in heterozygous individuals (Wallis 2002). Wallis et al. (2005) analyzed the molecular and functional defects associated with two variant proteins of lectin pathway. Mutations Gly25\u2192Asp and Gly28\u2192Glu created comparable structural changes in rat MBL but the G28E variant activated complement >10-fold less efficiently than the G25D variant, which in turn had approximately sevenfold lower activity than wild-type MBL. Analysis of mutant MBL-MASP-2 complexes formed from recombinant proteins showed that reduced complement activation by both mutant MBLs was due to failure of activation of MASP-2 efficiently on binding to a mannan-coated surface. Disruption of MBL-MASP-2 interactions as well as to changes in oligomeric structure and reduced binding to carbohydrate ligands compared with wild-type MBL probably account for the intermediate phenotype of the G25D variant. However, carbohydrate binding and MASP-2 activation are ostensibly completely decoupled in complexes assembled from the G28E mutant, such that the rate of MASP-2 activation is no greater than the basal rate of zymogen MASP-2 autoactivation. Analogous molecular defects in human MBL probably combine to create the mutant phenotypes of immunodeficient individuals (Wallis et al. 2005).",

While addressing possible correlation between MBL levels and clinical conditions an issue is how to define MBL deficiency. The physiologically relevant MBL level leading to clinical manifestations is likely to differ in different diseases. In the examples given below, a number of different levels have been used as cut-off values defining MBL deficiency. Judged from clinical trials it appears that at least 200 ng MBL/mL plasma is needed for reconstituting in vitro functional activity (C4b deposition) after MBL infusion in MBL deficient individuals (Valdimarsson et al. 2004). On the other hand, in leukaemic patients a cut-off level of 500 ng/mL or more has been suggested (Peterslund et al. 2001; Neth et al. 2001), and in the cases of obstetric problems even lower levels (100 ng/mL) have been indicated.",

While glycosylation of HIV gp120/gp41 provides a formidable barrier for development of strong antibody responses to the virus, it also provides a potential site of attack by the innate immune system through MBL/MBP. The MBL that binds to HIV depends on the high-mannose glycans present on gp120 while host cell glycans incorporated into virions do not contribute substantially to this interaction. The MBL has been shown to interact with all tested HIV strains. However, drugs that alter processing of carbohydrates enhance neutralization of HIV primary isolates by MBL. Complement activation on gp120 and opsonization of HIV due to MBL binding have also been observed but these immune mechanisms have not been studied in detail. MBL has also been shown to block the interaction between HIV and DC-SIGN. Clinical studies show that levels of MBL, an acute-phase protein, increase during HIV disease. Because of apparently universal reactivity with HIV strains, MBL clearly represents an important mechanism for recognition of HIV by the immune system. However, further studies are needed to define the in vivo contribution of MBL to clearance and destruction of HIV (Botos and Wlodawer 2005; Ji et al. 2005). MBL that binds to high mannose glycans on HIV-1 (gp120), has been shown to neutralize the cell line-adapted strain HIV(IIIB). But HIV primary isolates (PI) are generally more resistant to neutralization by antibodies. Considering that PI are produced in primary cells that could alter the number of high mannose glycans on HIV relative to cell lines, Ying et al. (2004) showed that both PI and cell line-adapted HIV, despite binding of MBL, are relatively resistant to neutralization by levels of MBL normally present in serum. However, binding and opsonization of HIV by MBL may alter virus trafficking and viral-antigen presentation during HIV infection (Ying et al. 2004).",

Production of HIV in the presence of the mannosidase I inhibitor deoxymannojirimycin (dMM) significantly enhanced binding of HIV to MBL and increased MBL neutralization of an M-tropic HIV primary isolate. In contrast, HIV cultured in presence of alpha-glucosidase I and II inhibitors, castanospermine and deoxynojirimycin showed only slight effect on virus binding and neutralization by MBL. The study suggested that specific alterations of the N-linked carbohydrates on HIV gp120/gp41 can enhance MBL-mediated neutralization of virus by strengthening the interaction of HIV-1 with MBL (Hart et al. 2003).",

There was, however, no association between MBL genotypes, which are associated with low or deficient serum levels of MBL, and mortality related to SARS. MBL could bind SARS-CoV in calcium-dependent and mannan-inhibitable fashion in vitro, suggesting that binding is through the carbohydrate recognition domains of MBL. Furthermore, deposition of complement C4 on SARS-CoV was enhanced by MBL. Inhibition of the infectivity of SARS-CoV by MBL in fetal rhesus kidney cells suggested that MBL contributes to the first-line host defense against SARS-CoV and that MBL deficiency is a susceptibility factor for acquisition of SARS (Ip et al. 2005).",

            "text": "The etiology of autoimmune diseases is largely unknown. Studies on associations between MBL deficiency and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been discussed in reviews (Graudal 2004; Barton et al. 2004). Results depend on ethnic groups, type of patients and the symptoms studied. Low levels of serum MBL are associated with a higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), joint swelling score, limitation of joint motion score, and annual increase in radiographic destruction score. Despite this, indications are that low MBL levels may be linked with symptoms indicating a poor prognosis as well as an earlier debut. Whether variant alleles of the MBL gene causing low serum concentrations of MBL are associated with increased susceptibility to RA and erosive outcome in an inception cohort of patients with early polyarthritis was studied by Jacobsen et al. (2001). Jacobsen et al. (2001) suggested that MBL variant alleles appear to be weak susceptibility markers for RA, and patients with early polyarthritis and homozygous for MBL structural variant alleles have a higher risk of developing early erosive RA. These findings, together with the positive association between MBL variant alleles and the increased serum levels of IgM RF and CRP, point at the MBL gene as a relevant locus in the pathophysiology of RA. Graudal (2004) indicated that MBL-deficient patients have a relative risk of a severe radiographic event of 3.1 compared with the MBL competent group. The relative risk (RR) of early IL-1\u03b1 auto-antibodies positive patients developing serious radiographic joint destruction was significantly lower than for IL-1\u03b1 auto-antibodies-negative patients. Perhaps MBL and IL-1\u03b1 auto-antibodies are predictors of prognosis of RA and play important roles in the pathogenesis of RA (Graudal 2004; Lee et al. 2005). Low levels of the protein have been related to a poor prognosis in rheumatoid arthritis perhaps due to the modulatory action that MBL exerts on the secretion of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, a central molecule in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (Graudal et al. 2000). Low MBL levels have also been associated with adult dermatomyositis and are probably related to a reduced clearance of apoptotic keratinocytes (Werth et al. 2002). Genotypes related to a lower production of MBL have also been linked to the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (Villarreal et al. 2001; Davies et al. 1995).",

Two structural polymorphisms of MBP, associated with low serum levels of MBP, were found with significantly increased frequency in the SLE patient population. In contrast, a promoter haplotype associated with particularly high serum levels of MBP was negatively associated with SLE. Thus, it seemed that deficiencies of MBP predispose individuals to SLE (Sullivan et al. 1996). The distribution of promoter variants of the MBL gene and correlations between the promoter variants and serum MBL concentrations in Chinese patients with SLE were investigated. Significant differences in the distribution of the two pairs of promoter polymorphisms, H/L and Y/X, between SLE patients and controls, were observed. Analysis of the correlation between promoter haplotypes and serum MBL levels revealed HY as the highest-producing, LY as the intermediate-producing, and LX as the lowest-producing haplotypes. The LX haplotype was present at a frequency of 0.259 in SLE patients and 0.154 in controls and was significantly associated with SLE. The low-producing promoter polymorphism of the MBL gene is associated with SLE, and a low serum MBL level is a risk factor for SLE (Ip et al. 1998). Whether occurrence, characteristics, and progression of SLE are associated with polymorphism of the MBL gene and with serum MBL concentration, Takahashi et al. (2005) reported that MBL gene polymorphism influences susceptibility to SLE, but has no direct effect on disease characteristics. Serum MBL levels fluctuate during the course of SLE in individual patients. MBL genotyping may be useful in assessing the risk of infection during treatment of SLE (Takahashi et al. 2005). MBL and Fc\u03b3RII (CD32) polymorphisms have both been implicated as candidate susceptibility genes in SLE. These patients carried MBL codon 54 mutant allele more frequently than controls and the haplotype HY W52 W54 W57 was significantly lower in cases compared with controls. The MBL gene codon 54 mutant allele appears to be a risk factor for SLE, whilst haplotypes encoding for high levels of MBL are protective against the disease. However, differences between controls and patients were not significant when Fc\u03b3RIIa polymorphisms were considered (Villarreal et al. 2001).",

Thus, in addition to the classical pathway and the alternative pathway, the lectin pathway of complement activation is also involved in murine lupus nephritis (Trouw et al. 2005). SLE patients were associated with a reduced functional activity of the MBL pathway of complement, in relation to expression of MBL variant alleles, increased levels of autoantibodies against cardiolipin and C1q, but not against MBL. The enhanced production of autoantibodies may be related to disturbed clearance of apoptotic material due to impaired MBL function (Seelen et al. 2005). Cohorts of MRL-lpr mice, which are known to develop age-dependent SLE-like disease showed that at 2 months of age all mice already had elevated levels of anti-C1q autoantibodies, and elution of kidneys confirmed the presence of these antibodies in renal immune deposits in MRL-lpr mice and not in control MRL+/+ mice. Thus, anti-C1q antibodies are already present in serum and immune deposits of the kidney early in life and therefore can play a role in nephritis during experimental SLE-like disease in mice (Trouw et al. 2004).",

The presence of autoantibodies to MBL, analogous to autoantibodies to C1q in patients with SLE, contributes to the disease development. Anti-MBL autoantibodies were of the IgG isotype and the binding site of IgG anti-MBL was located in the F(ab\u2019)2 portion. Anti-MBL are present in sera from SLE patients and influence the functional activity of MBL (Seelen et al. 2003). More SLE patients have IgG anti-MBL antibodies than normal controls. However, in SLE, these antibodies are neither sensitive nor specific for this condition. They occur more frequently in (proliferative) lupus nephritis, particularly during active disease. Furthermore, levels of anti-C1q rise, in many cases, prior to a relapse of lupus nephritis, suggesting a pathogenic role for the autoantibodies in immune complex-mediated renal disease. In addition, anti-C1q may interfere with the clearance of apoptotic cells, so influencing induction and expression of autoimmunity (Kallenberg 2008; Mok et al. 2004).",

Clinical studies of critically ill patients requiring intensive care management have shown that individuals who are MBL deficient are more likely to develop the SIRS and progress to septic shock and death (Garred et al. 2003b; Fidler et al. 2004), findings which may well relate to the proinflammatory cytokine response. In some cases, SIRS occurs in response to infection and \u201csepsis\u201d is then used to describe the symptoms. More severely a septic shock may develop with multi-organ dysfunctions (MOD). The MBL levels and genotypes were investigated in 272 adults (197 with sepsis) prospectively admitted to the ICU. No difference was seen between genotype frequencies in patients with SIRS as compared to healthy controls. But the frequency of MBL variant genotypes was significantly higher in patients with sepsis compared with the patients without sepsis, and the risk ratios for the development of \u201csevere sepsis\u201d and \u201cseptic shock\u201d ranged from 1.3 to 3.2 times higher in patients with A/O or O/O versus A/A genotype. MBL levels were inversely related to the severity of sepsis (Garred et al. 2003a, b). The SNP of MBL with clinical phenotype in critically ill Caucasians with SIRS are associated with increased prevalence of positive bacterial cultures at admission to the ICU. Patients in low MBL haplotype group did not have significantly increased rates of sepsis or septic shock at admission to the ICU. Survival at day 28 did not differ significantly between the low MBL haplotype and high MBL haplotype groups. Furthermore, MBL was not associated with a particular organism class. The prevalence of the codon 54 mutation of MBL gene in patients having repeated respiratory infections as well as the prevalence of MBL mutant genotype among patients with diffuse panbronchiolitis was further supported (Gomi et al. 2004).",

A sevenfold greater risk of developing SIRS within 48 h of admission (60% of the patients) was observed for those carrying MBL variant alleles than those with wild type alleles (A/O + O/O vs. A/A). A significant relation was also found between severity of the systemic response to infection and the presence of an MBL mutation. If the severity of illness among the patients admitted with infections was divided into localized infection, sepsis, and septic shock, the median MBL levels were inversely related to severity, and the children with MBL levels below 1,000 ng/mL had a greater chance of developing SIRS. A study of the frequency of sepsis in very low birth weight infants did not reveal statistical significance in clinical data between infants with and without specific mutations in a number of genes, including MBL genotypes (Ahrens et al. 2004). Following surgery of 156 patients undergoing major elective gastrointestinal surgery for malignant disease, Siassi et al. (2003) reported that patients who developed sepsis or SIRS showed significantly lower mean post-operative MBL levels. In colorectal cancer patients, postoperative infection is associated with poor prognosis. Ytting et al. (2005) have reported significantly increased frequency of pneumonia after primary operation in colorectal carcinoma patients who were having low MBL levels. MBL deficiency appears to play an important role in susceptibility of critical ill patients to the development and progression of sepsis and septic shock, and confers a substantially increased risk of fatal outcome. There is clearly a need for improvement in defining which patient groups and which clinical data are relevant to examine.",

Though very little is known about the genetic factors, but there is a strong association of two HLA haplotypes (DQ2 or \u03b11*05, \u03b21*02 and DQ8 or \u03b11*0301, \u03b21*0302) with the disease. Boniotto et al. (2002) indicated an association between celiac disease and the presence of variant MBL alleles. Boniotto et al. (2005) and Iltanen et al. (2003) reported the frequency of homozygosity for variant MBL alleles to be higher in the patients. Among 149 Italian celiac patients, 116 showed the presence of DQ2 or DQ8. MBL2 allele and genotype frequencies varied significantly between celiac patients and healthy humans. It is likely that in those rare cases of celiac disease that are negative for DQ2 and DQ8, the non-HLA susceptibility genotypes would exert a greater effect. The study also analyzed apoptosis within small intestinal biopsy specimens, and showed that MBL tended to aggregate to areas of apoptosis within the epithelium. MBL has been implicated in the normal clearance of apoptotic bodies (Nauta et al. 2003; Ogden et al. 2001). The authors postulated that the association between MBL and celiac disease, and indeed other autoimmune conditions, could relate to impaired apoptosis, whereby MBL deficiency impairs the normal removal and clearance of apoptotic cells that may subsequently reveal previously hidden self-antigen, causing loss of self-tolerance, and spreading of autoimmunity (Boniotto et al. 2005). The association between variant MBL2 alleles and coeliac disease has also been confirmed within the Finnish population (Iltanen et al. 2003) (Worthley et al. 2006). The low MBL genotypes were strongly associated with more celiac disease symptoms as well with increased frequency of secondary autoimmune diseases. By immunohistochemistry MBL was found to be present, together with apoptotic cells, in the basal lamina under the intestinal epithelium, where they had previously found mRNA for MBL. Boniotto et al. suggested that impaired removal of apoptotic cells due to MBL deficiency might predispose to the development of autoimmune symptoms. Mice lacking MBL have been shown to be less efficient in removal of apoptotic cells (Stuart et al. 2005). In vitro studies have also implicated MBL in removal of apoptotic cells (Ogden et al. 2001; Nauta et al. 2004). Alternative explanation could be that increased susceptibility to intestinal infections and diarrhea, associated with low MBL, may change the intestinal epithelia thus allowing for abnormal stimulation of anti-gliadin immune responses and triggering of the cascade leading to celiac disease. A role for MBL like in celiac disease could be easily applied to other autoimmune disorders.",

One notable exception is the association between MBL deficiency and risk of Cryptosporidium parvum enteritis. This study indicated that patients with biallelic coding mutations (O/O) had a significantly greater chance of cryptosporidiosis compared to those who were either wild-type or heterozygous for MBL2 mutation (Kelly et al. 2000). The association between MBL deficiency and cryptosporidiosis was confirmed in young Haitian children by Kirkpatrick et al. (2006). However, the two combined studies present compelling evidence for the role of MBL in the host defense against Cryptosporidium spp. infection. However, MBL deficiency was not associated with an increased risk of Escherichia coli 0157: H7 colitis nor the complication of HUS (Proulx et al. 2003). H. pylori is one of the most common human bacterial infections, affecting approximately 50% of humans. Several immunogenetic polymorphisms are associated with clinical outcomes in H. pylori infection, as well as with the risk of infection itself. H pylori activates MBL in vitro (c/r Worthley et al. 2006). Studies demonstrated that H. pylori-related chronic gastritis causes an increase in gastric mucosal MBL expression, but no association was found between MBL2 genotype and risk of chronic gastritis (Bak-Romaniszyn et al. 2006; Worthley et al. 2007).",

            "text": "Whereas MBL deficiency has been associated with rheumatic disorders, high MBL levels associated to disease has been reported by Hansen et al. (2003). Rheumatic fever (RF) is the most common cause of acquired valvular disease in children and young adults. The pathogenic mechanisms responsible for the development of RF/RHD are associated to an abnormal host immune response (both at humoral and cellular level) to cross-reactive streptococcal antigens. The significantly elevated circulating MBL levels in patients with RHD together with the greater prevalence of MBL deficiency in controls suggest that MBL may cause undesirable complement activation contributing to the pathogenesis of RHD (Schafranski et al. 2004). Probably, MBL deficiency may represent an advantage against the development of rheumatic mitral stenosis and that increased MBL levels may be related to the development of RHD. Under normal conditions, MBL does not bind to the organism\u2019s own tissues, but in situations of cellular hypoxia, glycosylation of cell surfaces may occur, leading to the deposition of MBL followed by complement activation. The significantly elevated levels of MBL observed in chronic RHD suggest that MBL may represent a pathogenic factor in the complex physiopathology of the disease, whereas MBL deficient individuals might be less susceptible to develop chronic RHD. Studies demonstrating the binding of MBL to the endothelium and causing excessive complement activation and subsequent tissue damage are known (Jordan et al. 2003), where as MBL deficiency may be advantageous in some circumstances since MBL may lead to an increased cytokine secretion by macrophages (Takahashi et al. 2002). Under some other conditions, MBL is associated to disease severity in both infectious and autoimmune disease (Garred et al. 1997, 1999). Although MBL is an acute-phase protein produced by the liver, its level only shows a moderate increase and determined genetically in inflammatory diseases. The elevated MBL levels in patients with chronic RHD might corroborate the chronic inflammatory activity present in these individuals and contribute to valve injury through complement activation. In addition, MBL may act as an immunomodulatory molecule, inducing a higher secretion of cytokines by macrophages (Turner and Hamvas 2000).",

For example, Kawasaki disease is a systemic vasculitis in childhood possibly caused by infections and in the developed world Kawasaki disease is the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children (Royle et al. 2005). MBL as an initiator of inflammation, Biezeveld et al. (2003) while studying the frequency of MBL genotypes with Kawasaki disease in Dutch patients found a higher frequency of MBL mutations as compared to the genotypes in controls. Children younger than 1 year were at higher risk of development of CAD. Kawasaki disease occurs more frequent in oriental children (10 times more frequent than in Caucasians) (Royle et al. 2005). In Chinese, Cheung et al. (2004) did not see a difference between the MBL genotypes of patients and controls. The recent observation of an association between a human coronavirus and Kawasaki disease (Esper et al. 2005) fits with the many indications of MBL having anti-viral activity. Plaque material may be removed from inside of the carotid artery (e.g., by endarterectomy) to avoid cerebral attack. Rugonfalvi-Kiss et al. (2005) indicated that female patients with genotypes associated with lower MBL levels had a slower rate to early restenosis, suggesting that a high level of MBL may be part of the pathophysiology of this condition.",

Normo-albuminuric type 1 diabetics have been found to have higher MBL levels than non-diabetic controls, with a stepwise increase in circulating MBL levels with increasing levels of urinary albumin excretion (Hansen et al. 2003). In another study, a significantly larger proportion of patients with diabetic nephropathy presented a MBL genotype associated with higher MBL level, when compared to the group with MBL genotypes associated with low MBL levels (Hansen et al. 2004). The elevated serum MBL levels in type 1 diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy were confirmed by Saraheimo et al. (2005). In a long follow up study on 270 type 1 diabetic patients, it was found that for patients with type 1 diabetes and MBL-levels below the median of 1.6 \u03bcg/mL the risk of developing micro or macro-albuminuria was 26%, while the patients with MBL-levels above the median had a risk of 41% of developing micro or macro-albuminuria (Hovind et al. 2005). These studies suggested that a high MBL geno- and phenotype is associated with an increased risk of developing diabetic kidney disease and that assessing MBL status may prove beneficial in identifying patients at risk for micro- and macro-vascular complications (c/r Thiel et al. 2006).",

During IRI, the patients undergoing AAA repair experience a mean decrease in plasma MBL level of 41% representing significant lectin pathway activation.

            "text": "Changes in cell surface structures during oncogenic transformation appear to promote binding of MBL to cancer cells (Hakomori 2001) where the protein can mediate cytotoxic effects including MBL-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (Ma et al. 1999; Nakagawa et al. 2003). Experimental studies suggest that MBL (both wild-type and the mutant B allele) may possess anti-colorectal cancer tumor activity (Ma et al. 1999). The MBP/MBL binds specifically to oligosaccharides expressed on the surface of human colorectal carcinoma cells, SW1116. MBL binding occurs in colon adenocarcinoma cell lines (Colo205, Colo201 and DLD-1), but not in any of the leukemic cell lines. The binding of MBL to these cell lines was sugar-specific and calcium-dependent. The degree of MBL binding was correlated with the expression of Lewis A and Lewis B antigens on these cell lines (Muto et al. 1999). Intra-tumoral administration of the recombinant vaccinia virus carrying a MBL2 gene significantly reduced tumor size as compared to controls, along with prolonged survival of mice (Ma et al. 1999). However, these results were not reflected in clinical trials. In fact, patients with colorectal cancer have increased activation of the lectin-complement pathway and increased levels of serum MBL (Ytting et al. 2004). In patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer, however, low preoperative levels of serum MBL have been linked to an increased risk of developing post-colectomy pneumonia (Ytting et al. 2005). Further studies may clarify the role of the lectin-complement pathway in colorectal cancer.",

            "text": "Secondary immunodeficiencies due to disease or treatment have provided interesting patient populations within which to study the role of MBL. One such group comprises those receiving chemotherapy for malignancy. In these patients, chemotherapy induces neutropenia and increased risk of infection. Studies have thus attempted to analyze the correlation between MBL deficiency and infections in such patients. It is difficult to compare these studies since these studies include patients with a variety of underlying malignancies and variety of chemotherapy, different combinations of antimicrobial agents and various other factors (Klein and Kilpatrick 2004). However, there is clear evidence of the importance of MBL for protection in leukemia patients. MBL genotypes and MBL levels were correlated to the causes, frequency and duration of febrile neutropenic periods in children receiving chemotherapy (Neth et al. 2001). The majority of children were patients of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Children with variant MBL alleles exhibited twice as many days of febrile neutropenia as children with wild type genotypes. Analysis by MBL quantification supported this as children with less than 1 \u03bcg MBL/mL had a higher number of days with febrile neutropenia. Peterslund et al. (2001) described infections defined as bacteremia, pneumonia or both in hematological malignancies of 54 adults treated with chemotherapy. All patients with the infections, except one, showed MBL levels below 0.5 \u03bcg/mL. Vekemans et al. (2005) conducted a prospective observational study focusing on assessment of MBL as a risk factor for infection during chemotherapy induced neutropenia in adult hematological cancer patients. They included 255 patients and determined MBL levels as well as MBL genotypes. A higher rate of severe infection was seen in MBL deficient patients. The impact was further increased when acute leukaemic patients were excluded. In a contrasting study, Bergmann et al. (2003) followed 80 adults undergoing therapy for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), which involves intense highly myelosuppressive treatment. They found no effect of MBL deficiency on frequency, severity or duration of fever and suggested that the severe immunosuppression induced by the combination of the myeloid cancer and chemotherapy may obscure the normal effector functions of MBL, though, Kilpatrick et al. (2003) failed to see anything but a modest effect of MBL levels below 100 ng/mL in a retrospective study on 128 patients, most of whom were prepared for bone marrow transfer and more than half presented with AML. Results cast doubt on the potential value of MBL replacement therapy in this clinical context (Kilpatrick et al. 2003). A growing body of evidence indicates that genetic factors are involved in an increased risk of infection. MBL gene polymorphisms that cause low levels of MBL are associated with the occurrence of major infections in patients, mainly bearing hematological malignancies, after high-dose chemotherapy (HDT) rescued by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (auto-PBSCT). A retrospective examination of 113 patients treated with HDT and auto-PBSCT revealed that the low-producing genotypes, B/B and B/LXA, were associated with major bacterial infection. A nation-wide study, conducted to assess the allele frequency of the MBL coding mutation in a total of 2,623 healthy individuals in Japan, revealed the frequency of allele B as 0.2, almost the same in seven different areas of Japan. This common occurrence suggested that MBL deficiency may play an important role in the clinical settings of immune-suppression (Horiuchi et al. 2005). Studies by Aittoniemi et al. (1999) in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia did not observe any effect of MBL on infections. A possible association between MBL genotypes and severe infections in patients with multiple myeloma receiving moderate strength induction chemotherapy has been studied. From the MBP genotypes, identified in bone marrow biopsies, the study concluded that during induction chemotherapy in patients with multiple myeloma, a general protective effect of wild-type MBL2 against chemotherapy-related infections was not apparent. However, indications were there of a reduced occurrence of septicaemia in patients with wild-type compared with variant MBL2. Further studies in larger cohorts of patients are relevant (Molle et al. 2006). Thus, further studies are required to describe the patients particularly at risk when being MBL deficient.",

            "text": "The MBL knock-out mice have made possible experimental investigations of the effect of MBL deficiency. The mouse has two genes encoding different MBL molecules (MBL-A and -C) compared to one in humans. Both MBLs in mice are able to bind to carbohydrate surfaces and activate the complement system. A slight difference in carbohydrate specificity has been reported for the two mouse MBLs. Mice with only MBL-A knocked-out were first produced, but only mice with both MBL-A and -C knocked out (MBL DKO) are suitable as animal model of human MBL deficiency. In 2004, Shi et al. demonstrated that MBL DKO sepsis model mice were highly susceptible to intravenous inoculation via tail vein with Staphylococcus aureus, all dying within 48 h, compared with 55% survival of MBL wild-type mice. Infusion of recombinant MBL reversed the phenotype. No difference was seen when the bacteria were injected intra-peritoneally. However, if the mice were treated with cyclophosphamide, simulating chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, before the intra peritoneal infection, the MBL DKO had more abscesses than the wild type. The MBL DKO mice were also more susceptible to challenge with herpes simplex virus type 2 (Gadjeva et al. 2004). In line with the suggested involvement of MBL in autoimmune diseases the MBL DKO mice were examined for autoimmune symptoms when 18-month-old (Stuart et al. 2005). No such signs were observed. On the other hand, the ability to clear apoptotic cells was less efficient in the MBL knock-outs. It has been hypothesized that while MBL does not bind significantly to healthy tissue, changes due to abnormal conditions might reveal MBL ligands. Indeed, MBL is expressed by some tumor cell lines, and gene therapy with an MBL-vaccinia construct was found protective in nude mice transplanted with a human colorectal cancer cell line (Ma et al. 1999). In vitro studies have indicated binding of MBL to cells exposed to hypoxia-reoxygenation (simulating ischemia/reperfusion) and subsequently it was shown that infusion of a blocking anti-MBL antibody would protect against myocardial destruction following ischemia/reperfusion in a rat model (Jordan et al. 2001). Using MBL DKO mice M\u00f8ller-Kristensen et al. (2005) found, in a model of kidney ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury, that the MBL DKO were partially protected as evidenced by a better kidney function in these mice after ischemia/reperfusion. Increased deposition of the complement factor C3 was seen in wild type mice, and binding of MBL to sections of kidney could be inhibited with mannose. In agreement with this, deVries et al. (2004) found MBL-A and -C deposited in the kidneys after ischemia/reperfusion in MBL wild type mice. The recombinant vaccinia virus carrying human MBP gene possesses a potent growth-inhibiting activity against human colorectal carcinoma cells transplanted in KSN nude mice. The treatment resulted into a prolonged life span of tumor-bearing mice. Local production of MBP had a cytotoxic activity, which was proposed as MBP dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (MDCC). This study offers a model for the development of an effective and specific host defense factor for cancer gene therapy (Ma et al. 1999; Thiel et al. 2006).",

Considerations of MBL genotyping and association with infection opens the possibility of producing clinical grade recombinant MBL that resulted to establishing a company having this aim (Jensenius et al. 2003). The treatment of chronic disorders may possibly also be considered on the longer term.

Six DNA polymorphisms in the MBL2 gene are known to be associated with variation in quantity and/or function of MBL in serum. Three variants affect the expression of the MBL2 gene. They are localized in the promoter 1 (position \u2212550, H/L variant and \u2212221, X/Y variant) and in the 5\u2032-untranslated region (position \u00fe4, P/Q variant) of the MBL2 gene. Three base substitutions in exon 1 in codons 52 (D), 54 (B) and 57 (C) result in amino-acid changes (arginine to cysteine, glycine to aspartic acid and glycine to glutamic acid, respectively) and decreased level and function of MBL. The normal allele is named A proteases (Reprinted by permission from Macmillan Publishers Ltd: Genes Immun. Garred et al. \u00a9 2006)",
