This was followed by reports of the illness in patients from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria 3, 6, 7. By 8 August 2014, when the WHO declared the Ebola outbreak from West Africa a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, there were 1779 reported cases with 961 deaths, and by 14 September 2014, there were 4507 probable and confirmed cases and 2296 deaths in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone 3, 5, 8, 9. The number of infected patients in the current outbreak exceeds, as of mid\u2010September 2014, the combined number of patients from all the previously known outbreaks 10. The estimated case\u2010fatality rate of this outbreak, as of late September 2014, was 70.8% 9. On 30 September 2014, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first case of Ebola virus infection to be diagnosed in the United States, in a patient who travelled from West Africa to Texas, and on 6 October 2014, the first person to have contacted the infection outside Africa was reported in a nurse from Spain, who treated two Spanish priests, both of whom died of the infection 11, 12, 13. On 24 October 2014, the first Ebola virus infection was reported in New York City, in a physician who returned from Africa, where he treated patients with the infection 14. In the USA, as of 24 October 2014, three patients were being treated, five had recovered and one died 14. The 2014 Ebola virus outbreak is the longest, largest and most persistent one on record 5, 10. One of the concerns surrounding the 2014 Ebola virus outbreak is the threat of urban spread in Africa; this is in contrast with many previous outbreaks, which occurred in rural areas from Africa near tropical rainforests, making it easier to implement timely public health responses 3, 15.",

Genetic and antigenic characterisation led to the description of five Ebola virus serotypes: Sudan (EBOV\u2010S), Zaire (EBOV\u2010Z), Tai Forest (EBOV\u2010TF), which was previously known as Cote d'Ivoire Ebola, Reston (EBOV\u2010R) and Bundibugyo (EBOV\u2010B) 17, 18, 23. The amino acid identity between Ebola viruses ranges between 55% and 81% 24. One of the seven viral proteins in filoviruses and the most abundant matrix protein, VP40, with important roles in viral assembly and budding, shows approximately 25% amino acid identity between the Ebola and Marburg viruses, supporting distinct mechanisms of cellular entry for the two viruses 24, 25, 26. EBOV\u2010TF was implicated in a single non\u2010fatal human infection, EBOV\u2010R was not been implicated in severe human infections to date, but it is highly pathogenic for non\u2010human primates, and EBOV\u2010S, EBOV\u2010Z and EBOV\u2010B were implicated in severe outbreaks 17, 18, 20, 27.",

The outbreak in Nzara is thought to have originated among workers from a cotton factory. It was reported that insectivorous bats were present in the roof space of the factory 36. The second outbreak occurred in Zaire, near the borders with Sudan and the Central African Republic, and with 318 declared victims and 284 deaths, had an 89% mortality rate 18, 40. The first person who developed the disease was a 44\u2010year\u2010old schoolteacher who presented to the Yambuku Mission Hospital on 26 September 1976 with fever and received parenteral chloroquine for suspected malaria 40, 41, 42. His fever subsided but subsequently reappeared together with other signs and symptoms, including gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient was admitted on 5 September, died on 8 September and is considered the index case of the outbreak. While travelling during the preceding weeks, he had purchased and eaten antelope meat. Almost all patients who subsequently developed Ebola haemorrhagic fever during this outbreak either received injections at the same hospital or were close contacts of patients who received injections. At the Yambuku General Hospital, it was reported that five syringes and needles were distributed every morning, and were usually rinsed in a pan of warm water between their uses on different patients and sometimes, at the end of the day, they were boiled 40. Eventually, 55 of the 250 neighbouring villages in the area, all within 120 km from Yambuku, reported patients.",

In November 1994, three researchers dissected the body of a chimpanzee they found in the Ta\u00ef National Park, C\u00f4te D'Ivoire 43, 44. One of them, a 34\u2010year\u2010old woman, became sick 8 days later. She took halofantrine, and as there was no improvement in her condition, with malaria being suspected, she was admitted to a local hospital and treated with intravenous quinine. After several days she was repatriated to Switzerland, where her condition improved and she was discharged. Interestingly, this patient did not develop haemorrhagic signs. Ebola virus was identified from chimpanzee tissues, and it was later shown that the patient was infected with Ebola virus. The human disease was preceded, between October and December 1994, by the observation that about 25% of the 43 members of a wild chimpanzee community disappeared or were found dead in the Ta\u00ef National Park 43. The high mortality rate among apes indicated that they are probably not the reservoir for the virus, but probably become infected from a common reservoir that also infects humans. Before the outbreak, the chimpanzee group was reported to have fed on a fig tree. Fruit bats are the most important dispersers of the fig tree's seeds, and some of them are known to fly kilometres in search of a tree with ripe figs 45, 46. This became the first example in Africa when a human became infected with Ebola from a naturally infected non\u2010human primate 47.",

Initially, inhabitants from three gold\u2010panning encampments, M\u00e9kouka, Andock and Mink\u00e9b\u00e9, became sick and travelled to a hospital in Makokou for treatment. Deaths were also reported within the local populations of gorillas and chimpanzees 48, 49. There was a report from a patient who reported having had to kill a chimpanzee that exhibited abnormal behaviour. More cases were reported in January 1995 18. The second outbreak began in early February 1996 in the Mayibout II village, about 40 km south of Mekouka. It started with 18 children who helped butcher and carry a chimpanzee they found in the forest, and subsequently became ill. Eventually they spread the disease to two neighbouring villages, Mayibout I to the south and Mvadi to the north. Overall, the outbreak caused disease in 31 people, 21 (67.7%) of whom died 18. The third outbreak is thought to have started in July 1996 with the death of a hunter living near the village of Boou\u00e9 49, 50, 51. In early August, several chimpanzees were reported to have died in the same area. A second hunter died in the same region in late August, and 12 days later a third hunter became sick, was hospitalized, but left the hospital against medical advice and died in the village of Balimba, where he was treated by a natural healer. In mid\u2010September, the traditional healer and his nephew became sick with similar symptoms, were admitted to Boou\u00e9 Hospital and subsequently to the Makokou General Hospital, and died there soon thereafter. In late October, a physician who performed an endoscopy to an infected patient in Boou\u00e9 developed disease and travelled to Johannesburg for treatment. The South African nurse who cared for him became sick and died 18, 49.",

In January 1995, a charcoal miner from Kikwit died of Ebola, followed 2\u20133 weeks later by the death of several family members, who had become infected during the burial rituals. Patients presented haemorrhagic diarrhoea, initially thought to be caused by Shigella infections; as a result, Ebola remained undiagnosed for several months 54. The outbreak lasted for 7 months, and involved 316 individuals with suspected infection, 252 of whom died 52. During the Kikwit outbreak, healthcare workers experienced the highest rate of infections, with physicians more likely to become infected (31%) than technicians (11%) and nurses (10%) 55. Epidemiological investigations revealed that direct contact with a sick person and exposure to body fluids such as blood, stool or vomit conferred a heightened risk; being an adult, exposure to patients in the late stages of the infection, or having touched a dead body were additional risk factors 52.",

Half of the patients usually develop a maculopapular rash on the trunk and shoulders that is usually noticed by days 5\u20137 of the disease and is often followed by erythema and desquamation 38, 68, 73. Early in the second week there is a dramatic worsening, with vascular involvement and coagulopathy or improvement 18, 24, 73. The disease is characterised by multisystemic involvement that includes respiratory, vascular, gastrointestinal, neurological and haematologic manifestations 16, 68. The severe manifestations of the disease are thought to be the result of three main factors: rapid viral replication, host immune suppression and vascular dysfunction 16. Death usually occurs because of multi\u2010organ failure and shock; metabolic disturbances occur in late stages, along with diffuse coagulopathy 38, 68, 73. Case\u2010fatality rates are 60\u201390% with EBOV\u2010Z and 40\u201360% with EBOV\u2010S 18, 68.

For a pathogen to be able to successfully become established in a population, the value of R0 has to be over 1 76, 77. The value of R0, which varies for different infectious diseases and across populations for the same infectious disease, provides a quantitative measure of the efforts that are needed to prevent an outbreak or to eliminate it once it has started in a population 75. Using mathematical modelling, it was estimated that the basic reproduction number was 2.7 (95% CI: 1.9\u20132.8) for the 1995 Ebola virus outbreak from the DRC and 2.7 (95% CI: 2.5\u20134.1) for the 2000 outbreak from Uganda 74. This analysis found, for the two epidemics, an estimated R0 for transmission during traditional burial of 1.8 and 0.1, respectively, showing that transmission as a result of funeral practices had a more important contribution during the first outbreak and transmission in the community a more important contribution during the second outbreak. This suggested that in these two outbreaks, community, hospitals and burial ceremonies played different roles in the transmission of the virus in the population 74.",

The possibility that bats are a reservoir for the virus is also supported by many studies on the Marburg virus. An ecological investigation in the Python Cave, Uganda, where a Dutch female visitor became infected with the Marburg virus in 2008, and where over 40,000 Rousettus aegyptiacus bats are present, revealed that of 1622 bats captured and tested between August 2008 and November 2009, 2.5% were infected with the Marburg virus, based on Q\u2010RT\u2010PCR on samples from the liver and the spleen, and infection was present in the lung, kidney, colon and reproductive tissues, indicating that the virus could be spread by aerosols, urine, faeces and sexually 89. In 2009, Marburg virus was detected for the first time in the tissues, in addition to viral RNA and antibodies in the sera, in apparently healthy Egyptian fruit bats caught in the Kitaka cave in western Uganda where in 2007 an outbreak occurred among workers mining for lead and gold 90. This represented the first time when filoviral antigens were detected in naturally occurring bats 90.",

Bats, also known as \u2018flying foxes\u2019, the only known flying mammals in the world, and among the most ancient of the mammals, inhabit all continents except Antarctica, and represent almost 25% of the recognised mammal species 95, 96, 97, 98. Bats live on average 3.5\u2010times longer than a mammal of similar size, promoting the persistence of the virus in the host and increasing the likelihood of transmission 95, 99, 100. This, along with other characteristics, such as bat migration and their population structure and migration patterns, make them particularly suitable reservoirs for viruses 97. Bats host a significantly higher number of viruses per species as compared into rodents, emerging as unique sources of zoonotic infection 101. They have been implicated in several recent viral outbreaks, including the rabies viruses, the SARS coronavirus, Nipah and Hendra viruses, Rift Valley fever virus, reoviruses and lyssaviruses, and in 2008 it was reported that 85 different viruses have been isolated from or detected in bat tissues 95, 97, 98, 100.",

Observations on infected patients and experiments on non\u2010human primates point towards several transmission routes, which include blood borne transmission, direct contact with infected patients or body fluids, fomites and possibly aerosolisation 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110. During the 1976 outbreaks from Sudan and Zaire, reusing contaminated needles played an important role 36, 40. In the 1995 Kikwit outbreak, contact with an ill person, exposure to body fluids, touching a deceased person and exposure during the late hospital phases emerged as risk factors 104. An analysis of the 2000\u20132001 outbreak from Gulu, Uganda that used culturing and reverse\u2010transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed that the Ebola virus is present in the saliva, semen, stool, breast milk and nasal blood 111. Contact with body fluids emerged as the strongest risk factor, but multivariate analyses suggested that having washed the clothes of a sick person, or having participated in the ritual hand washing during the funeral ceremony, did not appear to be risk factors 103.",

This transmission route is facilitated by the stability of filoviruses in aerosols 113. In cynomolgus, rhesus and African green monkeys infected with aerosolised EBOV\u2010Z, the virus was first detected in the blood 3 days after the challenge. While the LD50 (median lethal dose) was very low (less than 10 plaque\u2010forming units) and comparable viral titres were detected in the three species, a number of differences were observed. The time to death was different from one species to another but very consistent among individuals from the same species, and the petechial rash was seen on cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys, but not on African green monkeys, after the onset of fever 110. Ebola virus transmission was reported to two of three rhesus monkeys that did not come in direct contact with experimentally inoculated monkeys that were being held in the same room 102. When virus\u2010containing droplets were administered into the respiratory tract of rhesus monkeys via inhalation, as little as 400 plaque\u2010forming units of virus were sufficient to cause fatal disease within 4\u20135 days after onset of clinical signs, and with the exception of the bleeding from subcutaneous and puncture sites and the nasal discharge, the disease was clinically identical to the one that can be seen after parenteral inoculation of the virus 109. In most instances, the pathology seen after aerosol infection on non\u2010human primates with Marburg or Ebola viruses has been reported to be the same as that seen after parenteral inoculation, the exception being EBOV\u2010S, which caused a viral pneumonia in cynomolgus macaques after inhalation 114.",

Subsequently, a study that exposed 5\u2010week\u2010old pigs to a porcine isolate of the 2008 virus by drops into the nostrils and throat and by subcutaneous injection revealed that the virus was able to establish subclinical infection by both routes. Without showing clinical disease, the animals were able to shed the virus via the nasopharynx and, in some instances, via the faecal route 115. In the first experimental interspecies transmission, 4\u2010week\u2010old piglets inoculated oro\u2010nasally with EBOV\u2010Z were able to transmit the virus to cynomolgus macaques without direct contact. Based on the experimental setting, the virus could have been be transmitted by aerosols, droplets or fomites because of droplets or, possibly, droplets generated while cleaning the rooms, and the evidence suggested that under conditions resembling the ones from the farm, pigs can transmit the infection to non\u2010human primates 81. However, there are no documented examples of respiratory transmission of Ebola virus among humans or non\u2010human primates, and aerosol transmission has occurred only under experimental conditions or when other factors, such as fomites or the cleaning of the rooms, could not be ruled out 81, 109. Also, it is important to note that in all human outbreaks studied to date (with the exception of the current one, for which sufficient data are not yet available), the use of standard barrier nursing procedures was able to effectively halt the outbreaks in the hospital settings, and this observation practically rules out aerosol transmission as a major concern for human Ebola virus transmission 68, 74, 104, 116, 117.

Among the most challenging aspects related to the biology of the Ebola virus are identifying the reservoir and understanding the routes of transmission. From observations and studies on previous outbreaks, it appears that in different outbreaks, transmission in different settings contributed to varying degrees to the overall transmission. In the absence of approved therapeutics or vaccines, supportive therapy is currently the most important aspect of disease management. Better understanding the biology of the Ebola virus, transmission from the reservoir to other hosts and to humans, and the dynamics of viral transmission in the population, will play key roles in helping design better prophylactic and therapeutic approaches.",
