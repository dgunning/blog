By May 2014, it had been identified in 29 of the contiguous states (Hennessy, 2014). PEDV is an enveloped, RNA coronavirus (Pan et al., 2012; Song and Park, 2012; Huang et al., 2013) that causes morbidity in pigs of all ages but is most fatal to preweaned pigs. Transmission of PEDV is mainly through the fecal\u2013oral route, but many different modes of transmission are possible through either direct or indirect contact (Sun et al., 2012; Geiger and Connor, 2013). While PEDV is not a new swine disease globally, the April 2013 occurrence represented the first time the disease was identified within the United States, and prospective impacts of the disease were unclear.",

There is still much that is not known about PEDV. This holds at least as much for economic impacts as for other aspects of PEDV. Hence, the assessment to be presented here is more demonstrative than definitive. The U.S. hog market was certainly impacted by changes in input prices reflecting weather shocks, trade policy, meat demand, and macroeconomic factors that are not attributable to PEDV. Still, using economic theory and intuition and available data, the article assesses the economic impacts in broad terms, providing a conceptual framework of the economic influence of PEDV.",

Furthermore, the project provides a PEDV epidemic threshold given the seasonality in the outbreak of coronaviruses. This project showed an increase in the number of PEDV cases in June 2013 and an even more dramatic increase that started in September 2013 (Fig. 1). The number of new cases of PEDV as tracked in the Swine Monitoring Project was then above epidemic threshold levels through June 2014. For illustrative purposes, the \u201cyear of PEDV\u201d for inventory impacts was deemed September 2013 through August 2014, which allows comparisons across USDA Hogs and Pigs reports. Over 50% of sow farms tracked in the Swine Health Monitoring Project had new outbreaks during the \u201cyear of PEDV\u201d (UM SDEC, 2014).",

Annual inventory changes in the \u201cyear of PEDV\u201d were estimated from USDA Hogs and Pigs reports. This report, issued four times yearly, presents data on the U.S. pig crop for 16 major states and the United States, including inventory number by class, weight group, farrowings, and farrowing intentions (USDA NASS, 2015a). The number of sows farrowing in the United States was slightly smaller (28,000 sows) in September 2013 through August 2014 compared to September 2012 through August 2013. However, the combined year-over-year reduction in the number of sows farrowing (\u22120.25%) pales in comparison to the reduction (\u22123.03%) in pigs saved per litter. Given that PEDV is a disease marked by death loss among young pigs through weaning age, the 0.31 decrease in the number of pigs saved per litter was the primary contributor to the reduced pig crop. The U.S. pig crop was estimated to be 112,476,000 based on a summation of the quarterly pig crop estimates from September 2013 through August 2014. This estimate of the U.S. pig crop was 3,725,000 head or 3.21% smaller than compared to the September 2012 through August 2013 period.",

As part of the USDA Hogs and Pigs report, producers are asked their farrowing levels for the previous quarter and farrowing intentions over the next 2 quarters. Farrowing intentions are a primary indicator of U.S. hog supplies (Diersen, 2004). These intentions can be compared to actual farrowing levels from the previous quarter or year to identify general trends in supply. Sows farrowing during the \u201cyear of PEDV\u201d (September 2013 through August 2014) were below the first and second intentions, except for the June\u2013August 2014 quarter (Fig. 2). The decline in sows farrowing despite strong incentives to expand may have been a result of PEDV's effect on gilt retention and an overall tight supply of market hogs. Generally, pigs are slaughtered about 6 mo or 2 quarters after being farrowed. Thus, fewer hogs were expected to be marketed in March\u2013May 2014 and the following 2 quarters than had earlier been anticipated. The level of intentions and actual sows farrowing for the June\u2013August quarter indicated producers were likely adjusting to price signals and production capabilities as PEDV was beginning to be mitigated in the national herd.",

The main implication of this is that 2014 profit levels were expected to lead swine producers to \u201cbid away\u201d margins in the form of buying or retaining replacement females or both to expand their herd, or making capital investments to increase herd capacity, etc. These adjustments, in time, are expected to return the breeding herd sector to more typical levels of profitability, increasing breeding inventories in the process.",

In 2014, pork demand increased 7.4%, which was the second-largest annual gain since 1990. Pork demand is measured in terms of inflation-adjusted value of per capita pork consumption. While per capita consumption fell by 0.83% in 2014, pork prices increased 10.29% over that time (Tonsor, 2015). The price increase had been enough to more than offset the quantity reduction and allowed overall pork inflation-adjusted values to climb, which in turn increased hog prices and improved the overall economic situation of hog producers.",

A farrow-to-finish enterprise budget model that specified the mathematical relationships between production inputs and outputs, as well as the costs and revenues associated with production, was developed. The model captures the major relationships between productivity metrics, market pig prices, and input prices, making it possible to vary different market pig or feed prices, for example, to determine how they change the impact of PEDV on the profitability of the enterprise. To avoid the effect of operation-to-operation variation, constant standard reference values for capital expenditures and variable input prices not directly affected by PEDV were used in the budgeting model.",

Paarlberg (2014) estimates pork packers experience reductions in annual returns of $481 million following a 3% reduction in pigs from PEDV and $929 million if supplies fall by 6%. Pork consumers who experience reduced-supply-induced pork-price increases are harmed directly (e.g., their pork costs more) but also indirectly as prices of competing meats (e.g., beef and poultry) are also strengthened by PEDV. Paarlberg (2014) suggests annual consumer surplus declines by $300 million to $600 million depending on the volume of supply reductions. The impact on producers is diverse and complicated as demonstrated throughout this article. This point is reinforced by Paarlberg (2014), who notes losses to infected producers are smaller than gains to uninfected producers leading to the \u201csurprising outcome\u201d of a net gain for producers in aggregate.",
