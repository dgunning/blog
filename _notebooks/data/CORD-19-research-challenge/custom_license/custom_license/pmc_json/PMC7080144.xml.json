During the last decade, public health authorities in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) estimated that there have been 100,000 human cases of pesticide poisonings in China per year (Wu and Liu 2000). This large figure is no doubt due in part simply to China\u2019s very large rural population, and because a significant percentage of its people are engaged in the agricultural sector. It is nonetheless alarming that rodenticides may alone be responsible for up to 70,000 annual poisonings in China. What is more, according to one Beijing-based medical journal, a substantial portion of recent rodenticide poisonings in China have been deliberate (Qiu et al. 2002), in many cases involving the use of a relatively novel rodenticide, tetramethylene disulfotetramine, (tetramine, C4H8N4O4S2; CAS no. 80-12-6). The 2002 case described below is among the more recent and striking examples.",

            "text": "Tetramine falls into a category of cyclic compounds noted for their high toxicity in mammals (Esser et al. 1991). Tetramine acts directly upon the brain itself, blocking the chloride channel of the inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor of \u03b3-amino butyric acid (GABA). Very small amounts of tetramine, estimated as low as 0.1 mg/kg weight (oral LD50) in mammals can lead to convulsions and death, with 7.0\u201310.0 mg/kg dosages considered lethal in humans (Guan et al. 1993); the minimum lethal dose for humans has been estimated at about 5.0 mg/kg. The effects of tetramine can manifest themselves quickly, from about 30 minutes to a few hours following ingestion (Tang et al. 2000). Symptoms of tetramine poisoning include fainting, epileptic seizures, incontinence, and foaming at the mouth. Data compiled from laboratory animal studies are also instructive. One Chinese medical journal described tetramine poisoning in mice the following way: \u201cAfter ingesting the bait, mice are poisoned acutely. They are excited. Their tails straightened. They jump around, and occasionally screamed. It is followed by periodic or continuous spastic convulsion. Their limbs become stiff. In some cases, this cycle repeats a few times. Then, they die.\u201d (Zhou et al. 1998). Clinical and anecdotal reports from the PRC also noted hemoptysis among some victims of tetramine poisoning, but this symptom and its relationship to the toxicity of tetramine have not yet been satisfactorily explained.",

It was later revealed that a fellow student\u2014who had compiled a long record of truancy\u2014was responsible. The student, angry that the school had informed his father of his unsavory behavior, tried to take revenge on his teacher by scattering tetramine on vegetables in the commissary during after-school hours. Reportedly, the student purchased a pouch of tetramine rodenticide for the equivalent of US$ 0.16. (1 yuan). Although the miscreant intended to poison only the teacher, the tainted ingredients were unwittingly used by the kitchen staff and served throughout the school population (Wang 2002).In August 2002, Mr. Zhong Dongxiang of Tongchuan City, Shaanxi Province, plotted to kill his wife so he could marry his mistress from Xi\u2019an, and he purchased some tetramine on the open market. After at least one failed attempt, on 3 October he managed to kill her by poisoning milk that was being regularly delivered to their residence. In the process of doing so, however, he also managed to poison 15 others in the building (presumably due to secondary contamination). As a result of this event, about a ton of milk had to be discarded for fear of further contact with the rodenticide.On 26 September 2002, five people died from tetramine poisoning due to the actions of a 17-year-old \u201cfarm girl\u201d in Xi\u2019an. Reportedly, the young woman admitted to having poisoned food with tetramine at the restaurant where she worked because her boss had held back her pay (Ma 2002).On 10 November 2002, in Anqing City, Anhui Province, Mr. Jiang Xingyou decided to poison the food of a competing restaurant that he felt was stealing away his customers. At informal open markets he purchased tetramine in the form of a rodenticide, and he subsequently adulterated food at the rival eatery\u2014several times. Although it is not known how many people eventually fell ill, two workers at the restaurant died as a result of tetramine poisoning (AFP Hong Kong 2002).For reasons that included his own failing preschool that he managed\u2014and constant fighting with his wife\u2014Mr. Huang Hu (30) apparently took out his frustrations at a rival school by using tetramine. In the evening of 24 November 2002, Huang snuck into the Kangle (\u201cHappy Health\u201d) No. 2 Kindergarten, and adulterated the table salt in the kitchen. As a result, 70 children and two teachers were poisoned. Chinese authorities claimed Huang later made a full confession (Jian and Zhan 2002).\n",

This fact, coupled with the very low cost of the final product (starting at US$ 0.10 per unit) makes it easy for the average Chinese citizen to gain access to very toxic substances, including acutely toxic rodenticides such as fluoroacetate, fluoroacetamide, tetramine, and possibly others.",

During the spring and summer of that year, acting upon what was later described as \u201csuperstitious influence,\u201d Du Runqiong (42) and her son Tang Youhua (20), used these rodenticides to poison and kill 18 people. These individuals used both rodenticides to contaminate rice, vegetable plots, and sausages sold in the local market. Their crimes also extended to their neighbors\u2019 livestock, causing the death of 243 pigs, some 3,100 chickens, and 10 oxen. During the investigation of this rather sordid affair, researchers from the China Medical Research Institute of Preventative Medicine were dispatched to Gaoyao City, and toxicologists from the Peoples\u2019 Liberation Army (PLA) finally identified the poisons from locally obtained samples. Until Du Runqiong was apprehended in November 1995, many of the Gaoyao City\u2019s inhabitants, fearing for their lives, panicked and fled the township. On 22 December 1995 both perpetrators were sentenced to death.",

Obtaining chemical precursors (ingredients for production) and the synthesis of these compounds are relatively easy.\nHigh profitability. Unscrupulous vendors can double their money by selling a rodenticide like tetramine, where 1 g of pure substance costs about 1 yuan to manufacture, and 1 g of rodenticide fetches about 2 yuan on the open market.\nClandestine manufacture and sales. According to one Chinese account, \u201cMotivated by profits, some rodenticide producers are secretly but clearly producing these rodenticides with tacit approval of the state, some individual entities are doing so without permission. Some are illicit shops, taking very toxic rodenticides and masking them as slow [anticoagulant] poisons or renaming them with monikers such as Sanbudao, \u201cMiraculous Rodenticide\u201d, and other trade names for sale on the market.\nRegional protectionism. Corrupt local government officials allow the continued production of banned rodenticides, knowing that they can benefit from increased tax revenues as well as bribes.\nWeak regulatory enforcement. While the PRC\u2019s Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Crop Protection have investigative authority, they have no means to levy punishments on violators. Conversely, \u201cthe Chinese Department of Market Management has the authority to take punitive measures, but lacks the technical means to test for the highly toxic rodenticides.\u201d (Fan 2002).\n",
