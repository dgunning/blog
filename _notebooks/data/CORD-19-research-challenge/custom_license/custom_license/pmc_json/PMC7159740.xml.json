But a population must constantly interact with and adapt to these other organisms if it is to survive and reproduce. Food species, predators, and agents of infectious disease have all played a role in human evolution, and among the latter, viruses were probably particularly important. As significant causes of morbidity and mortality, and in their capacity to act as \u201cmolecular genetic parasites\u201d (Luria, 1959), viruses are in a strong position to influence the evolution of their hosts (May, 1995; Villarreal, 1999; Balter, 2000). While this is well\u2010recognized in studies of the evolution of other organisms (especially plants, e.g., Thompson and Burdon, 1992; Simms, 1996), the impact of infectious disease on human evolution has not received the attention it deserves (Swedlund, 2000). Yet viral parasites have probably played an important role in human evolution (de Souza Leal and Zanotto, 2000). The purpose of this paper is to review recent work in the molecular genetics of human viruses and to assess the extent to which viruses were significant parasites of earlier hominids (and thus in a position to have affected human evolution before the Neolithic). It also speculates on the roles they may have played.",

A disease that kills or lowers fertility is a likely selective agent. It can be an advantage or a disadvantage to a species in competition with others, even contributing to extinction. Most species contain considerable genetic diversity in their resistance against disease, and considering the speed with which new pathogens evolve (in general much faster than the host), it is in the best interests of the host to be genetically diverse and highly mutable in the loci concerned with disease resistance. In the view of Haldane (1949), disease may even favor speciation, by coupling this diversity and mutability with geographic isolation. In addition, transmission requirements may have contributed to host population size and structure and behavioral characteristics such as negative reaction to fecal odors.",

Estimates of the proportion of polymorphic loci ranged from 20\u201340% in vertebrates and about 30% in humans (Selander et al., 1970). Some suggested that interactions between parasites and hosts played an important role in maintaining this degree of polymorphism (Clarke, 1976). Hamilton et al. (1990) suggested that the need for genetic diversity in a \u201chost\u2010pathogen arms race\u201d even contributed to the evolution of sexual reproduction. We now know that this level of polymorphism (30%) is probably an underestimate, based on incomplete sampling of rare mutations. Given the frequency of DNA polymorphism (about one in every 500 nucleotides), nearly all genes may be polymorphic (Cavalli\u2010Sforza et al., 1994). The human genome is now estimated to contain between two and three million single\u2010nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and even though less than 1% are estimated to result in variation in proteins, this still leaves enough to involve many more than 30% of the estimated 20,000\u201330,000 human genes (International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2003; Venter et al., 2003).",

The importance of maintaining this first line of defense against invading pathogens is emphasized by the discovery that some polymorphic alleles in the MHC system predate the divergence between chimpanzees and humans, and have been transmitted through speciation bottlenecks via \u201ctrans\u2010species selection\u201d (Takahata, 1990). While such positive selection is still believed to have maintained many MHC allelic lineages, the sharing of MHC polymorphisms by different mammalian orders and even some within the primates (e.g., between humans and New World monkeys) may be the result of convergent evolution (Yeager and Hughes, 1999; Kriener et al., 2000).",

The impact of parasitism before that time was not considered very important, as it appeared to be restricted to chronic latent infections unlikely to cause serious disease and the occasional zoonosis (disease of another animal species). Meanwhile, the influence of disease on human affairs since the Neolithic was acknowledged to have been considerable (McNeill, 1976). Humans were assumed to have had few viral diseases before the Neolithic (Burnet and White, 1972), but studies of antibodies in isolated South American tribes suggested that small isolated groups had their share of infections (Neel et al., 1964, 1968; Black, 1975), and Cockburn (1967a) recognized the presence of many viruses in wild primates and thus, probably, in our ancestors.

Deep phylogenetic branches, high genetic diversity, global distributions, and trees showing cospeciation with primate hosts all suggest ancient association of many viruses with humans, while close relationships with viruses infecting other species (especially rodents and domesticates) suggest more recent acquisition of others. The ease with which our species acquires emerging infections from other primates points to the importance of these zoonoses as a source of human disease, both now and in the past. When mapping the evolutionary relationships of human and animal viruses, one obtains a different picture depending on whether the viruses in question are DNA\u2010based, RNA\u2010based, or replicated using reverse transcriptase, so these types are discussed separately.",

All except the Parvoviridae have double\u2010stranded DNA genomes, like the cells they infect. This similarity in structure and replication gives DNA viruses a very intimate molecular relationship with their hosts, especially viruses that replicate in the nucleus, which are capable of recombination with host genomes and horizontal gene transfer (Morse, 1994; Villarreal, 1999). DNA viruses tend to be more species\u2010specific, with narrower host ranges than RNA viruses. Mutation rates are slower than those of RNA viruses, on the order of only 10\u2013100 times as fast as host rates. Many have adopted a \u201cpersistent life strategy\u201d whereby the virus increases fitness by increasing the survival time of its offspring, thus increasing probability of transmission. This strategy results in chronic, latent infections with long periods of infectivity and the ability to persist in small host populations (although \u201cpersistent\u201d refers to persistence in an individual host; Villarreal, 1999). DNA viruses thus tend to be stabler and older than RNA viruses, and their phylogenies often show a pattern of cospeciation with their hosts.",

Viral evolutionary rates are not constant, and even if they were, high mutation rates lead to underestimation of genetic distances due to homoplasies, reversions, and multiple substitutions at a single site (Brown, 1994). This is particularly problematic for rapidly mutating RNA viruses (more below), but must also be a concern when estimating timescales for the deeper branches on DNA viral trees (McGeoch and Davison, 1995; McGeoch et al., 1995).

These large, complex DNA viruses have mutation rates comparable to those of cellular DNA. Observed mutation rates for alphaherpesviruses are compatible with estimated rates based on cospeciation with their hosts, so assumption of a fairly constant molecular clock appears warranted for this group (McGeoch and Davison, 1995). A robust phylogeny of 48 viruses has been constructed, using amino\u2010acid sequences of eight viral genes and maximum\u2010likelihood evaluation of sets of candidate trees to create composite trees (for details of the method, see McGeoch et al., 2000).

The family split into three branches with different tissue tropisms (alpha\u2010, beta\u2010, and gammaherpesviruses) around the time that mammals diverged from reptiles. Each branch further subdivided into at least two major sublineages before the mammalian radiation of 60\u201380 mya and subsequently cospeciated with their hosts (McGeoch et al., 1995). Alphaherpesviruses show a tight correlation with phylogenies of primates, ungulates, and carnivores, while betaherpesviruses cospeciated with primates and rodents, although few sequences and hosts are as yet known for the group containing HHV\u20106 and HHV\u20107 (McGeoch et al., 2000). Similarly, we need more data on other primate viruses in the gamma\u20101 sublineage containing Epstein\u2010Barr virus, but the gamma\u20102 sublineage contains many viruses that have cospeciated with primates (McGeoch, 2001).

As the type 1 alphaherpesviruses of nonhuman primates infect both oral and genital tissues without any differentiation into separate strains, this suggests microbiological isolation of the two body areas in the hominid line. Some have proposed changes in sexual behavior as an explanation, with continual female sexual attractiveness and adoption of face\u2010to\u2010face mating in the line leading to hominids (Gentry et al., 1988). It might reflect increased distance between these two areas with the adoption of bipedalism, although 8 mya is a bit too early, even considering the recent discovery of a 6\u20137\u2010million\u2010year\u2010old putative hominid (Brunet et al., 2002), and 8 mya for the divergence of the two HSV types is likely to be an underestimate. Like several other viruses able to persist in small populations, HSV\u20101 is most commonly acquired in early childhood, from mother to infant via infected saliva. HSV\u20102 is usually acquired in adulthood through sexual contact, and both viruses can be transmitted by the oral\u2010genital or oral\u2010anal route (Benenson, 1995). Perhaps there were changes in social behavior and gestures that resulted in less frequent oral\u2010genital and oral\u2010anal contact, especially between mother and infant. Related viruses in African apes remain to be discovered, and further reflection on this point should probably wait until we know whether they indeed lack different oral and genital strains.",

This family of very small DNA viruses makes maximal use of minimal genomes by using overlapping reading frames on both DNA strands, thus putting a selective constraint on its ability to mutate and resulting in slow rates of evolution, on the same order as cellular DNA (Chan et al., 1992; Hatwell and Sharp, 2000). It contains two genera, Papillomavirus and Polyomavirus, which infect a wide variety of vertebrates and are highly species\u2010specific. Figure 3 shows the relationships of a few of the many viruses in this family. Again one sees deep branches with different tissue tropisms and long\u2010term cospeciation with hosts. While nonhuman primate viruses cluster with human viruses according to tissue tropism rather than phylogeny of the host, within these tropic subgroups, viral relationships mirror host phylogeny (Van Ranst et al., 1995). The high degree of species and type diversity within this family suggests a well\u2010adapted pathogen that has been closely associated with its hosts for a long time (Chan et al., 1992). Molecular clock estimates are not as robust for these viruses, however, as most have not been as intensively studied as the herpesviruses.",

While poxviruses appear to be an ancient family that evolved along with its nonhuman hosts (Fenner and Kerr, 1994), smallpox virus, or variola (genus Orthopoxvirus), was probably acquired recently by humans, perhaps during the Neolithic, as it follows an acute strategy in humans (short\u2010lived, virulent infection in virtually all individuals it infects). It infects only humans, however, so its source is unclear. Its closest relatives are camelpox, gerbilpox, and monkeypox, the latter maintained in a rodent reservoir, in spite of its name (Douglas and Dumbell, 1996). Figure 6 shows some likely relationships among members of this family, but these ultimately depend on where in the genome one looks (Blasco, 1995). The world's remaining stocks of variola have been restricted since the 1970s to two research centers in the US and Russia, so the phylogeny of this virus is not as well\u2010studied, although researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sequenced 10 strains and found that these sequences were highly conserved (Stone, 2002). Because camelpox and variola are very species\u2010specific and incapable of causing infection in the other host, and because the genome of monkeypox is quite different from that of variola, Fenner et al. (1988) did not believe either of these was the source of the human virus, but that it descended from a \u201cprotovariola\u201d that followed a more persistent strategy in earlier hominids and became more virulent when human populations increased. On the other hand, the close relationship to gerbilpox suggests another possibility: a zoonotic rodent virus in Africa that evolved into variola only after human populations became large enough to support it (Tucker, 2001). Another poxvirus, molluscum contagiosum (genus Molluscipoxvirus), appears to be an ancient, persistent hominid infection (Senkevich et al., 1997).",

Their replication is more error\u2010prone, with high base substitution rates by viral enzymes that typically lack proof\u2010reading ability, on the order of 104\u2013106 times the rates for DNA viruses and cellular genomes (Simmonds, 2001). Mutation rates are even greater for retroviruses, whose reverse transcriptases operate close to the error catastrophe threshold, the level of critical\u2010copying fidelity below which information can no longer be maintained and the nucleotide sequences of viral RNA would become essentially random (Domingo and Holland, 1994). Fast mutation rates help keep RNA viruses fairly small, as larger genomes could not sustain these rates of change and still remain capable of replicating. Many RNA viruses also undergo frequent recombination via \u201ccopy\u2010choice\u201d (in which the RNA polymerase switches templates during replication), and those with segmented genomes (e.g., influenza) can reassort (Morse, 1994). All this results in a sort of \u201cmodular\u201d evolution for these viruses and much faster rates of evolution than those of DNA viruses (Holland, 1993; Domingo and Holland, 1994) (recombination also occurs in DNA viruses, but via \u201cbreakage and reunion\u201d as in host\u2010cell genomes, and it is less frequent than among RNA viruses). RNA viruses thus have a frightening ability to evolve and adapt to new hosts, and also to increase in virulence. They are less species\u2010specific and are readily transmitted between species; almost all viral zoonoses and \u201cemerging\u201d viruses are RNA viruses (Morse, 1993; Woolhouse et al., 2001).",

It is estimated that every possible single nucleotide polymorphism can be found in an HIV\u2010infected individual (Wain\u2010Hobson, 1994; Overbaugh and Bangham, 2001). Considering that RNA viruses may have been among the earliest organisms to evolve (Gorbalenya, 1995), they have explored enormous evolutionary spaces since then. At the other extreme, stabilizing selection in a well\u2010adapted and long\u2010standing natural host can result in persistence of an average or consensus genome sequence through time, with \u201cpersistence\u201d here meaning maintenance in nature by the continuous infection of susceptible host organisms (Morse, 1994; Domingo et al., 1998). But freed from this stabilizing selection, or when single mutant genomes escape to a new host, these same RNA viruses are capable of rapid evolution and often increased virulence as well (Morse, 1994; Kilbourne, 1994; Domingo et al., 1998). While some can cause persistent inapparent infections in natural reservoir hosts, most follow an \u201cacute life strategy\u201d (rather like r\u2010selection), in which the virus increases fitness by increasing its reproductive rate (Villarreal, 1999). The ability to infect multiple species helps, as do means of transmission that do not require host fitness, such as water\u2010 and vector\u2010borne transmission (Ewald, 1994; Woolhouse et al., 2001).",

Rotaviruses are ubiquitous in nature and are found in both animals and plants. They are probably old viruses and might have afflicted some of our hominid ancestors. Evidence of this, however, has been overwritten by the tendency of these viruses to be shared by multiple host species. In addition, rotaviruses contain segmented genomes that frequently reassort when an individual is coinfected by multiple strains, making tree interpretation very difficult, and different genes give different trees (Joklik and Roner, 1995). Analysis of a number of structural and nonstructural proteins all show close relationships among human, bovine, and swine rotaviruses, with evidence of frequent interspecies exchanges (Goral et al., 1996; Kojima et al., 1996; Cunliffe et al., 1997; Tang et al., 1997). Figure 7B shows one of these trees, for the major capsid protein (Tang et al., 1997). While earlier hominids may have suffered from some form of rotaviral infection, they were probably sporadic and zoonotic.

These are the ultimate source of epidemic and pandemic influenza in humans, with pigs being an intermediate host (Webster, 1997, 1998; Kawaoka et al.. 1998). The production of many new human strains has been traced to pig\u2010duck\u2010fish farming in Asia, where the use of duck fecal material as fish food leads to transmission of avian influenza to pigs, and transmission to humans follows via the respiratory route (Scholtissek and Naylor, 1988). Like rotaviruses, influenza A has segmented RNA that can reassort, and interspecies transmission is frequently associated with reassortment among avian, swine, and human viral genes (Webster, 1997, 1998), a process known as \u201cantigenic shift.\u201d This creates new viruses sufficiently different to overcome immunity gained by past experience with influenza virus, and results in a strain with pandemic potential. Once in a new host species (unlike in the avian reservoir), the virus is under intense selection pressure to outwit the host immune response through mutations resulting in amino\u2010acid substitutions, or \u201cantigenic drift.\u201d Selection pressure is especially focused on the viral hemagglutinin (HA), a surface protein that binds to sialic acids on the new host's cell surfaces, and is often the target of immune surveillance (Bush et al., 1999). Drift probably occurs in other viral infections of respiratory or enteric mucous surfaces in long\u2010lived vertebrates, because the presence of antibodies on those surfaces means strong selection for even minor antigenic novelty (Fenner et al., 1974, p. 627\u2013630).",

The clade containing foot\u2010and\u2010mouth disease and encephalomyocarditis is considered the mostly nonhuman animal side of the tree (Doherty et al., 1999). Simian enteroviruses (isolated so far from macaques, guenons, and baboons) are as diverse and probably as numerous as human enteroviruses. Many of these are the closest known relatives of human enteroviruses (with the exception of viruses derived from human strains, e.g., swine vesicular disease virus, thought to have originated from coxsackie B; Poyry et al., 1999), while other simian viruses cluster together and probably represent a previously unknown picornavirus genus (Oberste et al., 2002). There are more than 60 human enteroviral serotypes, including 3 polio, 23 Coxsackie A, 6 Coxsackie B, and 30 echoviruses. They are common in humans, and most of them cause no apparent infection. A high proportion (>99%) of polio infections are subclinical as well, and the virus was endemic in developing countries of Asia, Africa, and the Americas until recently (Rico\u2010Hesse et al., 1987; polio has now been largely eradicated everywhere except sub\u2010Saharan Africa and India, thanks to WHO's Global Polio Eradication Initiative; World Health Organization, 2001). The neuropathogenicity of wild polio is low and requires spread of the virus from the intestinal tract to motor neurons (Crainic and Kew, 1993). Poliovirus may persist in the organism and continue to be shed after acute infection (Domingo et al., 1998), allowing it to be maintained in small isolated populations, although Black (1990) thought that poliovirus was introduced into South American Indians. Wild polio type 1 strains (the most common cause of polio) correlate better with geography than with time of isolation, meaning that viruses isolated at different times in a single geographic region are more closely related to one another than are polioviruses from several regions isolated in the same year (as would be found in the case of pandemic influenza, for example). This argues for the relative stability of this virus, with strains from Africa and the Mideast having the deepest roots (Rico\u2010Hesse et al., 1987). It further suggests that enteroviruses, including poliovirus, have long been associated with hominids, either coevolving with us or possibly entering our line from other primates sometime during our evolution in Africa.",

The woolly monkey virus is still closest to the South American human type F; that and the existence of the only other known mammalian hepadnaviruses in American rodents (e.g., woodchucks, squirrels) still suggest to some an American origin by cross\u2010species transmission. Others have proposed that HBV coevolved with humans and diversified as they migrated from Africa during the last 100,000 years (Magnius and Norder, 1995). But the viral phylogeny does not parallel genetic relationships between human and nonhuman primate hosts, which presents a problem for any coevolutionary model. A third scenario involves multiple zoonotic transmissions, analogous to what some believe has happened with HIV (see below), with donor species remaining unidentified (MacDonald et al., 2000). Recent zoonotic transmission is not supported by the separation of human and ape clusters, however, as one would expect in that case to see a mosaic branching pattern of human and ape strains (Verschoor et al., 2001). The latest and perhaps best explanation of this confusing picture is that primate HBVs cospeciated with their hosts (both woolly monkey and apes) over the last 10\u201335 my (which leads to a very low estimate of mutation rate, by the way, but similar to that obtained if cospeciation is assumed for rodent and woolly monkey viruses), with human strains being of ancient zoonotic origin (sometime before leaving Africa), perhaps via processing of primates for food (Simmonds, 2001). Since that time, dispersal from Africa and rapid population growth (providing more opportunities for horizontal transmission) led to faster mutation rates and diversification of the human virus (Robertson and Margolis, 2002). This last hypothesis fails to account for the close relationship between South American HBV and the woolly monkey virus, however, unless one assumes multiple zoonotic origins.

These integrated viruses also escape immune detection and the resulting pressure to evolve, making them much more stable than exogenous viruses. Retroviruses that tend to integrate, like human T\u2010cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV), are thus characterized by slower rates of change and less sequence diversity, while viruses that produce continual rounds of replication using the viral polymerase, like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), have more genetically diverse populations and faster rates of evolution (Overbaugh and Bangham, 2001). \u201cEndogenous retroviruses,\u201d presumed remnants of ancient germ\u2010cell infections, are integrated proviruses that have lost the ability to produce infectious particles.

The human immunodeficiency viruses most likely originated through recent interspecies transmissions, from chimpanzees in the case of HIV\u20101 (Gao et al., 1999; Corbet et al., 2000), and from sooty mangabeys for HIV\u20102 (Chen et al., 1997; for reviews, see Holmes, 2001; Sharp et al., 2001). It is now clear that HIV\u20102, a less pathogenic virus endemic in West Africa, emerged in that region where mangabeys are both hunted and kept as pets, and at least four separate interspecies transmission events gave rise to six human subtypes (Chen et al., 1997).",

            "text": "The origins of HIV\u20101 are less clear, but there appear to have been multiple cross\u2010species transmissions of SIVcpz to humans in west central Africa (Gao et al., 1999; Sharp et al., 1999; Hahn et al., 2000). This conclusion is still somewhat tentative, however, as it is based on only six captive chimps (Zimmer, 2001). SIV prevalence in chimpanzees, both wild and captive, is low (Corbet et al., 2000; Santiago et al., 2002). In contrast, both African green monkeys and sooty mangabeys are infected by their respective viruses at high frequencies (Hahn et al., 2000). It should be noted, however, that wild P.t. troglodytes, the suspected source of HIV\u20101, has not yet been adequately sampled. SIVcpz from P.t. schweinfurthii is quite divergent from HIV (Santiago et al., 2002), and it was not found at all in 387 P.t. verus from West Africa (Prince et al., 2002). The only case of SIV infection in Nigerian P.t. vellerosus was in an animal caged with an infected P.t. troglodytes (Corbet et al., 2000), so SIVcpz of P.t. troglodytes seems the most likely HIV\u20101 ancestor. That chimp and human viruses are interspersed on the tree shown in Figure 13 suggests that there have been at least three cross\u2010species transmissions, most likely related to the practice of hunting and field\u2010dressing chimpanzees for \u201cbush meat\u201d (Hahn et al., 2000). Indeed, there is a high potential for acquiring primate viruses in this manner, as recent sampling showed a substantial proportion (\u223c20%) of wild monkeys hunted or kept as pets in Cameroon to be SIV\u2010infected (Peeters et al., 2002).",

The virus apparently remained undetected for 50 years or more in low\u2010risk populations before spreading to high\u2010risk groups, through cultural practices affecting contact with infected blood or sexual frequency which increased the potential for transmission (Armelagos et al., 1990).

Both HTLV\u2010I and \u2010II are older retroviruses than HIV, and have evolved more slowly because of their greater tendency to integrate into the cellular genome and consequent potential for vertical transmission. This leads to mostly inapparent lifelong infections like those caused by DNA viruses. On the other hand, the tendency of HTLV\u2010I to jump species barriers can lead to rapid viral evolution, as in other retroviruses. Because of this difference, HTLV\u2010I and HTLV\u2010II have contrasting evolutionary histories (Fig. 14; Slattery et al., 1999; Salemi et al., 2000). HTLV\u2010I appears to have originated in Asia between 50\u2013100 kya, moved to Africa where it explosively spread through Central African anthropoids (including humans) with many occasions of interspecies transmission, and eventually spread as a \u201ccosmopolitan\u201d variant to the rest of the world (Vandamme et al., 1998; Van Dooren et al., 2001). Geographic variants of HTLV\u2010I thus reflect recent migrations of anatomically modern humans (Slattery et al., 1999). HTLV\u2010II, on the other hand, is an older virus with an African origin \u223c400 kya; its closest relative is the simian T\u2010cell lymphotropic virus (STLV) of Pan paniscus (Vandamme et al., 2000). Today there are two types of distribution for both HTLV\u2010I and \u2010II: a cosmopolitan epidemic associated with transmission via contaminated blood or needles, and an endemic pattern produced by mother\u2010to\u2010child transmission (via breast milk), with substrains reflecting human migrations (Black, 1997), but both types I and II originated through interspecies transmission of STLVs to human ancestors (Salemi et al., 2000).",

            "text": "What can we conclude from this survey of the molecular phylogenies of viruses, and what does it imply about the role of viruses in human evolution? 1Most of the slowly evolving DNA viruses are ancient and have coevolved in close association with their hosts. Families such as the Herpesviridae, Papovaviridae, and Adenoviridae have cospeciated with vertebrates, and even the earliest hominids undoubtedly had their share. The life\u2010long, mostly asymptomatic infections caused by these viruses are unlikely to have had a significant selective effect, however, unless introduced into a new host.2Many RNA viruses, with their enormous capacity for change, were more recently acquired during the Neolithic, when humans and domesticated animals entered into intimate contact, and agricultural surpluses and permanent housing attracted disease\u2010carrying rodents. This process was facilitated by RNA viruses' high mutation rates, propensity for interspecies transmission, and ability to recombine or reassort when related viruses coinfect the same host (e.g., mammalian and avian influenza viruses in pigs). Post\u2010Neolithic viruses include the diarrheal calici\u2010 and rotaviruses, the coronaviruses of common colds, and ortho\u2010 (influenza) and paramyxoviruses that cause a variety of other respiratory diseases. The DNA\u2010based smallpox virus may also be in this category. The generally more acute infections caused by these newer viruses are unlikely to have plagued earlier hominids. At the same time, the existence of RNA viruses in wild primates suggests that hominids had some of these, but the transient nature of these continually drifting viral genomes means that their sequences have been totally overwritten, and their propensity to switch hosts means their descendants may be anywhere. The trail on these is quite cold.3On the other hand, the capacity of some RNA viruses to be evolutionarily stable in long\u2010standing reservoir hosts, and other constraints on their ability to evolve, suggest that some of these may be very old human parasites. Hepatitis viruses, picornaviruses, and HTLV became endemic in hominids some time before modern humans left Africa; some of these may have infected the earliest hominids. But like the DNA viruses, these are unlikely to have acted as important agents of selection, given their association with mostly chronic and latent infections, although this may not have been the case in the past. When these viruses were first acquired they were probably more virulent, and different hominid species may have had different susceptibilities. Considering the array of retroviruses found in African monkeys and apes today and the ease with which they cross species barriers, ancient humans may have encountered more than just HTLV. Endogenous retroviruses, moreover, with their ability to retrotranspose into different parts of the host genome, may have played a more direct role in human evolution.4Zoonoses, or infectious diseases whose natural hosts are other animals, must have been important causes of disease throughout human evolution (Fenner et al., 1974, p. 632). Because viruses that must be able to replicate efficiently in more than one host are more genetically stable (Kilbourne, 1994; Scott et al., 1994), arboviruses such as yellow fever, dengue, and Rift Valley fever have probably been present in Africa during much of our evolution, and mosquitoes capable of transmitting them evolved during the Pliocene (Capasso, 1993). Bat lyssaviruses, from which rabies is derived, also have a long history in Africa (Bourhy et al., 1993). Given the diversity of tropical ecosystems, African environments are bound to have contained numerous zoonotic viruses capable of infecting hominids. Scavenging or hunting other species, including primates, would have presented constant opportunities for the transmission of viruses.\n",

In spite of the lower probability of inheritable change in sexually reproducing animals, there are now several examples of host\u2010pathogen coevolution in animals, probably due to selection acting on preexisting variation. A well\u2010studied example is the introduction of myxoma virus (a natural parasite of American rabbits) into Australian rabbits in the 1950s. The initially very high mortality rates declined over several years, and investigations showed that both rabbits and virus had changed.

Changes in cell surface receptor sites may facilitate the binding of viruses with altered coat proteins. Viral proteins may mimic host antigens and thereby escape immune surveillance in most individuals; hosts with rare antigenic types would have an advantage. Many viruses wrap themselves in a host cell membrane on their way out of the infected cell. Upon attacking another individual of a different antigenic type, the new host will respond with antibodies against the antigens picked up from the previous host. Under these conditions, a population with greater heterogeneity in cell surface antigens makes it harder for enveloped viruses to find a tolerant host, and this may have been important in promoting MHC diversity (Bodmer, 1972). Enveloped viruses include most of the RNA viruses (among the DNA viruses, herpesviruses pick up bits of nuclear membrane, and poxviruses snatch proteins from Golgi bodies).",

This means that zoonoses, in spite of their potential for dramatic consequences, are unlikely to lead to lasting selective effects; their role was probably limited to keeping hominids from exploiting certain microenvironments. And while some viruses encountered by hominids may have been fatal, the ones for which they were a frequent host could not have been too serious (or they would not have persisted in small populations), certainly not to the extent required for strong selection pressure.",

The relative dearth of known resistance factors to any kind of pathogen reinforces this conclusion.

Considering the range of environments Pliocene hominids probably exploited (Potts, 1998), they were likely to encounter a wide variety of viruses with the potential for interspecies transmission. The tendency for multiple infectious agents to share receptor sites (Baranowski et al., 2001) means that viruses may also have acted in concert with other pathogens to influence the evolution of cell surface properties. In this regard, the recent discovery that humans lack N\u2010glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), a sialic acid receptor used by several viruses and other pathogens, is interesting (Varki, 2001; the possible inhibiting effect of Neu5Gc on brain development may also have contributed to selection against this receptor in hominids). Viruses that bind to Neu5Gc include some corona\u2010, rota\u2010, and influenza viruses, which explains why some strains (e.g., avian influenza; Webster, 1997) are not infectious in humans. Neu5Gc is not found in Neandertal fossils; the enzyme that produces it was inactivated in the human line by an Alu insertion estimated to have occurred 2.7\u20132.8 mya (Chou et al., 2002). It is tempting to link this with the behavioral shift to more meat\u2010eating in hominids, which would have increased their exposure to the viral families we now share with our domesticates and which are just the highly mutable agents that bind to sialic acids.",

Homozygous individuals have nearly complete resistance to HIV infection, while heterozygotes experience delayed onset of symptoms (Stephens et al., 1998).

With the use of coalescence theory to analyze the linkage disequilibrium between it and two microsatellite loci, the delta32 mutation has been dated to around 700 years ago, about the time of the 14th century Black Death in Europe, suggesting that the mutant allele may also confer some resistance to the plague (Stephens et al., 1998).

There would have been strong selective pressure against any reduction in the ability to resist infection (Svanborg\u2010Eden and Levin, 1990). The MHC, also known in humans as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex, is the most highly polymorphic genetic system in mammals. These antigens are present on cell surfaces, and bind foreign antigen fragments for presentation to T\u2010lymphocyte receptors. MHC diversity results from meiotic recombination facilitated by high levels of heterozygosity; diversity in B\u2010cells and in T\u2010cell receptors is generated by somatic recombination, clonal selection, and higher than normal mutation rates, mechanisms thought to have evolved under pressure from parasites (Sarkar, 1992; Knapp, 2002). Balancing selection in the form of immune reactions between mother and fetus and negative assortative mating may be involved in maintaining MHC heterozygosity (Black and Hedrick, 1997; Ober, 1999; Penn and Potts, 1999; Wedekind and Penn, 2000); viral infection may also contribute. In mice, individuals infected with mouse hepatitis virus produce even more MHC heterozygotes (Rulicke et al., 1998). Descendants of Dutch colonists in Surinam who survived 19th century epidemics of typhoid and yellow fevers (with combined mortality \u223c60%) have significantly higher heterogeneity at an MHC locus and others involved in control of the immune response than did a Dutch control sample (deVries et al., 1979). Individuals with high MHC heterozygosity have enhanced resistance to multiple parasites, while variation among individuals (favored by the presence of more alleles in a population) limits transmission of rapidly evolving viruses (Black, 1992). MHC mating preferences may produce a \u201cmoving target\u201d against rapidly evolving parasites that would otherwise escape immune recognition (Penn and Potts, 1999). A clear correlation between MHC polymorphism and selection by infectious disease is difficult to prove, however, and other explanations of MHC\u2010dependent mate preferences include the need to avoid inbreeding (Penn and Potts, 1999; Wedekind and Penn, 2000).",

Reflecting the great antiquity of retroviruses and retroid elements, these endogenous retroviruses are found in all eukaryotes, and reverse transcriptase may have been involved in the earliest phases of life (McClure, 1995). They appear to have been especially active during primate evolution. Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), remnants of ancient germ\u2010cell infections occurring 5\u201350 mya, make up about 1% of the human genome (Wilkinson et al., 1994; L\u00f6wer et al., 1996; Johnson and Coffin, 1999; Sverdlov, 1998). A number of HERV families are estimated to have integrated at different times and from different exogenous viruses (Table 2). They are not as common in platyrrhines as in catarrhines, and therefore most are estimated to be \u223c30\u201340 million years old (Costas and Naveira, 2000). Highly expressed in placental tissue and certain tumors, some of these sequences result in pathological conditions such as autoimmune disease, leukemia, and other cancers (Wilkinson et al., 1994; Weiss et al., 1999), while others are involved in the regulation of host gene expression, placental formation, and immunosuppression during pregnancy (Table 2). An especially well\u2010studied example of HERV genetic effects is the tissue\u2010specific expression of salivary and pancreatic amylases, mediated by insertion of an endogenous retrovirus into the amylase gene (Fig. 15; Samuelson et al., 1990; Ting et al., 1992).",

These uniquely human proviruses and solitary long terminal repeats (LTRs) may have played a role in hominid evolution (Lebedev et al., 2000). HERV\u2010K LTRs are capable of affecting the expression of nearby genes (L\u00f6wer et al., 1996; Baust et al., 2000). They contain potential hormone response elements, enhancers, promoters, polyadenylation signals, and transcription factor binding sites that could be involved in the regulation of adjacent genes if inserted in an appropriate context (Sverdlov, 2000). HERV\u2010K LTRs can bind host\u2010cell nuclear proteins and have the potential to activate neighboring genes (Akopov et al., 1998). They can act as switches for alternative splicing (e.g., alternate forms of the leptin receptor) and therefore be involved in transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression (Kapitonov and Jurka, 1999). Some HERV\u2010K proviral genes are expressed in humans (Barbulescu et al., 1999).",

Parasite\u2010mediated competition might have resulted from viruses carried by humans (herpes simplex, HTLV, hepatitis, polio, and rhinoviruses), and differential susceptibility to zoonoses emergent in an environment both populations were using (e.g., rabies), or agents carried along in comigrating animals (dogs?) and arthropods (e.g., mosquito\u2010borne flaviviruses) could hasten the demise of already foundering populations.

That the two sides were of the same species helped keep the conquered populations from total extinction (although not the Tasmanians or some American tribes); interbreeding may have helped save the outcompeted populations.
