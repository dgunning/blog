            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly contagious disease of chickens affecting the respiratory, renal, and reproductive systems. The IB was described as early as 1931 in North Dakota, USA. Since then, the IB virus (IBV) is circulating in different parts of the world with several IBV serotypes that led the IB control and prevention problem to persist (Fabricant, 1998). Though the disease affects chickens of all ages, the clinical disease is more severe in young birds with high mortalities (Cavanagh, 2005). The secondary bacterial infections and/or other respiratory pathogens have been reported to exaggerate both clinical outcome and mortality during IBV infections (Haghighat-Jahromi et al., 2008; Hassan et al., 2016, 2017).",

The clinical signs of the IBV infection vary depending on the tissue tropism and the pathogenicity. Clinical signs include coughing, sneezing, tracheal rales, and watery eyes. Lesions in infected birds include degeneration of renal and ciliated respiratory epithelia (Cavanagh, 2007). The IBV epidemiology in Egypt reported the circulation of the virus in poultry flocks with continuous evolution despite massive vaccination programs. Different strains similar to Massachusetts, D3128, D274, D08880, and 793B are frequently isolated from Egyptian poultry (Abdel-Moneim et al., 2006; Abdel-Moneim et al., 2012; Zanaty et al., 2016).",

The continuous mutation and recombination events and the emergence of novel IBV variants urge researchers to establish a simple phylogeny-based classification system.

However, the continuous genetic, antigenic, and tissue tropism changes of the circulating IBV caused continual vaccine failure events (Cook et al., 2012). IBV vaccines are based on live attenuated or killed vaccines derived from classical or variant serotypes. In Egypt, Mass-type and variant (e.g., 4/91 and CR88) vaccine strains were employed to provide broader protection in poultry. However, the uniqueness of the WT IBV lineage in the Middle East (Valastro et al., 2016) and the lack of cross protection between imported vaccine strains and field strains may explain the failure to establish an effective vaccination program against IBV (Kim et al., 2013; Toro et al., 2015).",

Recent studies highlighted the importance of depending on both quantification of ciliostasis and detection of viral shedding for the evaluation of protection levels afforded by the IBV vaccine candidates (Bande et al., 2015).",

Moreover, a significant reduction of the virus shedding titers was observed in the vaccinated birds at 3 DPI and no virus was detected at 5 and 7 DPI. These findings indicate that the attenuated viruses are suitable vaccine candidates that can provide protection against the challenge with homologous strains.",
