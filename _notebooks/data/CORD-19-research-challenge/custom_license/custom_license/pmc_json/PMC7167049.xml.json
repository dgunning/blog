They can infect respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and central nervous system of human, livestock, birds, bat, mouse, and many other wild animals.\n1\n, \n2\n, \n3\n The outbreaks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002/2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 have demonstrated the possibility of animal\u2010to\u2010human and human\u2010to\u2010human transmission of newly emerging CoVs.\n4\n, \n5\n An outbreak of mystery pneumonia in Wuhan since December 2019 has been drawing tremendous attention around the world. Chinese government and researchers have been taking swift measures to control the outbreak and conduct the etiological studies. The causative agent of the mystery pneumonia has been identified as a novel coronavirus (nCoV) by deep sequencing and etiological investigations by at least five independent laboratories of China (http://virological.org/ and https://www.gisaid.org/). On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization temporarily named the new virus as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019\u2010nCoV). The sporadic emergence and outbreaks of new types of CoVs remind us that CoVs are a severe global health threat. It is highly likely that new CoV outbreaks are unavoidable in the future due to changes of the climate and ecology, and the increased interactions of human with animals. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop effective therapies and vaccines against CoVs.",

The genome of CoVs is a single\u2010stranded positive\u2010sense RNA (+ssRNA) (~30 kb) with 5\u2032\u2010cap structure and 3\u2032\u2010poly\u2010A tail. The genomic RNA is used as template to directly translate polyprotein 1a/1ab (pp1a/pp1ab), which encodes nonstructural proteins (nsps) to form the replication\u2010transcription complex (RTC) in a double\u2010membrane vesicles (DMVs).\n6\n Subsequently, a nested set of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) are synthesized by RTC in a manner of discontinuous transcription.\n7\n These subgenomic messenger RNAs (mRNAs) possess common 5\u2032\u2010leader and 3\u2032\u2010terminal sequences. Transcription termination and subsequent acquisition of a leader RNA occurs at transcription regulatory sequences, located between open reading frames (ORFs). These minus\u2010strand sgRNAs serve as the templates for the production of subgenomic mRNAs.\n8\n, \n9\n\n",

The first ORFs (ORF1a/b), about two\u2010thirds of the whole genome length, encode 16 nsps (nsp1\u201016), except Gammacoronavirus that lacks nsp1. There is a \u22121 frameshift between ORF1a and ORF1b, leading to production of two polypeptides: pp1a and pp1ab. These polypeptides are processed by virally encoded chymotrypsin\u2010like protease (3CLpro) or main protease (Mpro) and one or two papain\u2010like protease into 16 nsps.\n10\n, \n11\n Other ORFs on the one\u2010third of the genome near the 3\u2032\u2010terminus encodes at least four main structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Besides these four main structural proteins, different CoVs encode special structural and accessory proteins, such as HE protein, 3a/b protein, and 4a/b protein (Figure 1B, lower panel). All the structural and accessory proteins are translated from the sgRNAs of CoVs.\n7\n\n",

Since the mutation rates in the replication of RNA viruses are much higher than that of DNA viruses, the genomes of RNA viruses are usually less than 10 kb in length. However, the CoV genome is much larger, with roughly 30 kb in length, the largest known RNA viruses. The maintenance of such a large genome of CoVs may be related to the special features of the CoV RTC, which contains several RNA processing enzymes such as the 3\u2032\u20105\u2032 exoribonuclease of nsp14. The 3\u2032\u20105\u2032 exoribonuclease is unique to CoVs among all RNA viruses, probably providing a proofreading function of the RTC.\n12\n, \n13\n, \n14\n Sequence analysis shows that the 2019\u2010nCoV possesses a typical genome structure of CoV and belongs to the cluster of betacoronaviruses that includes Bat\u2010SARS\u2010like (SL)\u2010ZC45, Bat\u2010SL ZXC21, SARS\u2010CoV, and MERS\u2010CoV.

As the Wuhan seafood market also sells other animals, the natural host of 2019\u2010nCoV awaits to be identified. Due to the possibility of transmission from animal to human, CoVs in livestock and other animals including bats and wild animals sold in the market should be constantly monitored. In addition, more and more evidence indicate the new virus 2019\u2010nCoV is spread via the route of human\u2010to\u2010human transmission because there are infections of people who did not visit Wuhan but had close contact with family members who had visited Wuhan and got infected (http://www.cctv.com/).",
