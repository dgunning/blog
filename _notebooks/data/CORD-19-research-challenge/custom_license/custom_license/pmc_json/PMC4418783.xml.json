Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Infants were enrolled within 72 hours of birth, before discharge from hospital. Infants attended scheduled follow-up visits at 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12 months of age. In HCMC, infants had 2 additional follow-up visits at 1 and 3 months of age. At each visit, data was collected on any illness episodes since the last routine visit. Infants were enrolled from July 1, 2009 to Dec 31, 2013 in HCMC and August 1, 2009 to Dec 31, 2012 in Dong Thap; this analysis is based on the subset of the infant cohort who had reached 12 months of age on or before August 31, 2011.",

We did not attempt to merge these data with the ARI episodes detected through clinic-based surveillance, rather analyzed them as a separate alternative endpoint. The second was data on admissions to 3 hospitals in HCMC (Hospital for Tropical Diseases, District 8 Hospital and Children\u2019s Hospital 1) and the provincial hospital in Dong Thap, on all infants under 1 year of age resident in our catchment districts, within the study period. These are the hospitals to which cohort infants are most likely to be admitted. Using name, date of birth and address, we matched these hospital datasets to our enrolment data to identify admissions of cohort infants that had been missed through our clinic-based surveillance, and classified ARI episodes on the basis of the ICD10 code (codes J00\u2013J22 were included). These additional ARI admissions were merged with our existing dataset, and all analyses of hospitalized ARI relate to this merged dataset, unless specified otherwise.",

Although the observation-time was evenly distributed across calendar months (see Fig. A, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/INF/C70), the age-structure of the infants under observation did vary considerably across calendar months (see Fig. B, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/INF/C70) likely due to monthly fluctuations in enrolment rate and the restriction of this dataset to only those infants enrolled during the first 14 months of the study. We therefore calculated ARI incidence stratified by age group (\u22646 or >6 months) and calendar quarter, overall and for the 6 most common pathogens. A weighted ARI incidence estimate for all-cause ARI was calculated by combining the stratum-specific estimates, weighted by stratum-specific observation times. Weighted pathogen-specific incidence estimates could not be calculated because the total number of infections for most viruses was too small to stratify by study site as well as age-group and season, and it was not informative to combine 2 sites with such different ARI incidences.",

These estimates are subject to the limitation of case ascertainment, discussed further below, which partly explains the differences between study sites and means that these will be underestimates of the true virus-specific incidence. This extrapolation furthermore assumes a similar pathogen distribution among the ARI episodes from which no specimen was available [293/2885 (10%) of outpatient ARI and 172/236 (73%) of inpatient ARI episodes] as among those specimens tested. An interaction between the time-varying age-distribution of infants under observation and the seasonality of the viruses could conceivably have biased these estimates in either direction, but we were not able to weight the incidence estimates to adjust for this due to very small counts of pathogen-specific infections in many strata when stratifying by study site, inpatient/outpatient, age group and calendar quarter. Nonetheless, these data illustrate the high rates of respiratory virus infection experienced by infants during their first year of life, especially in the semi-rural cohort. The estimated incidence of influenza virus-associated ARI in our Dong Thap cohort is very similar to an infant cohort in rural India8 where cases were actively detected through household visits, and 1.5- to threefold higher than reported from a clinic-based study in the US.12 Our estimates of RSV-associated ARI hospitalizations in the semi-rural cohort are also very similar to those from a community-based cohort in Kenya9 and a clinic-based study in the US,12 although the overall incidence of RSV in our study was substantially lower than reported from the Kenyan cohort or the rural Indian cohort.",

            "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first birth cohort study in tropical Southeast Asia including surveillance for infectious diseases, and its strengths lie in its longitudinal population-based design, large sample size from both urban and semi-rural settings, and linkage between sociodemographic, clinical and laboratory data. There are however some limitations. First, our ascertainment of acute illness episodes was passive and consequently incomplete, particularly in HCMC, as compared with self-reported episodes or with hospital admission records. This is likely due to the abundance of health care providers in the city that families might use in preference to our study clinic. As a result, it is highly likely that the incidence of ARI in the HCMC cohort was considerably underestimated. The ARI incidence in our semi-rural cohort was also somewhat lower that has been reported in other studies where active case detection was employed,10 indicating that our passive clinic-based case detection might have resulted in some under-ascertainment also in the semi-rural cohort. Second, the study population was drawn from women delivering at one large hospital in each study site, who may not constitute a representative cross-section of the catchment population. Third, the great majority of infants were \u226537 weeks gestation and therefore we cannot generalize our observations to preterm babies, who may be at higher risk for ARI during infancy.28\u201330 Fourth, the detection of respiratory viruses by PCR in ARI patients does not necessarily imply a causative role. Rhinovirus and coronavirus have been detected frequently also in the nasopharynx of asymptomatic children;27,31\u201335 however, RSV and influenza viruses are rarely detected in healthy controls,31,34,35 suggesting these pathogens are causally linked to the ARI episode. Finally, bacterial pathogens are known to be contributors to ARI in young children36,37 but were not investigated in this study due to logistical and financial constraints.",

Such age-specific data on the incidence and viral etiology of ARI in infants can inform efforts for the development and implementation of infant and maternal vaccines and other interventions to reduce ARI incidence and hospitalization rates for infants, particularly in semi-rural and rural settings.",
