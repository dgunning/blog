For example, the HIV\u20101 protein p6, which contains the late domain involved in virus budding, was determined to be a phosphoprotein phosphorylated by multiple kinases 11. Further analysis identified a specific phosphosite (Thr23) that was phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo by the MAPK, ERK\u20102 12. When Thr23 was mutated to an alanine (thus blocking phosphorylation of the site) within the virus, the mutant showed reduced infectivity as well as defective viral particle maturation and budding 12. Further work is necessary to determine more precisely how exactly the Thr23 phosphorylation is leading to the observed effects on the virus, but this example highlights the ability of phosphorylation at a specific site on a viral protein to impact a viral life cycle. As a caveat, when performing mutational analyses, it is important to ensure that the non\u2010phosphorylatable mutant protein is stably expressed to similar levels as the wild\u2010type protein to more clearly associate phenotypic effects to the absence of a specific phosphorylation.",

A number of kinases, including CKI and CKII, phosphorylate the HCV NS5A protein and contribute to NS5A's hyperphosphorylated form 15, 16, although in this specific case, CKI and CKII phosphorylate different sites within NS5A. Although both of these phosphorylations may be involved in transitioning the viral protein from genome replication to particle assembly, the sites are distinct 16. Although the aforementioned in vitro data are helpful in the preliminary identification of kinases, in vivo experiments must also be performed to determine if multiple kinases are in fact phosphorylating a viral protein in an infected cell. By utilizing multiple kinases to phosphorylate a viral protein, a virus could have the ability to expand its host and cellular tropism and infect different species and cell types with varying kinase profiles. Additionally, kinase redundancy provides multiple opportunities for a viral protein to be phosphorylated, ensuring the chance for the phosphorylated protein to induce pathogenic effects on the cell. Examples of kinase redundancy exist for a number of viruses, including poxviruses 17, 18, 19 and Ebola virus 20. Vaccinia virus is phosphorylated by members of both the Src and Abl kinase families 21, and these kinases are involved in viral particle release 17. Inhibiting either the Src or Abl family does not block viral release, but inhibiting both kinase families strongly inhibits the release of viral particles in cell culture 17, 19. This example of kinase redundancy illustrates how the presence of one kinase or family of kinases may be sufficient to induce a virus' pathogenic effect, even in the absence of the other kinases utilized by the virus. Kinase redundancy must also be considered when designing and using kinase inhibitors, because inhibitors are not necessarily entirely specific for one kinase or kinase family. For example, Sprycel acts on both Src and Abl cellular kinase families and has a more profound effect in cell culture than an inhibitor that only affects Abl. In the mouse though, this less specific inhibition may not be helpful, as will be discussed later 17.",

Table 1, however, is not based on tissue data. Variable expression of kinases in different tissues could affect which kinase(s) phosphorylate proteins from different viruses, depending on which tissue(s) are infected by a particular virus. There have been no systematic evaluations of which cellular kinases are most central to different viral life cycles.

Viral kinases may also phosphorylate other viral proteins and/or be autophosphorylated 30, potentially affecting viral replication or production within the cell. The EBV\u2010encoded protein kinase BGLF4 is able to phosphorylate a number of viral proteins, including Epstein Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA\u20102) 31, 32, 33, 34. EBNA\u20102, a transcriptional regulator, is hyperphosphorylated during mitosis by cdk1 during the virus' latent phase 35. The viral kinase BGLF4 also phosphorylates EBNA\u20102, in a manner similar to the cellular kinase cdk1, during the lytic phase 34. This hyperphosphorylation of EBNA\u20102 inhibits EBNA\u20102's normal ability to transactivate the EBV LMP1 promoter; the regulation of the LMP1 promoter via BGLF4's EBNA\u20102 phosphorylation may induce the continuation of EBV's lytic replication cycle 34.

Phosphorylation of a cellular kinase can also influence its interaction with other proteins \u2014 for example, tyrosine phosphorylation of specific residues within Src\u2010family kinases is required for Src's interaction with proteins' SH2 domains 42, 43, 44. In Table 1, rotavirus NSP5 45, HCMV UL97 46, EBV BGLF4 47, and HSV\u20101 UL13 48 have all displayed an ability to autophosphorylate, although the full effects of these autophosphorylations on protein activity remain under investigation. As reviewed in Michel and Mertens 49, HCMV UL97 is autophosphorylated, but there are conflicting data regarding the role of this autophosphorylation in UL97's ability to phosphorylate and interact with other proteins. It is not definitively known whether autophosphorylation of viral kinases will induce the same effect(s), such as regulating catalytic activity and recruiting proteins for interaction, as autophosphorylation of cellular kinases. Evidence comparing the autophosphorylation of a specific site between homologous cellular and viral (Rous sarcoma virus) Src kinases suggests that the effects of a specific autophosphorylation could differ between even related cellular and viral kinases 39, 50.

However, viral amino acid sequences that differ from canonical kinase recognition sites may impact the ability of current programs to predict phosphorylation and specific kinase recognition sites. Eichwald et al. 59 determined that CKI is capable of phosphorylating rotavirus NSP5 at its Ser67 residue. Ser67 lacks a phosphorylated residue at the \u22123 position and a string of three to four acidic residues, so the Ser67 phosphorylation site deviates from the ideal CKI recognition site 57. As such, neither NetPhosK nor Scansite programs recognize Ser67 as a potential phosphorylation site, let alone a site able to be phosphorylated by CKI. Likewise, the vaccinia virus A36R protein is able to be phosphorylated at Tyr112 by both Src and Abl tyrosine kinases 21. However, the Tyr112 site does not sit within a canonical Abl kinase recognition site, as it lacks a proline or phenylalanine at the +3 position. Both NetPhosK and Scansite predicted that only Src would phosphorylate A36R Tyr112. In another example of kinase recognition site variation among related viruses, protein kinase G (PKG) phosphorylates DENV NS5 protein 60, YFV NS5, and WNV NS5 61 at two sites that both differ substantially from the canonical PKG substrate sequence, R\u2010K\u2010R\u2010K\u2010S/T 62. The flaviviral PKG sites additionally differ from each other, with no clear motif to be identified from these viral substrates (Figure 1). Curiously, while DENV Thr449 and YFV Ser450 sites are both phosphorylated by PKG within the same C\u2010X\u2010T/S\u2010C motif 60, NetPhosK analysis does not predict any Thr449 phosphorylation in DENV NS5 but correctly predicts a PKG phosphorylation of Ser450 in YFV NS5. It is possible that kinases may bind substrates in sites distant from the recognition motif where phosphorylation occurs. These distant binding sites may be important for phosphorylation of a substrate by a specific kinase.",

Despite the variations from known recognition sequences and/or phosphorylation prediction analyses, biochemical and cell culture data suggest that all of the sites discussed earlier can be phosphorylated by the kinases in question. Thus, although programs such as these provide a good starting point for studying phosphorylation of a viral protein, one must use caution when predicting phosphorylation patterns and the kinases involved in phosphorylating viral substrates as there can be substantial differences between actual and predicted phosphorylations/kinases. Detection of specific phosphorylations has become easier in recent years because of advancements in phosphopeptide enrichment chromatography that is compatible with mass spectrometry 64.

Since the tyrosine kinase inhibitor Gleevec (STI\u2010571, imatinib mesylate) first transformed treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia over a decade ago 94, 95, a number of tyrosine kinase inhibitors are in use as therapies for cancers 96, 97, 98, 99. In cells infected with poxviruses (vaccinia 17, 21, variola, and monkeypox 19), Gleevec inhibits the Abl family of tyrosine kinases 100 and reduces poxviral extracellular enveloped virus release. Prophylactic treatment of vaccinia\u2010infected mice reduced viral loads in ovaries at 4 days post\u2010infection and increased survival among lethally challenged mice 17. Therapeutic treatment with Gleevec at 24 and 48 h post\u2010infection likewise increased survival among vaccinia\u2010infected mice (although efficacy decreased as the time between infection and treatment increased) 19. Additionally, treatment with Gleevec reduced viral dissemination to distal tissues in mice infected intranasally with vaccinia 19. Sprycel, an inhibitor of both Src\u2010family and Abl\u2010family kinases, strongly inhibited extracellular enveloped virus formation and release in cell culture. However, unlike Gleevec, Sprycel (dasatinib) had minimal effect on mouse survival and in vivo viral load, possibly because of effects on the spleen and/or bone marrow caused by the drug's Src inhibition 19.",

IRESSA's effect on ErbB\u20101 activation and its downstream effects on ERK1/2 were correlated with a decrease in in vitro vaccinia viral infection 103 and viral spread, indicated by a dose\u2010dependent decrease in vaccinia plaque number and size 102.

For example, since Gleevec was FDA approved in 2001, some form of tyrosine kinase inhibition remains mainstay of treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia 107. The cancer indications for IRESSA have been controversial, but it was first FDA approved in 2003 for salvage use in non\u2010small cell lung cancer, and the decision to use it or other tyrosine kinase inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor as opposed to other chemotherapy with distinct modes of action has more to do with efficacy and cost than toxicity (IRESSA's generally mild toxic effects, such as acne and dermatologic conditions, respond to treatment interruptions) 108. The efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors against poxviruses in animal models is promising but has yet to be used in patients to our knowledge. Treatments, including cidofovir 109, for poxviruses are currently limited and may have toxic effects; thus, the potential development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors as safe and effective prophylactic and therapeutic treatments for poxviruses is a point of interest in current research.",

Sirolimus and everolimus are serine/threonine kinase inhibitors of the cellular mTOR kinase. KS\u2010associated herpesvirus (also known as human herpesvirus 8) can cause neoplastic hypervascular lesions in both immunocompromised and, rarely, immunocompetent patients infected by the virus. This is particularly common in patients with HIV (20 000\u00d7 the rate of the general population) or after a solid organ or bone marrow transplant patient (500\u00d7 the rate of the general population). Although no single approach to treating KS has become universally accepted, before 2004 it was common practice in transplant patients who developed KS to limit the use of immunosuppressants, leading to the resolution of some, but not all, KS\u2010related disease. A complete stop in immunosuppression, though, left patients vulnerable to graft rejection. In 2004/5, two groups 110, 111 reported a series of patient as well as accompanying animal and tissue data suggesting that switching a solid organ transplant patient's post\u2010transplant immunosuppressive cocktail from a cyclosporine\u2010based regimen to one that included sirolimus (rapamycin) resulted in a complete resolution of their biopsy\u2010proven KS lesion. Subsequent reports (reviewed by Stallone et al. 112) suggest that other mTOR inhibitors (everolimus) have the same effect and that mTOR inhibition plays an important role in the resolution of KS, although the degree to which the mechanism is less immunosuppression versus blockage of phosphorylation event(s) remains a subject of research. Mechanistic data included in these reports though do show that endothelial cells from KS tumors have upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor FLK\u20101/KDR and that mTOR inhibitors block the interaction of VEGF with FLK\u20101/KDR and limit the cellular response to VEGF.",
