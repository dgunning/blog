In the past, industry has had the dominant role in preparing products for advanced testing and licensure. The graph depicts the concept that, to develop vaccines for difficult viral pathogens and emerging virus diseases in the future, the balance of investment may need to shift more to government and public\u2013private partnerships. The y\u2010axis indicates the relative level of investment required for successive stages of vaccine development.",
