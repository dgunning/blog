The patient's antibiotic regimen was changed to piperacillin\u2010tazobactam, ceftaroline, and voriconazole to better cover chronic colonization of MRSA and previous pathogens.

In attempts to initiate more aggressive treatment, he was started empirically on moxifloxacin, amikacin, and azithromycin, based on published I. limosus and NTM antibiotic regimens. He continued to worsen with continued night sweats and a decline in ppFEV1 to 60%. Meropenem was added for additional coverage on recommendation by an Infectious Disease consultant. Given that I. limosus had grown in abundance on multiple occasions and NTM growth was rare, it became the focus of treatment and an optimal antibiotic regimen was designed based upon reported literature and identified antimicrobial susceptibilities.1, 6\n",

This patient had chronic isolation of MRSA from his upper airway and previously had mild exacerbations responding to MRSA treatment, yet did not improve with initial treatment of his usual CF pathogens. The patient repeatedly isolated large amounts of I. limosus from BAL and did not have significant improvement until aggressive treatment targeting this organism was initiated (Figure 1). While his illness began prior to isolation, it is possible I. limosus was contributing earlier given difficulty with identification and published evidence of immune response to Inquilinus prior to culture growth.4 We cannot fully rule out the influence of MRSA or MAC on this patient's course. Notably, he never isolated MRSA from his lower airway during this period and had no first\u2010line treatment directed toward MAC until after improvement from a prolonged course targeting I. limosus.",
