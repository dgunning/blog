Whiteflies are the main vector for Begomovirus, which causes serious diseases in tomato, melon, squash, etc.3, 4 High genetic diversity and morphologically indistinguishable populations are observed in B. tabaci, suggesting that it forms a species complex.",

Within this species complex, the B and Q biotypes are the most important pests worldwide. While the B biotype has high fecundity and a broad host range, the Q biotype has high\u2010temperature tolerance.6, 7 In addition, they are sometimes sympatrically distributed8, 9, 10 and have different levels of insecticide resistance, which may influence their population dynamics.7, 10, 11, 12 Therefore, the development of a rapid identification method to distinguish them is needed for pest control.",

These include random amplification polymorphism of DNA\u2010polymerase chain reaction (RAPD\u2010PCR), restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), sequence\u2010characterised amplified region (SCAR) and real\u2010time PCR technology.3, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 Nevertheless, these methods rely on specialised equipment and well\u2010trained technicians, neither of which is commonly available in the field. In addition, they are expensive and time consuming, which precludes their use in large\u2010scale surveys. More importantly, these methods might not be capable of providing real\u2010time information for pest control strategies. In the present paper, a loop\u2010mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was applied for the rapid identification of B. tabaci biotypes. The LAMP assay was developed for rapid, efficient and specific amplification of DNA, and it is performed under isothermal conditions that require a water bath or a heat block to catalyse the reaction. This method requires no specialised equipment or specially trained technicians and is more cost effective than real\u2010time PCR. Therefore, LAMP is suitable for large\u2010scale field surveys and can provide useful information for pest control strategies. LAMP is a popular and useful method for rapid pathogen/pest detection and identification. For instance, it was applied to detect the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, a serious human disease pathogen associated with pneumonia.18 In previous studies, a whitefly\u2010transmitted geminivirus was diagnosed with LAMP in infected plants.19, 20 The LAMP assay has also been applied to identify malaria mosquito vectors and the Mediterranean fruit fly, an important insect pest.21, 22\n",

It was shown that the present assay could specifically and accurately identify the B and Q biotypes. Applying LAMP assays to monitor the population dynamics of whitefly populations revealed that, while temperature may be important for population dynamics of whiteflies in the field, population dynamics in greenhouse conditions might be influenced by the types of insecticide.

The results showed that biotype B was the most common one found in the fields. Its proportion gradually increased during the sampling period in Miaoli, Taoyuan and Yilan counties (Fig. 7) and comprised more than 50% of B. tabaci individuals collected in these areas.

These assays are highly sensitive, as the detection limit can be as low as 1 pg DNA in a total of 25 \u00b5L of reaction mixture. The specificities of the LAMP assays were demonstrated using samples collected worldwide. In a comparison of the reactions between the B and Q biotypes, the LAMP reaction for the B biotype in the presence of loop primers required only 30 min, which was 15 min less than the time taken for LAMP reaction of the Q biotype with no loop primers. This result confirms that the use of loop primers efficiently reduces reaction times. Furthermore, adding SYBR Green I to the LAMP assay increased the sensitivity of detection. While there was only weak amplification detected by gel electrophoresis after 30 min of reaction, a strong positive signal was revealed by SYBR Green I staining at the same time point.",

Firstly, unlike PCR\u2010based methods, which require special equipment and reagents, the present method requires only a thermostat (such as a water or dry bath) with limited kinds of chemical. Secondly, when combined with quick DNA extraction methods, which can be done in 10 min, the total reaction takes only 1 h. Thirdly, the LAMP assay is cost effective, as one reaction costs less than $US 1 (DNA extraction, $US 0.25; primers, $US 0.07; Bst polymerase, $US 0.5; dNTP, $US 0.04; SYBR, $US 0.04). Fourthly, the result is easily visualised by a colour change, and no sophisticated analytical tool is necessary for interpretation. Finally, the procedures described here can be performed by non\u2010specialists who have limited knowledge of whiteflies or molecular biology. All of the above make it possible to conduct large\u2010scale surveys in the field. In addition, the current design provides real\u2010time monitoring for biotypes B and Q. Because these two biotypes are known to have different levels of insecticide resistance, the information could be useful in whitefly control.",

The B biotype was first introduced into Taiwan in the early 1990s,25 but its proportions among whitefly populations over time remain unclear. In the present data, the proportion of biotype B gradually increased over the course of the season in whitefly populations collected from the field in Miaoli, Taoyuan and Yilan counties. The increasing trend of B biotypes in these locations is interesting, because it seems to be consistent with the invasive theory of asymmetric mating interactions,26 in which the invasive whitefly of B. tabaci biotype B is widely displacing indigenous biotypes in the field. However, in Nantou County, the opposite trend of a decreasing B biotype population was observed, suggesting the existence of unknown factors restricting population growth in that area. Because there was only limited correlation of B biotype abundance between samples collected from greenhouses and fields, population dynamics of biotype B in the field cannot be explained by the influence of whiteflies from greenhouses. According to the life\u2010table study, environmental temperature strongly influences the development and reproduction of biotype B. The average adult longevity at 15, 20 and 28 \u00b0C was 5.5, 15.8 and 15.4 days respectively, and the fecundity levels at the above temperatures were 2, 54 and 109 eggs respectively. It seems that 20 \u00b0C is a critical temperature for the development and reproduction of biotype B. The average elevation of Nantou County is higher than those of the other three counties, and the average annual temperature in Nantou is 18.9 \u00b0C (the average monthly temperatures range from 15.4 to 22.5 \u00b0C), which is lower than the 22.7 \u00b0C in Yilan (19.8\u201326.4 \u00b0C), the 21.7 \u00b0C in Taoyuan (19.0\u201324.9 \u00b0C) and the 20.2 \u00b0C in Miaoli (17.5\u201324.2 \u00b0C). It was hypothesised that the lower average annual temperature may have limited the population growth and dispersal of biotype B in Nantou County.",

In addition, the relative proportions of B and Q biotypes varied greatly by year. The environmental conditions in greenhouses are more stable than in the field, and thus the temperature might not be the most important factor influencing population dynamics in this setting. In addition, it was shown that biotype Q has higher mortality and lower fecundity than biotype B, and the latter has a competitive advantage over the former in greenhouse conditions.6, 28 It is expected that biotype Q will be replaced by biotype B in greenhouses if there is no other intervention. Nevertheless, complex population dynamics between biotypes B and Q was observed in different years. After interviewing growers, it was found that different types of insecticide, including organophosphates, imidacloprid of the neonicotinoids, pyrethroids and pyriproxyfen, or combinations of them, were applied for whitefly control in different greenhouses. In addition, a grower would use different insecticides at different times of the year. It was proposed that different levels of insecticide resistance for B and Q biotypes might influence the dynamics and distribution of the two biotypes.10, 28 Further, neonicotinoid resistance of the Q biotype was observed in Taiwan and elsewhere.7, 10, 27 It was hypothesised that the kind of insecticide used might influence the population dynamics of the two biotypes in greenhouses in Taiwan.",

Most poinsettia greenhouse owners applied insecticides for whitefly control without prior knowledge of the biotypes. By applying the present LAMP method, greenhouse owners may be able to monitor the population dynamics of different biotypes in real time, which would be valuable for whitefly management.",

One of the most important implications of the present results is that the LAMP assays can be conducted by non\u2010specialists, using limited equipment.
