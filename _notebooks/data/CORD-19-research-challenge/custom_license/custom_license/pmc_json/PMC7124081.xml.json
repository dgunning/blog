            "text": "Twenty-five years ago in my book Risk Society (1986), I argue that there is an epochal shift from industrial to risk societies. The former were based upon industry and social class, upon welfare states and upon the distribution of various goods (as opposed to bads) organized and distributed through the state, especially of good health, extensive education, and equitable forms of social welfare. There were state-organized societies, there was a national community of fate, and there were large-scale political movements especially based upon industrial class divisions that fought over the distribution of their various goods. In the post-Second World War period in Western Europe, there was a welfare state settlement in such industrial societies based upon achieving a fairer distribution of such goods.",

            "text": "By contrast, the concept of risk society is based on the importance of bads. Risk societies involve the distribution of bads that flow within and across various territories and are not confined within the borders of a single society. Nuclear radiation is a key example of this, but also financial risks, global warming, SARS3 and so forth. These risks cannot be confined to any scientific space nor to any current sector of time. Such risks thus cannot be insured against. They are uncontrolled and the consequences are incalculable. This argument about the borderlessness of the risk society has (together with the writings of many others) developed the analysis of globalization implications for sociology. Since then, I have given particular attention to the nature and limitation of methodological nationalism. What does this mean and what is wrong with it?",

Where social actors subscribe to this belief, I talk of a national outlook; where it determines the perspective of the social scientific observer, I talk of methodological nationalism. The distinction between the perspective of the social actor and that of the social scientist is crucial, because there is only a historical connection between the two, not a logical one. This historical connection\u2014between social actors and social scientists\u2014alone gives rise to the axiomatics of methodological nationalism. Methodological nationalism is neither a superficial problem nor a minor error. It involves both the routines of data collection and production as well as the basic concepts of modern sociology and political science\u2014concepts such as society, social class, state, family, democracy, international relations etc.",

(This holds also for my book Risk Society). American sociology, in particular, developed in this way, presuming that all societies were more or less like that of the USA, just poorer! It was perfectly possible to study that particular society and then to generalize as though all, or at least most, other societies (at least those that mattered!) were much the same. This led to debates about the general nature of order or of conflict within \u2018society\u2019 based upon the distinct US pattern. Order and conflict theories were to be \u2018tested\u2019 within the USA and it was presumed that these conclusions could then be generalized to all societies or, at least, to all rich industrial societies. For decades it was simply how sociology worked; it was a taken-for-granted way of doing sociology\u2014then \u2018global studies\u2019 marched in.",

All social and moral orders hitherto had, implicitly at least, answers befitting their own age or aspiring to universal validity. Reflexive cosmopolitization casts doubt on these claims in two ways: on the one hand, the regime of the Either/Or had traditionally set territorial limits to the contradictions of particular universalist claims to a \u2018good life\u2019, a \u2018good society\u2019, and a \u2018good religion\u2019 and in so doing, defused them. In the age of cosmopolitization, this world of clear distinctions and classifications now disappears. It follows that today in the everyday encounters between world religions the claims to universal validity of the two major cultures of Europe\u2014the culture of Christianity and the culture of secular modernity\u2014no longer hold water. The same may be said of the particularist universalist claims of other religions, such as Islamist universalism (\u2018Ummah\u2019). Thus it is not just the case that religious differences become sources of conflict; over and above that, in the cosmopolitan constellation, we are witnessing the implosion of contextually defined universalisms and national and ethical certitudes along with them.

Cosmopolitan sociology neglects the Durkheim/Parsons model of \u2018value integration\u2019 of national society. It neglects also theories which declare the death of the social. But it emphasizes the transformation of the social and a new methodological cosmopolitanism to study the ambivalences of the cosmopolitization of intermediated institutions.The same applies to the international level: consider global free trade and financialization, corporate deterritorialization and transnationalized production, globalized labour use, internet communication, globally orchestrated bio-scientific manipulation of life forms and, last but not least, globally financed and managed regional wars. As stated earlier, recent world history seems to dictate that surviving these new civilizational forces, let alone benefiting from them, requires every nation to actively internalize them and one another. This is what I call \u2018(reflexive) cosmopolitization\u2019; and the civilizational condition shared across the globe I call \u2018reflexive\u2019 or \u2018second modernity\u2019.I do not see the nation-state as disappearing, but rather see it as only one of many actors in a global power game. The focus needs to be on that global power game and not on the nation-state. Importance could accrue to regional powers like \u2018Cosmopolitan Europe\u2019, (\u2018Cosmopolitan Asia\u2019 etc.).Such a shift in focus requires the restructuring of the social sciences not only conceptually, theoretically, and methodologically, but also in the very organization of research. All their fundamental concepts\u2014especially those of social class, family, work and the nation-state\u2014need to be re-examined. Many are \u2018zombie concepts\u2019 that continue to live on even though the world they related to at one time no longer exists.Cosmopolitan sociology is just at its beginnings. It entails more questions than answers [British Journal of Sociology 2006, 57(1); 2010, 61(3); Soziale Welt 2010, 61(3\u20134)]. But it does involve a fundamental re-organization of the social sciences, and a dramatic shift in focus\u2014from methodological nationalism to methodological cosmopolitanism. And it must also be critical in its orientation. One critical focus must be on the increasing inequality in the world and its social explosiveness. The focus on the nation-state has led to a shameful subordination of \u2018objective\u2019 and \u2018value-free\u2019 sociology to the imperatives of the nation-state which blinds even empirical sociology to the fundamental transnational transformations of domination and inequality.Another critical focus: problems of social inequalities and justice in first industrial nation-state modernity were once pursued and fought over as the \u2018goods\u2019 of modern society (things like incomes, jobs, social security etc.); in the cosmopolitical age, those \u2018goods\u2019 are off-set by conflicts over the \u2018bads\u2019. These include the very means by which many of the old goods were in fact attained. More pointedly, they involve the threatening and incalculable side effects and so-called \u2018externalities\u2019 produced by nuclear and chemical power, genetic research, the extraction of fossil fuels, and the overriding obsession with ensuring sustained economic growth. The social and psychic volatility wrought by cultural relativism, on the one hand, and recognition of risk, on the other, generate an enormous discontent, which in turn inspires various political and social movements for reform and resistance.\n",

The universality of such claims, moreover, is not conjured up out of thin air or by some utopian aspiration. Instead it presents itself in the form of globally available cultural models of protest and resentment, which, when enacted by activists and social movements, inspire new cycles of human agency and responsibility to change, save or otherwise repair the world in the name of \u2018a different modernity\u2019.10.Reflexive cosmopolitization includes the caveat that our orientation to the world grows ever more critically reflexive. At the same time\u2014and this is crucial\u2014it grows more universalistic, interventionist, and prescriptive: the contradictions between the hegemonic universalism of the Western world picture (\u2018the American way of life\u2019) and a new cosmopolitanism from below characterize open global conflicts about the \u2018good world\u2019 (Yates 2009)\u2014and, of course, about who has the power to define it.\n",
