After selection with puromycin for 7 days, ~1 x 108 cells were inoculated with CHIKV-181/25-mKate2 (MOI of 1) and then incubated for 24 h to allow nearly all cells to become infected. Cells were sorted for an absence of mKate2 expression using a Sony Biotechnology Synergy SY3200 Cell sorter (Siteman Flow Cytometry Core, Washington University). To enrich for the cell population that was resistant to CHIKV infection and increase the signal-to-noise ratio, the mKate2-negative cells were expanded in culture. Given the rapid replication rate and cytopathic effect of CHIKV, two humanized neutralizing mAbs5, CHK-152 and CHK-166 (2 \u03bcg/ml of each), were added to block infection by any residual virus. The expanded cells were re-infected with CHIKV-181/25-mKate2 in the absence of mAbs, sorted for mKate2 negative cells, and the procedure was repeated for one additional round.",

One representative experiment of two is shown. d. Sanger sequencing of Mxra8 in control and \u0394Mxra8 3T3 or MEF cells. Sequencing data shows an alignment and individual out-of-frame deletions. e. Viability of control and \u0394Mxra8 3T3 and MEF cells. An equal number of cells were plated and viability was assessed over a 24 h period using the Cell-Titer Glo assay. The results were normalized to control cells and pooled from two experiments (n = 6). Error bars indicate SD.",

Surface expression of Mxra8 on CHO-K1 (WT) and CHO-745 (glycosaminoglycan deficient15) cells stably transduced with control (vector-only) or mouse Mxra8 as judged by flow cytometry. b. Confirmation of HS expression on the surface of CHO-K1 (WT) and CHO-745 cells. Surface expression of HS was evaluated using the R17 protein of rodent herpesvirus Peru, which binds to glycosaminoglycans on the surface of cells38. R17GAG2 is a mutant form of the protein that lacks binding to glycosaminoglycans and served as a negative control. For a and b, data are representative of two experiments. c. CHO-K1 (WT) and CHO-745 cells were transduced stably with control (vector) or mouse Mxra8 and inoculated with CHIKV (strains 181/25, AF15561, or LR-2006) and processed for intracellular E2 protein staining by flow cytometry.
