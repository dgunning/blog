Classical swine fever virus (CSFV), which belongs to the genus Pestivirus of the Flaviviridae family, is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus encoding four structural proteins (C, Erns, E1 and E2) and eight non-structural proteins (Npro, P7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B) (Lamp et al.\n2011). These non-structural proteins participate in self-maturation and replication complex assembly (Sheng et al.\n2012).",

Specifically, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus as well as their resident proteins are used by many viruses to complete one or more stages in their life cycle (Ravindran et al.\n2016; Wang et al.\n2016). Anterograde and retrograde trafficking of cargo proteins between the ER and Golgi are mediated by the cytosolic coat protein complex II (COP II) and COP I transport systems, respectively. These systems are regulated by viruses to facilitate their multiplication (Rust et al.\n2001; Richards et al.\n2002; Yamayoshi et al.\n2008). Viruses also regulate two important targets, i.e. Golgi-specific BFA-resistance guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (GBF1) and Rab2 GTPases, which are primarily involved in Golgi-to-ER retrograde trafficking (Raj 1961; Wessels et al.\n2006).",

The RNA concentration was determined using a Nucleic Acid and Protein Analyzer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA) at a wavelength of 260 nm. The PrimeScriptTM RT Reagent Kit (TaKaRa) was used for reverse transcription and cDNA synthesis. For real-time PCR, specific oligonucleotide primers (table 2) were used to determine the expression levels of different genes. The reaction was performed with SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (TaKaRa) using the Bio-Rad iQ5 system under the following conditions: pre-degeneration at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of degeneration at 95\u00b0C for 10 s, and annealing and extension at 60\u00b0C for 30 s. RNA expression in the samples was normalized to that of \u03b2-actin. The 2\u2212\u0394\u0394CT method was used to analyse the data. The \u0394CT values were calculated as the CT values of the target gene minus the CT values of \u03b2-actin. GBF1 and Rab2 gene expression levels in ST cells or CSFV RNA in ST cells at the earliest time point were selected as comparative references, and so the average \u0394CT values were set as the standard reference for the \u2212\u0394\u0394CT calculation. Then the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394CT values were obtained and histograms were obtained in which the height of the bar for each sample represented the average 2\u2212\u0394\u0394CT value.\n",

CSFV NS2 and NS5A are located in the ER (Tang et al.\n2010; He et al.\n2012). NS5B, which is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of CSFV, is located in the cytoplasm (Zhao et al.\n2006).

The proliferation of viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Goueslain et al.\n2010) and dengue virus (Carpp et al.\n2014), is sensitive to BFA treatment owing to the inhibitory effect of BFA on GBF1 and the consequent inhibition of COP I vesicle formation. However, three BFA-sensitive large Arf-GEFs (GBF1, BIG1 and BIG2) are present in mammalian cells (Li et al.\n2014). Therefore, GCA and RNA interference were used for further tests. GCA is a highly specific inhibitor of GBF1 and had the same inhibitory effect on CSFV proliferation as BFA. Furthermore, CSFV replication in GBF1 shRNA-transfected cells was significantly inhibited compared with that in GBF1-undisturbed cells. Conversely, CSFV multiplication was increased in cells overexpressing GBF1. Therefore, GBF1 participated in CSFV multiplication.",

GBF1 is involved in the multiplication of many viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (de Wilde et al.\n2015), dengue virus (Carpp et al.\n2014) and influenza virus (Watanabe et al.\n2014). One of the mechanisms by which GBF1 regulates viral multiplication involves the GBF1-ARF1-COP I pathway. HCV replication is suppressed when the functions of GBF1 and ARF1 are disturbed (Goueslain et al.\n2010; Matto et al.\n2011). Dengue virus uses the GBF1-ARF1/ARF4-COP I pathway to form capsids around lipid droplets (Iglesias et al.\n2015). GBF1-mediated ARF1 activation is crucial for mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) RNA replication (Verheije et al.\n2008), Ebola virus virion formation (Yamayoshi et al.\n2010), and diverse families of negative-stranded RNA viruses (Panda et al.\n2011). Other metabolic pathways are also regulated by GBF1 and are involved in virus proliferation. GBF1 simultaneously regulates ARF4 and ARF5 to modulate HCV replication (Farhat et al.\n2016). GBF1 has other functions in HCV replication in BFA-resistant hepatoma-derived cells (Farhat et al.\n2012). Here, we discovered that both CSFV RNA replication and virus particle formation were inhibited by the disturbance of GBF1 function. However, the CSFV proliferation dynamics in ARF1 shRNA-transfected cells were not different from those in control cells (data not shown). Therefore, GBF1 may regulate some metabolic pathways without ARF1 to modulate CSFV proliferation. The detailed function of GBF1 in CSFV proliferation requires further investigation.",

Moreover, Rab2 is essential for Golgi organization (Haas et al.\n2007) and can regulate COP I-mediated retrograde transport to intervene with the release of HCV particles (Raj 1961). In the present study, CSFV replication was suppressed when Rab2 was down-regulated. The overexpression of Rab2 can accelerate CSFV proliferation. The mechanisms by which Rab2 influences CSFV proliferation must be further investigated.",

            "text": "As the cargo sorting station within the cell, the Golgi apparatus participates in protein and vesicular transport (Mironov et al.\n2013; Guo et al.\n2014). Additionally, the secretory pathways involved in the Golgi apparatus are always utilized by viruses for egress on infected cells. Transport from early endosomes to the trans-Golgi network is important for vaccinia virus membrane wrapping and egress (Sivan et al. 2016). Human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) can egress via the exosomal release pathway by budding at trans-Golgi network vacuoles and inducing multivesicular body formation (Mori et al. 2008). Furthermore, the hepatitis E virus and HCV also utilize the exosome release pathway for egress (Tamai et al. 2011; Nagashima et al. 2014). However, viral egress is a complicated process that involves many pathways and related proteins. Reports have shown that HCV can be released from Huh7 cells via a trans-Golgi network-to-endosome pathway (Jamel et al. 2016). Additionally, HCV particles are found in endosomal compartments and released via a non-canonical secretory route that is unrelated to the Golgi-associated secretory route and may be an undescribed cellular secretion route (Bayer et al. 2016). Viral egress has a close connection with the virus particle formation process. CSFV is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus that has no cytopathic effect in infected cells. The CSFV assembly process is still unclear and mysterious because its core protein is dispensable for CSFV assembly (Riedel et al.\n2012). Additional experiments are urgently needed to determine the mechanisms of CSFV assembly and egress.",
