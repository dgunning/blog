            "text": "Effective initiation of specific anti-tumor immunity in vivo or in vitro has been investigated by many scientists1-3. Most of their research has focused on the induction of adequate tumor antigen-specific effector cells. For this purpose, tumor antigens or tumor-associated antigens were prepared in vitro by expressing them to produce recombinant peptides, cloning them to construct recombinant DNA vaccines, or loading them to dendritic cells (DCs) to making DC vaccines4-11. All efforts were devoted to efficiently conjugate tumor antigens to T cells so that immune tolerance could be broken. Many studies revealed promising results for inhibiting tumor growth inhibition and elongation of animal survival in animal tumor models. However, tumor is a multiple genetic disease and targeting one or two signaling molecules in tumor cells may be not enough to inhibit growth12,13. The use of tumor lysate as tumor antigens was developed and utilized for many tumor cell lines in modified ways and proved to be an effective strategy to inhibit growth14-16. Most studies showed undesired results in inducing specific anti-tumor immunity, while others manifested potential anti-tumor effects17-21. The advantage of using tumor lysate as antigens is that it provides a feasible avenue to target multiple sites on tumor cells. Various attempts had been made to enhance the antigenicity of tumor lysate, such as plusing DC to tumor lysate or combining cytokines (e.g. GM-CSF) with tumor lysate. These methods have demonstrated efficacy in some tumor types but not for all. Despite this, the use of tumor lysates as a potential anti-tumor vaccine has proved to be a valuable tool.",

In recent decades, agonists of toll like receptor 9 (TLR9), such as CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODN), have displayed potential as an adjuvant for various vaccines due to their strong immune stimulating activity22-27. Based on their biological activities, CpG ODNs are divided into A, B and C classes. A-class CpG ODN mainly induced plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) to secret large amounts of interferon-\u03b1 thereby indirectly activating NK cells. B-class CpG ODN strongly stimulated strong B cells, NK cells activation, or cytokine secretion28. C-class CpG ODN share both of the properties of A-class and B-class CpG ODN29,30. To test whether CpG ODN could enhance the anti-tumor effect of tumor cell lysate-based tumor vaccines, CpG685, a C-class CpG ODN, was used as an adjuvant to induce anti-tumor immune response against B16 melanoma in mice.",

Finally, the target cells were washed twice with PBS, resuspended in medium, and dispensed in duplicate at 5\u00d7103 cells/well into 96-well U-bottom plates. Effector cells were incubated with labeled target cells at various E:T (effector cells : target cells) ratios at 37\u00b0C , 5% CO2 for 5 h. After centrifugation, the cell pellet was resuspended in FACS staining buffer and immediately analyzed by FACS Calibur. PKH-26 positive cells were gated and same cell numbers were acquired for each sample. The percentage of specific cell lysis in the target cell population was determined by the disappearance of the antigen labeled targets from the CFSEHi population compared to the fluorescence of the control targets in the CFSEHi population. To calculate the specific lysis, the following equation was used: specific lysis (%) = [1-(mean CFSEHi of experiment group/mean CFSEHi of spontaneous release)]\u00d7100.",

The results signified that the tumor had spread throughout the abdominal cavity including the greater omentum, mesentery and diaphragm in mice injected with PBS but not in mice treated with tumor lysate + CpG ODN-685 (Fig. 1C). Histopathologically, a large number of melanoma cells were detected in the omentum of mice administrated with PBS.

The CpG ODN-685 sequence differs from the A-class sequence 2216 (5'GGGGGACGATCGTCGGGGGg3') in its primary structure. However, the CpG ODN-685 sequence is similar with C & B-class CpG ODN. Our previous work showed that C-class CpG ODN could induce the production of mixed IFNs including IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3 and at least 11 subtypes of IFN-\u03b137. The importance of NK cell mediated anti-tumor immunity was supported by the evidence that NK cells activated by A-class CpG ODN could induce tumor rejection in a variety of mouse tumors, especially weakly immunogenic tumors such as melanoma and fibrosarcoma38-40. CpG ODN-685 can promote human PBMC cells to enhance CD80 and CpG ODN-685 thereby enhancing HLA A2. It is important for the antigen to be presented efficiently to Th cells. It has been demonstrated that both IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 directly induce cytostatic effects on tumor cells. Indirectly, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 activates innate immune cells including NK cells and macrophages to kill tumor cells. Good antigen delivery systems could target antigen presented cells and prolong antigen presentation by preventing degradation. Regarding the mechanisms of adjuvant action, CpG ODN-685 possesses high efficiency to induce an early and strong cytokine and chemokine-rich environment at the site of injection. CpG ODN-685 can also activate NK cell in the experiment of CD69 expression in PBMCs. These results suggest that CpG ODN-685 is a valid inducer of natural immune response as well as adaptive immune response and that CpG ODN-685 can be used for anti-tumor research. Noticeably, CpG ODN-685 can inhibit tumor growth upon subcutaneously injection into the tumor draining lymph node (TDLN) area in mice.",

This may be attributed to the ability of tumor cells to provide sufficient tumor antigen upon CpG ODN usage. Based on our results, in vivo subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injection of CpG ODN-685 or tumor cell lysate could not trigger an effective anti-tumor immune response. However the combination of tumor cell lysate with CpG ODN-685 can lead to an effective immune response. This suggests that both CpG ODN-685 and tumor cell lysate play a role in this immune response.",

            "text": "Analysis of lymphocyte transformation in different tumor inoculation locations, suggests that CD4+/CD8+ T-cells significantly increase within 24~48 h after tumor inoculation. However, there was little change in NK cells or Treg cells. Upon tumor inoculation, it indicated that CD4+/CD8+ may be involved in this immune response. Results from the CTL assay showed that CD8+ T cells have immune activity. Using CpG ODN-685 alone did not cause an effective CTL response, but CpG ODN-685 combined with tumor cell lysate generated specific CTLs. However, further studies of CpG ODN-685 as an adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy are limited. Our results showed that CpG ODN-685 combined with tumor cell lysate could generate strong T cell responses against B16 tumor cell. Considering tumor cell lysate alone can't effectively cause anti-tumor immune response in mice, we hypothesize that besides CD8+ T cell, lymphocytes are also involved in anti-tumor response. DTH data on mouse survival showed that the degree of foot pad swelling in mice within the combination group was much higher than that of control group. This indicates that CD4+ T cells are involved in the immune response. CTL and DTH data suggested that CD8+ T cell and CD4+ T cell are involved in the immune response which cause by the combination of tumor cell lysate with CpG ODN-685. From these results, we concluded that the combination of tumor cell lysate and CpG685 can induce differentiation of CD8+ T cells, and this effect was under the assistance of CD4+ T cells. These results, however, were different from other results. For example, the combination of CpG1826 and peptide vaccine caused by CD8+ T cell response is not dependent on the assistance of CD4+ T cells. In addition, specific CTLs caused by soluble protein vaccines plus CpG ODN did not require the helper T cell pathway41,42. So we believe that CpG ODN induction of different immune responses may be associated with different types of tumor antigens.",

We presumed that lymphocytes increase could produce an effective immune response, so tumors must be inhibited effectively in these two groups, but the results suggested otherwise. Therefore, we hypothesized that the number of lymphocytes increased when an organism received the external stimuli. Whether these increased lymphocytes could induce the anti-tumor effects or not may depend on the level of lymphocyte affinity. High-affinity CD8+ T cells were more effective in B16 tumor cell inhibition than that of low-affinity CD8+ T cell. Otherwise, invalid T-cell activation could lead to a reduction in T cell proliferation. In addition these proliferating cells played a weak role in killing tumor cells and led to tumor tolerance. Therefore, we presumed that CpG ODN-685 combined with tumor cell lysate can be more effective in T cell activation, and these T cells may have higher affinity.",
