RTIs can be further classified as upper tract respiratory infections (UTRI) and lower tract respiratory infections (LTRI). The infections of the upper tract are most common and include rhinitis, croup, sinusitis, pharyngitis, epiglottitis, and laryngitis. The infections of the lower tract are more fatal and include pneumonia, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and influenza.1 Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are tremendous cause of health problems and mortality in emerging countries.2 In South Asia, 48 of every 1000 children died before the age of five.3 Pakistan is currently ranked as the sixth most populous country with the population of 199 million.4 It is estimated that about 20% to 30% of all deaths of children under 5 years of age are because of respiratory infections in Pakistan.5 This paper comprises an introduction to viral respiratory infections, common genotypes of viruses associated with respiratory infections in different regions of Pakistan, and data from surveys led from 2007 onwards.",

The 75 identified strains were typed as 71 strains of RSV\u2010A and four strains of RSV\u2010B.8 Another study employed 1941 samples, analyzed by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) for RSV infection. Twenty four percent of samples were positive, and out of these positive, 22% were subtyped RSV\u2010B. Three genotypes of RSV\u2010B\u2014BA\u20109, BA\u201010, and BA\u201013\u2014were isolated.9 Throat swabs were tested by RT\u2010PCR. Nineteen percent of cases were identified as RSV associated infections. RSV appeared to be more incident from August to October and highest in September. Susceptibility increased in rainy seasons.10 HMPV was detected in 7% of the cases in the above scenario, most of which were children under 1 year of age.11\n",

Eighty samples showed positivity for RSV with a clear peak activity in winter season.17 Another study conducted in Karachi from August 2009 to September 2011 reported 13 out of the 27 cases diagnosed with pneumonia which were positive for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.18 One more study was conducted during November 2010 and September 2011 in Karachi, Pakistan. All of the children were admitted because of severe pneumonia, out of which 18% were diagnosed with viral pneumonia. Throat swabs were analyzed using RT\u2010PCR. Out of 169 children, 24 were detected with human metapneumovirus (HMPV), 9 with influenza A and 30 with RSV. Nine out of 169 admitted patients (aged 6 weeks to 2 years) with pneumonia were diagnosed positive for influenza A virus, out of which eight tested positive for H1N1 strain.19 According to a descriptive study from Lady Reading Hospital Peshawar, conducted during October 2015 and February 2016, out of 145 suspected cases, 37 were selected on the basis of various factors including age, gender, residence, hypoxia, pregnancy status, symptoms, positivity to PCR, fatality, ventilation support, and radiological findings. All of the cases were tested positive for H1N1 strain of influenza A.20 In 2016, one more study was conducted in the rural district of Matiari in Sindh, Pakistan. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from identified cases of pneumonia. The analysis was done by using multiplex RT\u2010PCR. A total of 817 newborns were enrolled and 49 enrolled for 2 years; 77.8% (179/230) were positive for any of the following: RSV, influenza virus, HMPV, enterovirus/rhinovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and human Bocavirus. The incidence of 11.9 per 100 children was observed for laboratory\u2010confirmed viral pneumonia; 51.7% of patients were detected with Enterovirus/rhinovirus, 8.3% with parainfluenza virus type 3, and 5.7% with RSV.7 Bashir and colleagues conducted a detailed study during March 2011 to April 2012 in two hospitals of Islamabad, Pakistan; 75% of cases among children aged less than 2 years were viral. Samples were analyzed using RT\u2010PCR. Major pathogens included 44% RSV\u2010A, 23% RSV\u2010B, 24.5% influenza A, 7% influenza B, 8.4% adenovirus, and 5.2% HMPV. RSV\u2010A and RSV\u2010B association was detected more commonly during 2 to 6 months of age, while influenza A was estimated as more common in 2.1 to 6\u2010month age group.9 RSV association with kids between the ages of one and 5 years old suffering from pneumonia and asthma was the most widely recognized finding of a 3\u2010year study conducted in Karachi from August 2009 to June 2012. In older children between the ages of one and 5 years old, pneumonia and asthma were the most widely recognized findings.10 In another study conducted by the group, the cases were characterized by pneumonia followed by bronchiolitis.11\n",

Results pointed out the significant increase of about 50% in activity of RSV in winter.17 Another study conducted in Agha Khan University Hospital, Karachi identified 27 positive cases for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. This study was conducted from August 2009 to September 2011. Total of 812 children were enrolled, out of which 3.3% resulted positive with viral etiology. Four of the admissions diagnosed were of bronchiolitis. The samples were tested using RT\u2010PCR. The results of this study estimated 15% fatality rate.18 Association of key viral pathogen RSV and influenza virus was identified in children under 2 years of age hospitalized with bronchiolitis during March 2011 and April 2012 in Islamabad, Pakistan. Major pathogens involved were RSV\u2010A, RSV\u2010B, influenza A, influenza B, adenovirus, and HMPV. Cases involving dual and even multiple pathogens were also identified.9 Children less than 5 years of age conceded with intense respiratory contaminations (ARI) were enlisted for another study conducted at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi. This study spanned the duration of 3 years from August 2009 to June 2012. RT\u2010PCR was done for RSV testing by using throat swabs.

Particularly in the countryside communities of Pakistan, the occurrence of respiratory viruses is more periodic and common especially in children under 2 years of age. Evaluation of reported data has identified several pathogens involved in causing respiratory infections. Pathogens involved include RSV, HMPV, enterovirus/rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and human Bocavirus. Especially, RSV is a major respiratory pathogen as reported by cited articles with both RSV\u2010A and RSV\u2010B, circulating in Pakistan. It is responsible for causing the death of children and infants. Three genotypes of RSV\u2010B, BA\u20109, BA\u201010, and BA\u201013, are observed. Influenza A (H1N1, H5N1, H3N2, and H1N1pdm09) and influenza B are common among Pakistani natives. Despite the fact that influenza strains keep circulating during the whole year but usually causes seasonal pandemics with high occurrence during winter and spring period. A number of diseases are associated with respiratory tract. However, available data include pneumonia, bronchiolitis, and influenza. Pneumonia is common among children whereas every year 2 to 3 episodes of influenza are commonly observed. Bronchiolitis is not common. On the other hand, such high mortality rate is also because of the inadequate awareness and lack of disease control strategies.",
