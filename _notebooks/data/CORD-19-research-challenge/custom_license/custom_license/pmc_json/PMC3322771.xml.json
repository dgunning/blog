From March to May 2003, we identified 128 patients who fulfilled our definition of a true SARS case. Sixteen of them died before a convalescent-phase blood sample could be collected; 9 received convalescent-phase plasma therapy. These 25 cases were excluded. As a result, 103 true SARS cases were analyzed. Three were pediatric patients of ages 5, 11, and 16 years. Eighty-six were adults from 21 to 64 years of age (mean 35.7, SD 11.3), 60.5% were female. The remaining 14 were elderly patients 66 to 89 years (mean 75.6, SD 7.8), 50.0% female. Pneumonia developed in all these patients; five required intensive care and eventually recovered; four died of the infection.",

On the other hand, if the screening result was negative or showed nonspecific fluorescent signals, a follow-up sample was collected for repeat testing. In addition, when a titer of 1:40 was obtained on the second sample, a third sample was collected for repeat testing.

            "text": "Serologic diagnosis remains an indispensable means for confirming viral infection status. Antibody assays based on virus-infected cells or whole viral lysate might produce cross-reactivity between infections because of closely related viruses. As common cold\u2013associated coronavirus infections are highly prevalent, the specificity of whole virus-based assays for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection is a concern. Our results indicated that an infected cell-based indirect immunofluorescence test for anti-SARS IgG antibody provided a sensitivity and specificity of 100%. However, this immunofluorescence test is relatively labor intensive. Experienced technicians are required to examine the results, in particular to differentiate nonspecific signals from positive results. These properties make the test not ideal for large-scale studies. Nevertheless, its high sensitivity and specificity make the test applicable to ascertain infection status and to serve as a reference for assessing the performance of high-throughput second-generation assays such as enzyme immunoassay. The immunofluorescence test can also be used as a confirmatory assay for samples reactive to screening assays. Further development of more feasible assays with high throughput and performance should be pursued. Evaluation of the role of other classes of anti\u2013SARS-CoV antibodies in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection is needed.",
