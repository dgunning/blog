The screening of tissues collected from living donors for TIAs is effectively no different to the screening of blood donations, in that the blood samples used for screening are collected by normal venepuncture from living individuals. The characteristics of the samples are identical and the screening is performed using assays specifically designed, developed and supplied to test blood samples collected from living individuals. It is the screening of tissues from deceased donors, where the blood samples are collected post-mortem (non heart beating), that presents some specific problems that need to be overcome to ensure accurate and reliable screening results. These problems all surround the overall quality of the samples obtained and their validity as suitable substrates for the assays used; the time post-mortem of collection, the integrity of the sample, volume, level of haemolysis, biochemical changes post-mortem etc. However, as long as these problems are acknowledged and dealt with, and resolved in the right ways, the overall quality of the screening programme should be the same whether the samples collected to screen the tissue donations are from living or deceased donors.",

These 5 infectious agents are those for which there is published, irrefutable evidence of transmission through blood and other body fluids, and therefore the potential for transmission through residual blood in tissue products. The agents are generally present in populations worldwide, although the prevalence and incidence does vary significantly from country to country, and present such a general risk that, in theory, any donor could be infected, irrespective of absence of (known) risk or symptoms. It is important to understand that risk is something that the pre-donation questioning and selection process seeks to identify, but donors may have been exposed to an infectious agent through a route that they were not aware of. In addition, all of these infectious agents do produce asymptomatic sub-clinical and chronic infections, and donors may appear to be fit and well at the time of donation whilst being infected and thus infectious. This is especially important in the screening of cadaveric donors as they obviously cannot be questioned directly, and the selection process is dependent upon what family and close contacts believe, which may not necessarily be the truth.",

Specific examples of infectious agents that can be defined as discretionary are West Nile Virus (WNV), Plasmodium spp. (causative agents of malaria), Trypanosoma cruzi (causative agent of Chagas\u2019 disease). To be considered as a potential risk there is an absolute requirement for exposure of the donor to the virus (WNV) or parasite (Plasmodium/ Trypanosoma) by either living in, or visiting, an endemic area.

The fundamental differences in the origins of the tissues, and thus the approaches available to \u201cscreen\u201d the donors, means that the two have to be considered separately, and separate strategies developed. Whilst the core screening needs are essentially the same, the obvious restrictions in the donor selection process that can be applied to deceased donors means that there is a much greater reliance on in-vitro laboratory testing to determine the safety of the tissues collected. In the case of surgical tissues, however, the donor can be treated in virtually the same way as any blood donor, with a formal donor selection process prior to donation to identify any specific risks and determine the overall suitability of the donor as a source of a tissue donation. Although laboratory testing is still the final decider in the release of the donation for clinical use, experience from the selection of blood donors has shown the value of the donor selection process in reducing the risk of collecting a donation from a \u201chigh risk\u201d donor, namely a donor who may have been recently infected, and is infectious, but where the infection may not be detectable at that time with the tests in use \u2013 the window period.",

Again, this area is very similar to that for blood screening. The algorithms that are used for blood screening apply equally to tissue, and any other donation, screening. However it is essential to define the most appropriate algorithm for the particular screening performed, and it is here that blood and tissue screening may diverge. There are really only three possible algorithms that can be used for the screening of donations from low-risk donor populations to determine their fate, i.e. suitable for use or discard:Algorithm 1   Initial screening test (Assay A) and use the results obtained to determine the donation fate.

Although every donation is valuable, it is appropriate to point out that blood donations are more numerous than tissue donations, donors can donate regularly and it is far easier to replenish stocks. Thus the specificity of the screening and the algorithms, whilst important, is not so critical for blood donations, and the algorithm used reflects this. Indeed in those countries that use Algorithm 1, the unnecessary wastage of blood donations is even higher. However, in the case of tissue donations, and especially deceased donations where a single cadaver could provide a significant number of different tissues, the specificity of the screening algorithm is of far greater significance as repeatable screen reactivity would result in the discard of the products, even if that reactivity could be subsequently proven, through confirmatory testing, to be non-specific. Algorithm 3 is based upon the use of a second assay, Assay B that has at least equal sensitivity to Assay A, that is used to test the initial screen reactives. The algorithm is based on the fact that most non-specific reactivity is assay specific, and thus the majority of non-specific reactivity seen with Assay A, are unlikely to be seen with Assay B, whilst any true reactivity will always be seen in both assays. The algorithm increases the specificity of screening significantly, reducing the unnecessary loss of donations just to those that are reactive with both assays, generally those where infection is more likely to be confirmed. However Algorithm 3 is more challenging, both technically and from a quality management perspective, and is not an algorithm that is felt to be advantageous in a mass screening environment, screening blood donations. The major issue here is that a lot of tissue donations are collected, tested and processed by transfusion services and the screening approach used is that which was developed for blood donations, and may not be the optimal for other donation types, especially deceased donations. Thus consideration must be given to implementing the most appropriate algorithm for the product type, rather than the blanket use of algorithms that are primarily designed for blood donations, and where a lower level of specificity may be more acceptable.",

            "text": "It is the nature of the blood sample collected from a cadaver that presents the major challenges. Blood samples collected post-mortem may be different from those collected ante-mortem for a number of reasons. The sample is collected from a now static fluid that is settling into its cellular and liquid phases, in which coagulation may have occurred with the resultant biochemical changes including red cell damage, and where cell death is taking place with the release of a wide range of cell chemicals into the surrounding tissue fluids. The overall results of this may be gross haemolysis and/or other changes to the \u201cblood\u201d collected, including degradation of the screening targets that would be present in blood of an infected individual, and/or the release of substances that may be inhibitory to the screening assays used. However the changes that occur post-mortem obviously vary between cadavers, depending upon factors such as: age, cause of death, time between death and the cold-storage of the cadaver, time pre-mortem under direct clinical care and the interventions used, other underlying conditions (that do not de-bar tissue donation), and time post-mortem of sample collection. Thus the occurrence of post-mortem changes per se do not necessarily make any sample collected a less suitable substrate for screening. The screening of post-mortem samples from deceased tissue donors has been performed for many years in many countries with few, if any, known adverse outcomes. In addition assays can be validated for use with deceased samples, and indeed a few commercially available infectious disease screening assays for blood-borne viruses have undergone some limited validation work by the manufacturer with the resultant inclusion of claims that the assays can be used to screen deceased samples collected under certain conditions.",

Clearly the sooner after death the sample is taken, the less likely it is to have been effected by any post-mortem changes. Interestingly however, currently there are few published papers that look critically at the time post-mortem for sample collection. Regulatory requirements within the EU require sample collection within 24 hours post-mortem, and in the US there is an expectation that tissues would be collected as soon as possible post-mortem, and within 24 hours, but this is currently not subject to any specific regulation. There are published studies on aspects of deceased testing that include samples collected up to 48 hours post-mortem and without any problems being encountered [4, 8], but specific studies on sample suitability related to time of collection are lacking.",

            "text": "Additionally there is the problem of possible haemodilution [9]. Very often the deceased donors were on life-support systems prior to their death and this may have involved either volume replacement with a range of inert volume expanders or by transfusion, in both cases potentially diluting out the constituents of the patients\u2019 own blood and therefore reducing the representativeness of the sample in terms of reflecting the true status of the donor. The immediate pre-mortem history of the donor must be known if there is any likelihood of adverse effects due to haemodilution, and at the very least the sample collection site chosen to try to minimise the risk of collection of a sample containing a significant amount of resuscitation fluid. There is a reported case of the failure of screening to identify an HIV infected tissue donor specifically because of massive fluid infusion shortly before death with the resultant dilution of HIV antibodies to below that detectable. Interestingly the antibody level returned to that normally seen, and detectable, 48 hours later as the tissue fluids naturally re-distributed themselves [10]. However, most of the studies performed [9] have indicated that the modern screening assays used will tolerate a significant dilution of plasma before approaching the point at which a false negative result may occur. This situation is most likely to occur following significant acute blood loss and this fact will be apparent when assessing any potential deceased donor. There are FDA guidelines which seek to help clarify the situation, and these require tissue banks to develop algorithms to determine the degree of haemodilution and the action to be taken in terms of the validity of screening results [11] Within NHSBT there is a clear algorithm that can be followed in cases where haemodilution has occurred, that enables the degree of haemodilution, and thus sample suitability, to be assessed.",

These include the presence of a suitable volume of fluid in the vessel and the accessibility of the vessel to facilitate sample collection, the probability of any resulting damage to tissues of interest, for example samples collected through cardiac stab, and the collection process itself must ensure that a suitable sample is obtained, i.e. sufficient serum/plasma to be able to perform all of the screening tests required. In addition the possibility of bacterial contamination of both the sample and the tissue itself, either due to bacteria already present in the cadaver or through the collection process itself, must always be considered.

A common and important feature of most of the relevant blood-borne infectious agents is that they are all persistent infections which generally do not resolve naturally.

The solid phase carries the immobilised components of the assay, those designed to capture the specific target that may or may not be present in the liquid phase (sample). In the microwell format assays, the well is coated with either antigen (Ag) or antibody (Ab), depending on the specific target (Ag to detect Ab, Ab to detect Ag). Captured target is then detected using a conjugate which detects any Ag/Ab complex formed and has an enzyme attached to it.

This ensures highly accurate and reproducible results and thus the overall reliability of the screening process. However, at the same time this aspect is also a problem, certainly in the case of deceased samples, as the automated screening platforms are designed specifically for the screening of blood donations. This is primarily to do with the automated sample detection systems rather than the assays themselves, with for example, haemolysed, low volume, or slightly diluted samples all being rejected as unsuitable for processing. As identified previously, it is here that surgical tissue donations align virtually completely with blood donations as the samples for both are collected from living individuals and are thus generally good quality samples, the optimum for these systems. Whereas deceased samples are commonly rejected by such systems as they fail to be detected properly by the system and therefore not sampled and not tested.

A past major reported issue has been the specificity of the serological screening of deceased donations. Many authors report high reactive rates with the serological screening assays in use and the consequent high losses of donations. Whilst it is true that some deceased samples do present challenges when performing serological screening, mainly those that are visibly of poor quality, our experience is that the specificity of the screening assay is not the problem that some report, rather our concern is over the overall sensitivity of the screening programme. It is important that the assays used are validated specifically for use with deceased samples to determine both any specificity issues and any sensitivity issues. The problem is that specificity issues can be seen as high screen reactive rates which are not subsequently confirmed, wasteful but not affecting safety. However any sensitivity issues would only be seen once an infected donation had been transplanted and the recipient infected. Thus an important part of assay evaluation and validation for the screening of deceased blood samples is to demonstrate that the deceased nature of the sample does not reduce the sensitivity of the assay. Unfortunately this in itself presents problems as suitable cadaveric samples are simply not available and indirect methods have to be used [13].",

At this time the infectious agents that are targets for molecular screening are hepatitis B virus (HBV DNA), hepatitis C virus (HCV RNA) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV RNA), and, for one particular product human cytomegalovirus (HCMV DNA), Table 10.2 outlines the viral nucleic acids for which tissue donations collected within the UK transfusion services are screened. Essentially the molecular screening used to detect low levels of virus can be broken down into two elements, the extraction and purification of any nucleic acid in the sample and then the subsequent specific amplification and detection of any target nucleic acid present. Although viral nucleic acid may be present in the sample from the donor, and even if there are thousands of genome copies present, the overall amount of \u201cnative\u201d nucleic acid present is still far too small to be able to detect directly with the technology currently available. Instead, the approach taken is to isolate the nucleic acid present in the sample and then amplify any specific target that may be present to a level that can then be detected either by direct visualisation using nucleic acid binding fluorescent dyes or through enzyme action with the generation of a chemiluminescent signal, both in proportion to the amount of nucleic acid present. There are currently 2 main molecular methodologies used in the molecular screening of donations for infectious agents, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and transcription mediated amplification (TMA).

However, although not to the same degree, sample quality is still a factor to be considered. Although designed to work with a range of different sample types, the initial sample handling side of the automated systems may, in the same way as with serological systems, reject unsuitable samples, those that are not detected or are rejected by the sample detection systems. However, molecular techniques do have a distinct advantage over serology in that each sample has an internal control added prior to the nucleic acid extraction process that is extracted and amplified concurrently with any specific target that may be present, and which is then detected using a separate detection system. Thus every sample should score as positive with the internal control, irrespective of the presence of the specific target of interest, uniquely, validating each negative result. Failure of the internal control indicates a failure of the process at some point, whether it be due to a failure of the molecular reagents themselves or due to inhibition of the reagents by something within the sample itself, and invalidates the results for the sample.",

Later in infection the serological markers present are far easier to demonstrate and the assays significantly less expensive than molecular assays. The important question is then to determine the increased value provided by including molecular screening in addition to serological screening. Although molecular screening does theoretically offer earlier detection of infection, its actual value is very much related to the biology of the individual infectious agents, the overall performance of the serological screening and the incidence of infection in the population. Where antigen assays are available, there is generally only limited additional value to be had from molecular screening, unless the incidence of infection is high enough to indicate that significant number of donors may have been exposed to the agent. However, in low-risk populations this is rarely the case. However, where only antibody assays are available and where the window period of infection is relatively long, molecular screening may have more value. However, again it is the incidence of the infection in the donor population that determines how many donors would be likely to be detected by molecular and not by serological screening. In low risk populations the actual numbers of donors who would be detectable by molecular screening and not by serological screening is extremely low. Currently, for HCV in blood donations collected within the NBS, the number of HCV RNA positive but serology negative donations is approximately 1 in 55.4 million donations, i.e. one donation per 28 years at the current donation level.",

The same applies when comparing antigen (with or without antibody) screening with molecular screening.

The higher the incidence of infection, the greater the risk that a donor could have been recently infected. At the same time the ability to detect an infected donation is dependent upon having an effective and appropriate screening programme in place. A screening programme with a relatively poor sensitivity is more likely to fail to detect recently infected donors. However the overall risk is also dependent upon the actual number of donations collected, and although the incidence of infection may be the same in the blood and tissue donor populations, as the populations are so very similar, the overall numbers of tissue donations collected is many orders of magnitude lower than the number of blood donations. Thus it can be argued that the overall probability of actually encountering a donation from a tissue donor who is in the window period, assuming a screening programme with equal if not greater sensitivity, is much lower than that for a blood donation. However, when the actual number of infectious identified in the UK are looked at the incidence of confirmed infected deceased tissue donors is significantly higher than that of blood donors [14], but the denominator is around 3 orders of magnitude less and therefore the figures cannot be compared directly. Furthermore significantly more patients have transfusions, greater number of potential exposures, and it is therefore not necessarily true to argue that tissues are a higher \u201crisk\u201d than blood or other donations.",

            "text": "Overall the current screening of tissue donations prior to release is highly effective at preventing transmitted infections. The basic principles applied to the screening of blood donations do apply as there is considerable overlap in the need to identify low risk donors, the range of transmissible infectious diseases, the screening assays used and the screening strategies developed. Certainly there is little, if any, difference between the screening of surgical tissue donations and blood donations, as the samples are all collected by standard venepuncture from living individuals. The screening of deceased tissue donations is different inasmuch as the nature of the samples is fundamentally different, although the screening assay themselves are the same. It is the reliability of the screening process in relation to deceased samples that needs to be assured, particularly the representativeness of the samples collected in respect of the screening results obtained reflecting the true status of the donor and therefore the donation. In addition consideration should be given to the specific screening algorithms used, as those commonly used for blood donation screening may not always offer the most appropriate approach for the screening of deceased tissue donations. The issue of specificity is something that has particular relevance as the unnecessary loss of tissue donations due to poor specificity is unacceptable because tissue products are generally in shorter supply, often with many potential recipients on waiting lists. Furthermore a cadaver may provide a large number of different tissues for clinical use, and a non-specific screening result would result in the loss of a significant number of clinically valuable products.",
