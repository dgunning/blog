            "text": "Avian flu has begun to capture the imagination of world publics in recent years as the H5N1 virus spread from its perceived origin in East and Southeast Asia to Turkey and potentially to Western Europe (Davis 2005). Newspapers and television corporations have discovered the pandemic as a topic of interest. Governments, businesses, and civic organizations at all scales have drawn up preparedness plans. This newfound interest in the threat from emerging infectious disease has a recent precedent. In the spring of 2003 many parts of the world experienced an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).\n1\n In many ways, the SARS outbreak is now being read as a stage rehearsal for what many public health experts believe will be a much larger epidemic once the H5N1 virus, which has so far only spread from infected birds to humans, mutates and leads to direct human\u2010to\u2010human infection. SARS, a previously unknown disease, is much different from H5N1 but the way it was handled by health authorities around the globe can potentially teach us some lessons about future pandemic preparedness. This article looks at the urban governance aspect of these lessons. We rely on the rich and productive output in urban governance studies but will argue that this literature has had a particular blind spot: the relationship of urban governance restructuring to emerging infectious disease (EID). Urban governance must be prepared to deal with infectious disease. At the same time, global health governance overall may be improved by realizing the possibilities that rest in metropolitan governance. A new \u201cpost\u2010Westphalian\u201d constellation of post\u2010national state power (Fidler 2004) poses previously unknown demands on the governance of urban regions in the area of infectious disease control. While there has been much attention in recent years on the significance of global city regions in the new world economy (Brenner and Keil 2006) and while the governance and regulation of these regions has captured the imagination of academics and policymakers alike (Buck et al 2005; Harding 2005; Heinelt and K\u00fcbler 2005; Kantor and Savitch 2005; Scott 2001), little has been said specifically about the growing pressures posed by the potential threat of infectious disease through the global network on urban governance. Rather than operating solely in between the often contradictory challenges of social cohesion and economic competitiveness, urban governance may soon have to be more centrally concerned with questions of widespread disease, life and death (Agamben 1998) and the construction of new internal boundaries and regulations just at the time that globalization seems to suggest the breakdown of some traditional scalar incisions such as national boundaries. In making connections between the traditional discussion of public service provision between competitiveness and cohesion and the more dramatic and urgent questions about disease and health, life and death, we also consult work that has\u2014in a Foucauldian manner\u2014more directly engaged with issues of (bio)power and governmentality (Osborne and Rose 1999; Rose 1999).\n2\n\n",

Some work has explored the historical precedents of variations in how cities have fought infectious disease in order \u201cto help us plan for the battles against disease that will be part of our future\u201d (Leavitt 2003:192). Howard Markel has put forward the observation that \u201c[n]othing less than a cooperative partnership of nations, healthcare professionals, researchers, public health specialists, concerned corporations, philanthropies, and individuals will suffice to safeguard the world against the many public health problems we face today\u201d (2004:211\u2013212). Still, we believe more specific work needs to be done clarifying and determining the role municipal institutions of health governance can play in the global system of health governance.",

            "text": "It is possible to view the SARS outbreak of 2003 as a direct consequence of increased connectivity due to globalization in general and advances in transportation technologies in particular (Brockmann, Hufnagel and Geisel 2005; Guimera et al 2005). In order to understand the effects of connectivity in the global city system on the health of people in these cities, it is necessary to develop new and innovative ways of thinking about what is connected in what ways in that system (Ali and Keil 2006). There is a strong and growing consensus in the literature on globalization and health/disease that realities in a post\u2010Westphalian world need a rethinking of governance structures on a variety of scales between the global and the local (Ali and Keil forthcoming; Fidler 2004; Gandy 2005b; Harris and Seid 2004a; Knobler et al 2004; Lee 2002; Markel 2004; McLean et al 2005; Whiteford and Manderson 2000). In this article, we ask what the consequences of the connectivity for health governance will be. Although public health policy delivery has always been an intensely local process, the \u201cWestphalian\u201d state system had defined health policies in national containers ordered and segmented among others by World Health Organization guidelines but mostly under the sovereign jurisdiction of nation\u2010states. Public health was national health and health policy was national health policy under this regime. WHO interventions had to occur in the framework of national sovereignties, whose concern was with both popular health and economic welfare\u2014not necessarily in this order (Fidler 2004; Heymann 2005; Heymann interview, Geneva 27 September 2005). When SARS hit major metropolitan regions in Asia and North America the need to rethink both global and sub\u2010national health governance was exposed. The reliance on the hierarchical and hermetic system of nationally based health policy was put to the test as the WHO attempted to carve out a novel activist role in protecting global health beyond national interests and as sub\u2010national governments, economic and civil society players moved to react to a localized global health crisis with coordinated action of their own (Abraham 2004; Fidler 2004). At both ends of the redefinition of international health governance\u2014the local and the global\u2014an \u201cinstitutional void\u201d (Hajer 2003) existed which could not be filled automatically by traditional, national health governance institutions and their international affiliates.",

            "text": "We posit that urban governance will increasingly have to deal with questions of vulnerability and risk related to EIDs. Vulnerability to EIDs is perhaps more pronounced in urban areas, where the majority of us live. Urbanization increases the statistical odds that microbes are being spread (Pennington 2003). The aggregation of human populations into high\u2010density urban \u201cislands\u201d has important effects in providing the host reservoirs for maintaining infection chains (Haggett 1994). Accelerated land use changes in and around urban areas have heightened the vulnerability of urban populations to infectious disease (Patz et al 2004). Vulnerability is a notion which in close proximity to other \u201cessentializing\u201d western discourses such as tropicality and development (Bankoff 2001). It refers to a state outside of the west. Yet, the notion of vulnerability has taken on renewed significance after September 11, particularly in the USA, as the \u201csense of security of many American citizens\u201d was punctured (Simon 2004:41). It has particular relevance to the case of SARS which shattered the local public health and hospital systems of Toronto, Hong Kong and Singapore and the public perception of their safety. These cities' \u201cglobality\u201d means that an infectious disease cannot be contained by a purely exclusive \u201clocal\u201d strategy of public health. Most vulnerability reduction policies tend to be largely limited to making safety modifications to key buildings and critical infrastructures, but the SARS case illustrates that the human/cultural dimension must also be considered in the effective management of disease outbreaks in the contemporary global city. Thus, isolation and quarantine did appear effective in fighting the outbreak, but what more could be done to prepare such containment strategies in case of future outbreaks in the global city? It is clear that we need to better understand the interactions of local modes of healthcare regulation in a globalized urban environment and the specific dimensions of urban vulnerability to public health threats in the global city setting (D'Cunha 2003, 2004).",

            "text": "Global cities are usually considered a specific category of urban centres. They often have more to do with each other than with their immediate hinterlands and regions, and they tend to be more like other global cities than like other cities in their national networks (for an overview of the literature, see Brenner and Keil 2006). As the case of SARS demonstrated, global cities are not just switching stations for flows of capital and labour allegedly ordered in a tight network of privilege and command functions. They also are transfer stations of various and contradictory dynamics of the globalized economy. Among them are city\u2013country relations, connections between the developed and the developing world, even human\u2013animal interrelations (Brenner and Keil 2006; Sassen 2002; Taylor 2004). The SARS virus is said to have travelled to Toronto from Hong Kong through a chain of connectivities\u2014or to use another term, an actor network\u2014that includes the civet cat, live (\u201cwet\u201d) animal markets, cross\u2010border commuters across the spectrum of the labour market, hotels, transnational travellers, airports, healthcare workers, hospitals, etc. Contributing factors were faulty or badly maintained aeration and plumbing systems in high\u2010rise buildings, air travel in hermetically closed airplanes, hospital systems, diasporic relations among relatives, and so forth. At each link of this rather disparate chain, sub\u2010connectivities are present, which we have called the capillaries of the global system: family relationships, small and parochial religious communities, more or less isolated (and even criminalized) food\u2010handling practices, hospital hygiene codes, etc, all sub\u2010realities of a larger global network of relationships. These sub\u2010realities are often not accounted for in descriptions of global cityness although they seem to be central to our understanding of certain consequences of globalization, such as the spread of EIDs. They are not just the micro versions of larger macro processes constituted elsewhere: they are co\u2010constitutive of the global realities themselves. Insofar as they belong to the larger processes of metabolism, these sub\u2010realities are part of the ecological substrate of the global city system. We argue that it is exactly the dialectics of fixed infrastructures, built environments, institutional arrangements, reliable legal constructs, functioning hospitals (and their governance arrangements) of global cities on one hand and the unfixed, mobile, constantly re\u2010articulated flows of people, non\u2010human organisms, information and things that move through them, on the other.\n3\n Recognizing this dialectic also implies the critique of functionalistic and technological images of global connectivity in fixed network nodes. We rather postulate the topological, agency\u2010founded co\u2010constitution of such nodes (Ali and Keil 2006; Gandy 2005a; Smith 2003).",

            "text": "Urban governance has become a standard phrase in urban political studies. Following Jon Pierre, urban governance can be defined as \u201cthe pursuit of collective goals through an inclusive strategy of resource mobilization\u201d (2005:449). As the focus of urban scholars has moved from \u201cthe comparative study of constitutions and city charters\u201d to decision\u2010making processes that involve state, market and civil society actors in all areas (Gissendanner 2003:663), a broad spectrum of urban governance research has now been produced with case studies, comparisons and further theoretical developments (see, for example, Brenner 2004; Elwood 2004; Harding 2005, forthcoming; Heinelt and K\u00fcbler 2005; Kantor and Savitch 2005; Kaufmann, L\u00e9autier and Mastruzzi 2005; Pierre 2005; Sellers 2005). North\u2010America\u2010centred work on urban regimes, which continues to produce excellent case and comparative studies (for a recent summary of this literature see Stone 2005) is complemented by a strong European\u2010centred body of work of mostly comparative nature (Brenner 2004; Buck et al 2005; LeGales 2002). In some of the literature, the shift to governance has been discussed in relation to the globalization and neoliberalization of cities, processes which in many cases have been seen as causative of this shift (Brenner and Theodore 2002), while other authors have emphasized the role governance has itself played in facilitating these processes in turn. The comparative literature on urban governance restructuring has various intersections with the rescaling of the \u201cpolitical pathology\u201d of infectious disease containment (Fidler 2004) as the global and neoliberal contexts of current restructuring at the urban scale have been the focus of much theoretical and conceptual work. Of these intersections, the new focus of metropolitanization deserves our specific attention. Brenner's central concern, for example, is with the ways in which \u201curban governance has served as a major catalyst, medium, and arena of state rescaling processes\u201d (2004:174). New collective action at the city\u2010regional level in the many traditional (e.g. economic development and social welfare) and emerging (e.g. environmental, (multi\u2010)cultural) policy fields can be discerned in metropolitan areas around the world. Public policymaking increasingly occurs at the metropolitan level as municipal and regional elites deliberately nurture this scale as the basis for international competition (Boudreau et al forthcoming; Brenner 2004). Yet, there is also an emerging political space at the metropolitan scale, where collective action and claims for local democracy unfold. Metropolitanization can mean an internal reconstitution of the political sphere and its articulation with civil society: \u201cThere is a diversification of local responsibilities and activities, from the production of local services to, among other things, a proactive role in economic development\u201d (Boudreau et al forthcoming). Among these responsibilities and activities may also be health governance at the urban scale.",

            "text": "There is ample scholarship on the historical relationship between municipal government and disease both historically and on recent developments, such as the reemergence of TB, the role of urban poverty and diversity vis\u2010\u00e0\u2010vis disease or the ravages of AIDS (see, for example, Craddock 2000; Gandy and Zumla 2003; Raphael 2004; Shah 1997). Yet despite an increased interest in the relationship of globalization and disease (McMurray and Smith 2001), there has not been much attention on the specific urban governance aspects of EIDs in a world characterized by globalizing and global cities. We will argue accordingly that in the face of new threats to the health of urban dwellers caused both by increased technological, economic, cultural and ecological connectivity (globalization) and healthcare restructuring (neoliberalization), we need a renewed focus on the city as a place of potential or real disease and inversely as a place of health. An exception to the dearth of work conceptualizing health and disease as part of the overall governance of world cities has been the research of Victor Rodwin and Michael Gusmano (2002) on public health infrastructure\n4\n in New York, London, Paris and Tokyo. While not explicitly locating their work in the governance literature, Rodwin and Gusmano (2002:445) have noted: \u201cUrban health evokes contrasting images: the city as a center of disease, poor health, and enduring poverty versus the city as a cradle of historical public health interventions, innovative medical cures, and healthy lifestyles for the well\u2010to\u2010do\u201d. Studying \u201curban health, particularly the evolution and current organization of public health infrastructure and the health status and quality of life in these cities\u201d and the \u201cimportant links between local, subnational, and central or federal authorities\u201d (ibid:446) sounds familiar to students of urban governance. Rodwin and Gusmano have shown the impact of global cityness on localized health governance mechanisms and systems. In their work on New York, London, Paris, and Tokyo, Rodwin and Gusmano (2002:446) have examined the impacts of \u201cworld cities\u2014their health system and neighborhood characteristics\u2014on two outcomes: the use of health services and health status\u201d. They found, not surprisingly perhaps, great diversity in which health is factored into the overall global city formation in these four leading global urban centres. Their ongoing studies on various aspects of the public health system in these cities reveal the connections between common structural inequalities and social problems in global cities with their health systems. This work fills a void in the research on global cities generally and specifically adds to our understanding of the impact of globally induced social inequality\u2014ie global city formation\u2014on health. It also has the added benefit of being able to help us differentiate between the various health governance systems in cities as diverse as London, Paris, New York and Tokyo both in their centres and peripheries. Rodwin and Gusmano have identified four distinct \u201conerous health risks\u201d, which global cities such as Toronto, Hong Kong and Singapore confront: the re\u2010emergence of infectious diseases; rising inequalities among social groups; barriers in access to quality healthcare by ethnic minorities and/or the poor; and terrorism and bioterrorism (2002:449). All four themes stretch the notion of the city as a defined territorialized place. They point to cities as sites of topological relations that articulate activities and dynamics at various scales (Amin and Thrift 2002). They define, to a large degree, the agenda of global city health governance. Yet, as much as Rodwin and Gusmano's own research sheds light on the place\u2010related aspects of health, it does not itself deal with the network\u2010related aspects of health which is the aspect emphasized in the current article.",

            "text": "We suggest adding two important dimensions of the analysis which we believe increase our understanding of the role of urban health governance in the fight against EIDs. First, the governance of cities today is unimaginable without the modern constitution of the \u201cbacteriological city\u201d at its base (Gandy 2005a, [Link]), which created managerial processes of a technological, engineering and scientific nature to guarantee public health and to lay the foundation of an economic development and demographic growth ostensibly unencumbered by the incalculable onset of disease outbreaks, which had wrecked urban populations and their economies until the twentieth century in Europe and North America. It is on the basis of this century\u2010old history that we now need to rethink urban health governance. A historical process of purification separated the modern city from its natural environments through a set of infrastructures and mechanized metabolic processes such as water and sewer infrastructure, garbage collection and processing, etc (Kaika 2004). The \u201cbacteriological city\u201d as Matthew Gandy (2004, 2005a, [Link]) has called the city of the twentieth century, was based on an entirely human\u2010centred purified science, which \u201cothered\u201d animals, externalized disease and\u2014in extreme cases\u2014eliminated \u201cless\u2010than\u2010human\u201d humans through technical ingenuity and government biopolitics (Foucault 1999). The bacteriological city kept the germs in check and allowed for new types of socially cohesive urban relations to take shape: \u201cThe emerging \u2018bacteriological city\u2019 involved a medley of different social, political, economic and environmental goals set within the context of a movement away from fragmentary and laissez\u2010faire approaches to urban governance\u201d (Gandy 2004:367). This rationalization of urban governance via technologically reliable networks was based on a universalist interest in public health advances. The currently popular \u201cneoorganicist\u201d view of the city, of which the materialist notion of the cyborg city is a critical extension, puts a new spin on the tradition of the bacteriological city. It has been strongly associated with a transhumanist view of our urban reality, in which, as Bruce Braun observes, \u201c\u2018barely human\u2019 others (Iraquis, Rwandans, Muslims), and \u2018almost human\u2019 companions (monkeys, dogs and cats), are discussed alongside accounts of \u2018inter\u2010species\u2019 exchange (bird flu, SARS) in which the boundaries of the human are suddenly porous and mobile\u201d (2004:269). Such mixing clearly has consequences for governance as the carefully guarded distinctions between people and germs, materialized in the modern bacteriological city, are now being challenged unexpectedly. As a consequence, we now need to figure out collectively where to draw the kinds of regulative boundaries, which we humans may need to survive the imagined or real onslaught of the germs. And such defensiveness is most likely tied up with the regulation of bodies\u2014human and nonhuman\u2014that carry or are suspected to carry the disease. Technically, while not necessarily ethically, the sacrifice of millions of ducks or cattle as a reactive of preventative public health measure, is the same kind of measure as airport screening for foot and mouth disease and SARS and quarantine of suspected bodies in cities. Braun challenges us to think that it is:",

Our argument is that while purification and biopolitics were the characteristics associated with the hygienic city of the last century, we have now entered a phase in which the potential reemergence of infectious disease at a mass scale forces us to rethink the relationship of our built environments, our institutional arrangements and our practices as urban dwellers. This has to do as much with the changing nature of cities as basing points of the global economy\u2014to use quite a conventional concept from global cities theory\u2014as with the kinds of reemerging diseases we now have to deal with.",

In addition, cities like Toronto are tied into an increasingly diverse global network of diaspora and migrant cultures at the base of their hybrid globality (Goonewardena and Kipfer 2005). The connection between the globalizing political economy and the cultural and demographic changes it brings with it are crucial to understanding the everyday practices and socio\u2010cultural interactions that characterize today's world and more specifically the everydayness of global cities. Toronto\u2014like other cities in the global city network and elsewhere\u2014has taken on far\u2010reaching responsibilities for the settlement of immigrants. This has become a central concern of metropolitan governance now. As in past waves of immigration, cities have become the actual border points for new immigrants. It is important to remember, as Nicholas King has reminded us, that under these circumstances, \u201cresearchers and public health officials would do well to think in transnational as well as international terms. This means focusing less on the transgression of borders by individuals, and more on the formation of transnational connections between spaces and populations once thought to be disconnected or insulated from one another\u201d (2003:53).",

The experience with SARS points to an interesting dialectics: the existing system is both corroded and withstands the onslaught of the virus. Speaking about the US, Fidler states, \u201cFederalism constructs political borders between federal and state governments. Germs no more recognize these borders than they recognize international borders. Federalism does not, however, disappear as an influence on public health governance simply because germs do not recognize the boundaries it creates\u201d (2003:486). Fidler's \u201cpolitical pathology\u201d is pivotal for the understanding of the parameters of health governance today. He carefully charts the landscape of international and now global health governance since the nineteenth century, when the first International Sanitary Regulations were drawn up among the great powers of the world.\n6\n These efforts eventually led to the creation of a world health agency, the WHO, which has operated on a set of tenuous global regulations such as the International Health Regulations, which have recently undergone redrafting to reflect the specific challenges posed by the fight against SARS (Fidler 2004). The weakness of Fidler's otherwise sharp analysis is that it focuses only on one direction of the rescaling of international health governance towards the global level. In answering the question \u201chow to manage borderless bugs in a borderless world\u201d, Fidler concentrates on the role of new global institutions as well as new non\u2010state actors in the health field. Both, he correctly states, narrow the traditional sovereign spaces of health policymaking, even of large states such as China which\u2014begrudgingly\u2014ceded some of its authority to the WHO during the SARS crisis after initially lying to the world about the severity of the disease in its provinces and in the nation's capital. The WHO emerged as a stronger and more recognized player from the SARS crisis and established, for the first time and if only briefly, a global community of EID management (Fidler 2004:126; Heymann 2005; Preiser 2005). Fidler does not engage with other forms of the rescaling of the Westphalian state system such as the one Brenner has defined as \u201cmetropolitanization\u201d (Brenner 2004). We have been arguing throughout this article that this metropolitan scale of governance deserves more attention in the regulation of an urban\u2010based global reality. In fact, as the former Director General of the WHO underlined, \u201cWHO officials every day deal with local communities and officials, around the world\u201d (Brundtland, email interview 1 November 2005).",

Not only is it not true for most cities in the world where people keep being threatened by infectious disease pandemics of all kinds, it is also not true for western cities anymore as SARS has shown in utmost clarity. We do agree with Osborne and Rose, though, when they point out that the governmentality that regulates disease has shifted from the collective to the individual.\n7\n This is a major biopolitical shift which is mostly played out on the level of urban governance. This interpretation coincides with other work on the changing nature of public health (Petersen and Lupton 1996), which argues that health and disease have been recast as individual responsibilities rather than social ones in the contemporary period [see also Sanford and Ali (2005) for an elaboration of this argument with respect to SARS]. It is exactly this\u2014neoliberal\u2014governmentality of individualized notions of health and sickness which existed when SARS arrived. It is in this framework that we have to understand the new thinking and agency around infectious disease in the city. It adds to the general shift in the current city from traditional notions of control in favour of a more clearly orchestrated mix of state and market interventions. Public health governance in the age of SARS has\u2014at least potentially\u2014moved to a bundle of strategies that fit well into the overall securitization of urban society which includes \u201cenhanced forms of social control through a mix of architectural, ideological and intelligence\u2010gathering processes\u201d (Gandy 2005a:33). In addition to these developments towards a new governmentality of public health, the SARS crisis occurred in a very specific environment, which had been created by the events that followed the attacks on Washington and New York City on September 11, 2001.",

            "text": "Shortly after September 11, 2001, American Vice President Dick Cheney was reflecting on what he called a \u201cnew normalcy\u201d, a notion that was used widely at the time to legitimize changes to long\u2010held understandings of the social and legal makeup of American society (Lawyers Committee for Human Rights 2003). Legal scholars and practitioners as well as political pundits and activists of all stripes pondered the meaning of the \u201cnew normal\u201d and pointed to the deterioration of basic human and civil rights in the aftermath of the September 11 and subsequent war\u2010related events. \u201cLiving\u201d in the \u201cnew normal\u201d became an object of serious study (Simon 2004). A legal study examined such changes in the areas of \u201cgovernment openness; personal privacy; immigration; security\u2010related detention; and the effect of US actions on human rights standards around the world\u201d (ibid). While admitting to the necessity of some government action in the wake of 9/11, the report notes \u201cdramatic changes in the relationship between the US government and the people it serves\u201d and voices many grave concerns about the deterioration of civic and individual liberties. Beyond its immediate denotation with respect to the changing times after 9/11, the term has since thrived as a powerful (if somewhat clich\u00e9d) metaphor that has been bandied about in all kinds of contexts. And despite the clearly problematic context in which \u201cthe new normal\u201d was introduced into the political and vernacular vocabulary\u2014or perhaps precisely because of the implications of this context\u2014the term found a wide use in Toronto's SARS outbreak of 2003. During the crisis politics of the day, particularly in the healthcare system itself and among the politicians involved, \u201cthe new normal\u201d quickly became the buzzword for an overall state of emergency that gave policy actors and decision\u2010makers license to make unprecedented changes and to call for reform of major threads of the social fabric, particularly in the area of public health. The \u201cnew normal\u201d became the umbrella term for a situation in which thousands were put into quarantine (or if they resisted into isolation), and nurses\u2014many of whom were infected themselves\u2014were missing from understaffed hospitals, at a time when the overall system of healthcare delivery was admittedly about to \u201csnap\u201d (Boyle 2003). One of the main users of the concept was the ultra\u2010conservative Minister of Health for Ontario, Tony Clement, who, for a moment, surfed on the popular wave of the Giuliani\u2010brand \u201croll\u2010up\u2010your\u2010sleeve\u201d and \u201copen\u2010shirt\u2010collar\u201d politics of emergency, which swept him into the public spotlight in the spring of 2003. Clement became the public face of a social crisis which had repercussions for much more than health policy per se, and touched on issues involving labour relations, \u201crace\u201d relations, multiculturalism and much more. The \u201cnew normal\u201d soon became the yardstick for all these types of issues. For instance, in a dispute with nurses about the lack of full\u2010time positions and the potential change to the funding formula, Clement said on 6 May 2003: \u201cIn the \u2018new normal\u2019 those kinds of things would have to be reviewed through the prism of infection control\u201d.\n8\n Around the same time, Clement's Ministry issued a \u201cBackgrounder\u201d in which the \u201cnew normal\u201d was \u201ccharacterized by high standards of practice that reflect a heightened awareness of emerging infectious diseases including SARS\u201d and where there is mention of a \u201c\u2018new normal\u2019 environment\u201d, in which healthcare workers are meant to operate.\n9\n One set of directions for the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Toronto dated 2 June 2003, stated self\u2010reflexively:",

The \u201cnew normal\u201d changed both the horizon of expectation, which citizens, users of the healthcare system, travellers, etc may have had and the potential range of action for governments in dealing with the crisis. It has led, at a remarkable rate, to a lowering of democratic potential in the making and practice of policy, in this case health. The rights of both patients and healthcare workers were considerably cut back during the Toronto SARS crisis. This is true precisely because the crisis transformed a group of previously relatively obscure public health officials and politicians into a group of well\u2010known leadership personalities\u2014Donald Low, Marcia Taylor, Doris Greenspun, Colin D'Cunha, Sheila Basrur, Tony Clement, James Young\u2014who took care of democracy while it was dormant in the shadow of the \u201cnew normal\u201d.

Lastman, ignorant of the context of global health governance in which \u201chis\u201d city found itself and apparently unfamiliar with the WHO, spouted out venom against the UN organization which, in his eyes, unduly interfered with Toronto's self\u2010governance.\n12\n These actors/agents were put on stage by the arrival of the virus and they played \u201ccrisis\u201d and invented a new mode of governance as they went along. While they were by no means unprepared for the epidemic, public officials joined regular citizens in performing a disease that no one yet knew.

The ideological precepts of the \u201cnew normal\u201d enabled the state to reassert itself as an active participant in public life after neoliberal reforms in Ontario had stripped its involvement in many areas of public welfare to the bare minimum and to reinsert itself with some legitimacy in a policy community which had learned to not trust a government that had de\u2010funded public institutions such as healthcare and education at an unprecedented scale (Keil 2002). This kept the Ontario government \u201cin the game\u201d at a critical time\u2014at least until such measures were challenged by the general public, healthcare workers' associations, patients and their relatives and the press.\n13\n The loss of clear boundaries for jurisdictions is, of course, a direct outgrowth of global city formation and the growing incapacity of the (local) state in particular to deal with crises visited upon an urban region by its growing internationalization (Friedmann [1986] 1995). The growing challenge presented by global city formation to the fiscal and institutional capacity of the local state is exacerbated by the processes invoked by Hajer but also by the ongoing re\u2010scaling of political spaces in a rapidly changing world. Specifically with respect to global cities, it has been noted that conceptually and pragmatically the business of municipal politics as well as the conduct of everyday life has been both de\u2010localized in profound ways through economic and cultural globalizations, and re\u2010localized through the idiosyncracies of topologies, which bring together the myriad social connectivities in the microcosms of the world's urban centres (Smith 2003).",

Urban governance in Toronto had been characterized by the city's forced amalgamation in 1997, which initially changed the landscape of public policy significantly towards a more competitive, coercive and stratified environment. This coincided with fundamental changes to municipal politics and internal governance processes as the city has been trying to establish a sense of harmonized \u201cgood government\u201d and civic engagement after amalgamation. The outcome of these processes was contradictory: on the one hand hardcore neoliberal reforms were rolled out and downloaded by the Tory provincial government between 1995 and 2003 and often followed through by a conservative and boosterist mayor Mel Lastman who was unapologetically the spokesperson of an aggressive business lobby and particularly the development industry; on the other hand, progressive politicians at the municipal level with the support of a continuously active social and environmental movement sector, the public sector unions and an electorate which had not forgiven the Tories for their attack on Toronto political traditions. The result of these contradictions was that urban governance in Toronto at the time of the SARS outbreak was split as continued reform in the municipal administration, and certain \u201cforgotten\u201d policy areas such as food, homelessness the environment\u2014and public health\u2014 competed with neoliberal development mantra of a business elite which began to use the newly amalgamated city as their strategic terrain for interurban competition. Inside the municipal administration, departmental restructuring and harmonization had led to insecurity, at least temporarily, as to the procedures and substance of urban policy when political cultures of suburban jurisdictions were melded with the downtown's more progressive, democratic traditions, which had led to more sustained rights claims of more diverse populations. This progressive city/conservative suburb split in the geography of Toronto's urban governance was challenged by the new immigration and settlement patterns, which made suburbs more diverse than the inner city and the inner city potentially less dynamic politically than the multiculturally invigorated suburbs. During the time of the SARS outbreak, this shift complicated matters significantly as the crisis was played out in geographic and social areas of the city\u2014Scarborough and North York\u2014which remained largely terrae incognitae to the old Toronto elite.",

They specifically argue that there has been a mix of old and new measures at various scales that was pervasive and that overall a new hegemony around new epidemiological techniques, risk management, morality and security took shape. Extending this work to the specific context of urban governance, a number of preliminary observations can now be made in order to characterize the urban health governance challenges identified in Toronto during and after the SARS outbreaks of 2003. The urban health governance system experienced a very specific set of pressures, which spoke to the kinds of fundamental decisions that have to be made by urban\u2010scaled and municipal authorities in a moment of epidemic disease. Affonso, Andrews and Jeffs (2004:573\u2013574) have perceptively identified three sets of paradoxes that led to three sets of dilemmas in the governance of the SARS outbreak. These paradoxes/dilemmas were, first, that healthcare workers became sources of transmission and active sustainers of the SARS case matrix (leading to the dilemma to be forced to decide whose safety gets priority: patients or caregivers?). Second, hospitals were sources of SARS infection in the community, breaking down the boundaries of medical care and community in threatening ways (leading to the question of how far do providers of healthcare have to go to provide safe spaces?). Third, a culturally and ethnically diverse city may be particularly vulnerable to infectious diseases (prompting the question about the relationship of civil liberties and disease control). In terms of urban governance, these three couples of paradoxes and dilemmas denote spatio\u2010institutional uncertainties of a new kind, which challenge traditional modes of integration and regulation of economic institutions (labour markets/work places), specialized functional spaces (hospitals), public institutions (public health agencies), codified private behaviours (patient versus citizen rights), etc. In an urban governance model, questions need to be directed at the particular ways through which state action (public health, security, etc), private sector involvement (providers of masks, medical equipment, drugs, etc.) and civic organizations (ethnic initiatives against racism, protection of workers' rights, etc) and individual civil rights claims (patients, quarantined individuals, travellers, etc) are coordinated by whom, at what scale and with what procedural democratic means. Affonso, Andrews and Jeffs (2004) make a number of incisive and plausible recommendations as to how to improve health governance in future outbreaks of the kind endured in 2003 which centre around patient safety and workforce safety, spatial profiling and risk assessment, as well as community mobilization (2004:574\u2013577).",

The core dilemmas these processes would face in the reality of current Canadian municipalism is first the lack of autonomy local agencies have in the face of an unreformed federalism, which sees cities (and their institutions) as mere units of the administrative state (of the province and Canada) and not as political decision\u2010makers on their own terms; and second the tremendous weakening of lower state and governance structures\u2014often despite rhetorical statements to the contrary on the effect of devolution and subsidiarity\u2014in the face of the globalization and neoliberalization of the Canadian state, including the increasing porosity towards supra\u2010national institutions such as the WHO.",

The former provincial medical officer of health, Colin D'Cunha, \n15\n (2004), detailed the various lessons learned from the outbreak, mostly through the lens of health reporting. The provincial scale is extremely important in the Canadian system where municipalities are dependent on upper level policy frameworks and financing without much autonomy for local agencies and institutions. Urban governance is severely constricted and clearly defined by this situation. While the municipal state may also be the most politicized of the three levels of government, it remains under the tight supervision of the province in particular and while state expenditures have risen consistently since the 1950s in the federal and provincial governments, municipal funds have not kept pace with the demands placed on them through decades of downloading and devolution (Villeneuve and S\u00e9guin, 2000). D'Cunha, whose provincial agency was responsible for 37 local health units in Ontario, notes in particular that the Reportable Disease Information System in place when SARS hit, had been introduced in the 1980s. A new system of reporting, the Integrated Public Health Information System (IPHIS), although available since early in the century, was only to be implemented in the spring of 2003 and was further delayed through SARS. The provincial level system of surveillance was tied in with the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN). The provincial Health Protection and Promotion Act (HPPA) makes mandatory disease reporting and control. It was amended after the SARS crisis to empower the province to facilitate isolation of infected individuals (D'Cunha 2004). D'Cunha's office was also left in dire straits in the wake of serious de\u2010funding of public health institutions at the provincial level under a Tory government after 1995. The provincial health authority appeared very much like an empty shell which had coordinating functions of local authorities but could not muster the resources to do a good job giving direction and provide credible leadership to municipal and regional agencies (interview, Associate Medical Officer of Health\u2014Toronto, October 2005).",

The SARS crisis posed a significant stress on the already severely compromised public health system of Toronto as other public health services were cut or reduced to \u201cessential services only\u201d (ibid:23\u201324). The kinds of measures under the responsibility of the municipal public health hegemony reflect the temporally layered and overlapping traditions stemming from the \u201cbacteriological city\u201d, updated and redefined through more recent developments. The point to note in this respect is the often confusing unevenness in measures from various periods, phases, and moments of urban governance, which were haphazardly re\u2010grouped into a recombinant mix of place\u2010specific sets of trials and errors. While the coercive and enabling qualities of an existing municipal public health system were tested daily with unexpected twists in the proliferation of the disease, a new administrative reality emerged in the shadow of the successes and failures of an iterative policy process. Cases of temporal unevenness were, for example, the deployment of quarantine and isolation orders for the first time in 50 years (with no living administrative memory of and hence no experiential knowledge with such measures in the system) and the much younger (but failing) 14\u2010year\u2010old provincially authorized surveillance system (which had not kept pace with both technological advances and procedural necessities that had occurred since its inception) (Basrur et al 2004). The unevenness here related in both cases to the fact that two measures at two ends of a developmental scale in public health measures\u2014the rather traditional and rather blunt tool of the quarantine, and the biopolitical, yet informationalized surveillance\u2014were potentially at odds with the constituencies and clienteles they were meant to protect (and whose general rights sensibilities were a far cry from the mid\u2010twentieth century)\n17\n and, in the case of the failed surveillance, certainly not up to the challenge that the SARS outbreak posed.",

Civil society is dramatically redefined in the context of the \u201cnew normal\u201d. In the immediate crisis in the spring of 2003, it became rapidly clear that the \u201cnew normal\u201d was not just a rewriting of a few hospital protocols and ministry directives. In true fashion of creating a new \u201cgovernmentality\u201d through new \u201ctechnologies of power\u201d in the Foucauldian sense (Osborne and Rose 1999), the \u201cnew normal\u201d became a new standard of societal interaction overall, accepted and even disseminated by the \u201cnormalized\u201d everyday actions of urban residents, and the yardstick of urban governance. As we are writing this, Toronto is going through Emergency Preparedness Week, which calls on everyone to do their part in putting obstacles in the way of harm. The event organizers are clear that they expect citizens to do their part when taking in exhibits under \u201cthe theme \u2018What are your reasons for being prepared?\u2019 The City's exhibits will help Toronto residents increase their awareness of emergency\u2010preparedness issues and answer this question for themselves. Residents will have the chance to speak with representatives from the City's co\u2010ordinated emergency response teams, view emergency equipment, and pick up important personal emergency preparedness literature\u201d (http://www.toronto.ca/wes/techservices/oem/index.htm, accessed 8 May 2007). While civic duty is part of the overall deal, awareness of the possible pitfalls of running a society on an emergency mindset are also part of the public debate.",

Like Brundtland, who was the Director General of the WHO during the SARS crisis, \u201chundreds of thousands of men and women around the world devote their working lives and intellectual creativity to protecting our health\u201d (Markel 2004:210). That they do this in a wide variety of institutions\u2014state and non\u2010state; private sector and civil society based\u2014and that they are crossing boundaries of disciplines and professional practice all the time, is an important insight: the crisis of the nation\u2010state\u2010based system does not lead to a simple replacement of the international by an elusive global system of health governance. Instead, it is the conviction that undergirds this article that certain re\u2010territorializations are key to the reworking of health governance globally. Leading science journalist Laurie Garrett wrote in her prescient Betrayal of Public Trust (2000:567) that \u201c[s]afety \u2026 is as much a local as international issue. In public health terms every city is a \u2018sister city\u2019 with every other metropolis on earth\u201d. Particularly \u201cmetropolitanization\u201d is of great consequence as urban areas have been in the centre of re\u2010emerging diseases such as SARS and TB. On the basis of evidence from the 2003 SARS outbreak in Toronto, Canada, we have argued in this article that more attention needs to be paid to the changing relationships of urban governance and (re\u2010)emerging infectious disease. Towards that end, we specifically looked at two dimensions of urban governance during the SARS crisis. First, the way the legacy of the \u201cbacteriological city\u201d was reinterpreted in the SARS crisis; second, the way in which the local health governance was embedded in a \u201cpost\u2010Westphalian\u201d order of health governance. Through reading these two dimensions against one another, we have discussed how urban governance\u2014under potentially lasting conditions of the \u201cnew normal\u201d\u2014must face the new (or reemerging) challenge of dealing with infectious disease and that global health governance may be better off by taking the possibilities that lie in metropolitan governance more seriously.",

Not only have cities played a major role as sites and conduits of disease, they have also picked up their share of participating in new forms of governance that brings the (local) state back in. Having said that, however, we also showed that both concepts\u2014city and state\u2014are becoming perforated as the \u201cinstitutional void\u201d around emerging infectious disease corrodes firm boundaries between jurisdictional responsibilities of territorial states and city regions. While SARS pricked the skin of the global city system and showed the relative permeability of the Westphalian nation\u2010state order by germs, it reconfirmed a certain rigidity of borders (both external and internal) for human mobility. As global health governance made airports biopolitical switching stations and public health officials reverted to quarantine and other measures of sequestration, the state reaffirmed its power in no uncertain terms. As in the early days of the bacteriological city, when municipal administrations created a physical and social infrastructure of hygiene in the struggle against epidemics, urban governance gets assigned new responsibilities ranging from flu preparedness to surveillance once again. But the city is not what it used to be. In an age of heightened urban unboundedness our image of cities is recast \u201cas nodes that gather flow and juxtapose diversity, as places of overlapping\u2014but not necessarily connected\u2014relational networks, as perforated entities with connections that stretch far back in time and space and resulting from all of this, as spatial formations of continuously changing composition, character and reach\u201d (Amin 2004:34). The new politics of place that Amin sees on the horizon in this new world of perforated urban spaces now also has to take into account the politics of infectious disease we have discussed in this article.",
