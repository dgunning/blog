After clambering from his space capsule after touching down in Inner Mongolia on 16 October, he was hoisted shoulder-high by his ground crew, looking somewhat bemused. Having completed 14 orbits of Earth in a craft based on 1960s-vintage Soviet technology, Yang was lauded by China's state-run media and accorded instant celebrity status. The Beijing Space Medical Institute has even attempted to register his face as a trademark to keep it from appearing on calendars and playing cards.",

It is also a leading player in research, according to a report released in October by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). This placed China third in the global league table of spending on R&D, behind only the United States and Japan, with an annual expenditure of some US$60 billion. What's more, the OECD's figures dated from 2001 \u2014 since when China's investment in fields from stem-cell research to nanotechnology has continued to blossom.",

Labs throughout the West have been filled with eager young Chinese students and postdocs, sent abroad for training.

And in October, China became the first country to license a form of gene therapy for regular clinical use, treating head and neck cancer using the p53 tumour-suppressor gene.",

Instead, an outbreak of a new respiratory disease, which originated in the rural province of Guangdong, made headlines worldwide. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, eventually killed more than 800 people across the globe. Had the virus responsible turned out to be more infectious, the toll could have run into hundreds of thousands. Yet public-health experts believe that the disease might never have become a global threat had Chinese officials not reacted to the outbreak in such a confused and secretive manner.",

Officials eventually came clean in March, after the WHO released a global alert about a mystery form of pneumonia that was, by then, turning up across the world. In the months that followed, the SARS outbreak became a symbol of change in China. In an unprecedented move, the minister of health and the mayor of Beijing were sacked for failing to protect the public. \u201cOfficials in the future will have to think about whether they are doing their job,\u201d says Zihe Rao of Tsinghua University in Beijing, who led a team that determined the structure of an enzyme required for the SARS virus to replicate2.",

But some of the resulting activity has been as chaotic as the initial response to the disease. Zhong estimates that more than 100 different research groups are trying, with little coordination, to produce a SARS vaccine. In November, government officials announced plans to begin testing a vaccine based on live, weakened SARS virus, produced by the Beijing firm Sinovac Biotech. But with so many labs working with the virus, some scientists are concerned about safety. \u201cWe are really worried about the risk of SARS escaping from a laboratory,\u201d says parasitologist Zhao-Rong Lun of Zhongzhan University in Guangzhou.",

The SARS story is symptomatic of a wider failure to tackle public-health issues. Hepatitis B is rampant and AIDS is a growing problem, particularly in Henan province, where tens of thousands of people are thought to have become infected in the 1990s thanks to poor hygiene in a scheme for collecting blood plasma. 'Western' diseases of affluence are also on the rise \u2014 obesity among schoolchildren, for example, has risen ten-fold over the past eight years.",

Presentations at the meeting highlighted the problems of data-falsification and plagiarism \u2014 bold stuff in a country that, until recently, would never have admitted that such misdemeanours take place. Some scientists remain frustrated, however, at the lack of concrete progress towards solving these problems. \u201cThings are not changing fast enough,\u201d laments C. L.
