Negative staining clearly distinguishes the viral particle from the background and provides precise morphological information (concerning symmetry and the presence or absence of an envelope, for example), facilitating the specific identification of viruses, or at least their classification into morphologically similar groups. The use of TEM for viral studies peaked in the 1970s and 1980s, when this technique contributed to the discovery of many clinically important viruses, such as adeno\u2010, entero\u2010, paramyxo\u2010, and reoviruses, all of which were isolated and observed after propagation in cell cultures in vitro. Differences in virus size and fine structure were used as criteria for a more precise classification.7 However, TEM initially failed to detect agents for other diseases, such as hepatitis and gastroenteritis, because the causal viruses could not be propagated in cell cultures in vitro. Nevertheless, the application of TEM to \u201cdirty\u201d clinical samples, such as plasma, urine and feces in the 1970s constituted a major breakthrough for studies of these viruses.8 The etiologic agents of hepatitis B9 and A10 were detected in plasma and stool samples, respectively. The BK virus, a polyomavirus, was identified for the first time in the urine of patients undergoing renal transplantation.11 Rotaviruses were also identified by TEM as the main cause of epidemic gastroenteritis in humans and animals.12, 13 However, many other viruses were also found to cause gastroenteritis. The first of these viruses was the Norwalk virus, identified during an outbreak of gastroenteritis in Norwalk, Ohio, USA.14, 15 Viruses with a similar morphology were subsequently discovered elsewhere and called \u201cNorwalk\u2010like\u201d viruses, to reflect the similarity of their appearance on TEM,16 before being officially renamed \u201cnoroviruses.\u201d17 Other viruses from the adenovirus,18 astrovirus,19, 20 and calicivirus21 families were also identified in the stool samples of children with gastroenteritis. TEM was, thus, widely used on negatively stained samples for routine diagnosis, as a rapid, \u201ccatch\u2010all\u201d method for distinguishing between the diverse viruses potentially implicated in human gastroenteritis, providing a diagnosis within 15 minutes of the arrival of the sample in the laboratory.",

Molecular techniques, with their advantages of greater sensitivity and the capacity to process large numbers of samples easily, replaced TEM in many areas of virological diagnosis. This was the case, in particular, for the diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis, for which molecular techniques capable of identifying most of the virus families involved in human gastroenteritis have been established.24, 25, 26, 27 A similar shift in practice occurred in veterinary medicine, with ELISAs and PCR progressively replacing TEM for the routine diagnosis of viral infections.28, 29, 30, 31 In human medicine, the use of TEM to differentiate between smallpox virus and the other viruses present in the fluids of cutaneous vesicles is no longer required, since the successful eradication of the variola virus in 1980 thanks to a worldwide vaccination program.32 It has been argued that TEM remains potentially useful for this application in a context of bioterrorism.33, 34 However, the risk of smallpox reappearing is extremely small, and even in the unlikely event of this happening, molecular techniques would undoubtedly outperform TEM for this diagnosis. Consequently, the number of laboratories making use of TEM for diagnostic purposes has decreased considerably.",

In most of these cases, TEM was not used to characterize the virus directly in the patient sample, but after isolation of the virus from the clinical sample by propagation in a cell culture in vitro. During an outbreak of fatal respiratory disease in horses and influenza\u2010like illness in humans in Australia in 1995, TEM proved essential for the identification of a previously unknown virus, the Hendra virus, recognized as a member of the Paramyxoviridae family on the basis of its ultrastructure.35 A related virus, the Nipah virus, was also first identified by TEM on cerebrospinal fluid, during an outbreak of encephalitis in Malaysia and Singapore in 1999 in men who had been exposed to pigs.36, 37 The etiology of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic in Hong Kong and Southern China in 2003 was also initially determined by TEM. The causal virus was isolated in several laboratories around the world, by inoculating cell cultures with respiratory specimens, leading to the identification of a coronavirus on ultrathin TEM sections of these cells.38, 39 An outbreak of an unidentified rash in humans, associated with an illness in prairie dogs, occurred in the United States in 2003. TEM revealed the presence of a poxvirus in a cell culture isolate, and this virus was later identified as a monkeypox virus.40 The etiologic agent responsible for an acute severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) in six provinces of China in 2011 was diagnosed through the use of TEM to investigate cells cultured in the presence of blood samples from patients with the disease. TEM revealed the presence of virions with the characteristic morphological features of a bunyavirus.41 RNA sequence analysis revealed that this virus was, indeed, a new member of the genus Phlebovirus in the Bunyaviridae family.",

It was used, for example, in cases of graft dysfunction, fever, and altered mental status in transplant recipients in the United States in 2006. A virus from the Arenaviridae family was observed in ultrathin sections of Vero cells grown in the presence of a cerebrospinal fluid sample from one of these patients.42 PCR was then used to characterize the virus in more detail. It was identified as lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), an arenavirus transmitted by rodents. TEM was also used to identify West Nile virus in a skin specimen from a patient with an enigmatic hemorrhagic fever in the United States43 in 2006. The virus was identified by visualization in ultrathin sections of Vero cells grown in the presence of a homogenate of the skin biopsy specimen. Several cases of bunyavirus infection have also been diagnosed by TEM in patients bitten by mosquitoes or ticks in the United States and presenting with encephalitis44 or fever and fatigue syndrome.45 In Austria, in 2014, TEM identified picornaviruses in the urine samples of a group of neonates, all born at the same hospital and suffering from a sepsis\u2010like illness, after negative results were obtained from the initial microbiological tests.46 TEM also made possible the direct detection, in the brain tissues, of a polyomavirus (the JC virus) responsible for cases of fatal progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, in the absence of viral DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid47 (Figure 2). TEM is still occasionally useful in cases of human gastroenteritis, for the identification of new subtypes of causal viruses such as adenovirus,48 picornavirus,49 or calicivirus50 not recognized by molecular techniques.",

TEM is recommended in the guidelines of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMEA), which also specify the materials to be tested, including cell lines, culture supernatants, and fermenter bulk harvests.67, 68 Although time\u2010consuming and of limited sensitivity, TEM is recommended, in particular, for its \u201ccatch\u2010all\u201d properties, as a complementary approach to in vitro assays and molecular techniques. Current regulations for the use of animal\u2010derived components in biopharmaceutical products stipulate a number of source\u2010testing and manufacturing measures to be implemented, to minimize the potential risk of viral contamination. The in vitro assays for virus detection use a selection of cell lines with history of successful use for the detection of a wide range of potential virus contaminants.69 They can be used in the testing of culture medium in cell banks, and for the testing of raw materials, such as the bovine serum or other animal\u2010derived growth factors used in cell culture. However, infections can occur in cultured cells without a cytopathic effect, and such infections may be missed. Various other molecular assays can be used such as fluorescent product\u2010enhanced reverse transcription (FPERT),70 which is specific for retroviruses, or PCR\u2010based tests if specific risks have been identified during risk evaluation. By combining all these methods, it is possible to cover a broad spectrum of potential contaminants, although it is never possible to provide a 100% guarantee that no unwanted agents are present. In this context, TEM constitutes an additional check in the viral safety testing of biological products as it can document the possible presence of viruses or virus\u2010like particles in master cell banks or fermenter bulk harvests.",

            "text": "Rodent cell lines are widely used for the manufacture of recombinant proteins for pharmaceutical use in humans such as monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, and viral vectors for gene therapy. These cell lines have long been known to contain retroviral elements, because the rodent genome contains many copies of endogenous retrovirus\u2010like sequences.71 Most of the viral particles produced by these cells such as intracytoplasmic or intracisternal A\u2010type particles are defective and noninfectious (Figure 4). However, other particles such as C\u2010type particles bud at the cell surface and may infect nonrodent cells72 (Figure 5). Some murine retroviruses have been shown to be tumorigenic in primates,73 and cases of leukemia have been reported in children with severe combined immunodeficiency treated by gene therapy involving the use of murine retroviral vectors.74 All these elements demonstrate the relevance of tracking the presence of retroviruses in biological products derived from rodent cells. Reverse transcriptase assays performed on bulk harvests are often hampered by high background levels due to cell\u2010derived DNA polymerases.75 TEM may, therefore, help to document the presence of retrovirus\u2010like particles in these bulk harvests (Figure 6). TEM can also be used to gauge the concentration of viral particles to validate the clearance of retroviruses or any other virus suspected to be present in the master cell bank. Fortunately, the endogenous retroviruses present in the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line, the main rodent cell line used to produce biological products in the biotech industry, have been shown to be noninfectious.76 Testing requirements are now lower for this well\u2010characterized cell line than for other cell lines with which experience is more limited. Nevertheless, novel cell substrates, including insect cell lines in particular, are now being introduced into the biotech industry.77 Their use will carry new concerns about unknown viruses for which there is a potential risk of contamination, and TEM will undoubtedly be useful for documenting the presence of viruses or virus\u2010like particles in these cells and the products derived from them.",
