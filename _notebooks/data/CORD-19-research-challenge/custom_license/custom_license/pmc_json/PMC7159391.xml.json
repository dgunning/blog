            "text": "The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a tightly regulated anion channel which mediates cAMP\u2010stimulated salt and fluid secretion and enables efficient mucociliary clearance in the airways. Most CF is caused by the deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 which disrupts the folding, trafficking, gating and surface stability of the mutant. CFTR interactions with other proteins have been studied extensively and it is thought to form protein complexes that localize and stabilize it at the cell surface. Membrane lipids may also play a role in these processes but have received much less attention. We recently showed that wt\u2010CFTR forms sub\u2010resolution clusters that are homogeneously distributed on the plasma membrane of primary human airway epithelial cells. Our studies of CFTR protein dynamics revealed two dynamically distinct populations. One population exhibited small spatial scale transport dynamics and confinement that was dependent on membrane cholesterol suggestive of its localization in lipid rafts. A second population of CFTR molecules had larger spatial scale dynamics indicating CFTR lateral mobility outside the rafts. To better understand the importance of CFTR clustering for its membrane expression and stability and its possible role in CF, we have now compared the aggregation state and lateral mobility of wt\u2010CFTR with F508del\u2010CFTR rescued by treating cells with VX\u2010809. The distribution of wt\u2010 and F508del\u2010CFTR was studied in primary human bronchial epithelial cells using spatial image correlation spectroscopy (ICS). CFTR dynamics were studied using a modified version of k\u2010space image correlation spectroscopy (kICS). To quantify the fraction of wt\u2010CFTR and F508del\u2010CFTR within cholesterol\u2010rich membrane microdomains, and their mobility, transport and partitioning dynamics of these populations were compared under control conditions and following chronic treatment with VX\u2010809 or in combination with the potentiator VX\u2010770. ICS analysis showed that the aggregation state of wt\u2010CFTR is much higher than F508del\u2010CFTR despite treatments with the corrector or in combination with the potentiator. kICS analysis revealed that F508del\u2010CFTR partitions into lipid rafts under control conditions, but the confinement is significantly weaker and a smaller fraction of the population displays confinement when compared with wt\u2010CFTR. VX\u2010809 correction does not restore the normal confined fraction or confined dynamics of F508del\u2010CFTR, neither does the additional potentiation with VX\u2010770, confirming that these treatments do not correct F508del\u2010CFTR membrane behavior. The results show a clear dependence of CFTR distribution and dynamics on cholesterol and suggest that the reduction in F508del\u2010CFTR confinement could be due to an alteration in its interaction with cholesterol which is not restored by CFTR modulators.

A number of endocytic adaptors have been shown to modulate CFTR internalization including Disabled\u20102 (Dab2) (1\u20105). siRNA\u2010mediated knockdown of Dab2 increases plasma membrane abundance of CFTR, highlighting Dab2 as a potential therapeutic target, and the Dab Homology (DH) domain of Dab2 is necessary and sufficient for Dab2 to co\u2010assemble in complex with CFTR.

Hits were validated using pulldown inhibition. Testing of cytotoxicity demonstrates biocompatibility to concentrations as high as 100 mM, suggesting a potential therapeutic window. We measured short\u2010circuit currents (Isc) across polarized monolayers of CF bronchial epithelial cells treated with VX\u2010809 and VX\u2010770 alone or in combination with Dab2\u2010DH inhibitors.

            "text": "Autophagy is a physiological process that helps maintain cellular homeostasis by degrading dysfunctional cellular components, such as misfolded proteins or foreign pathogens, and converting them into useful building blocks, such as amino acids, nucleic acids and lipids. In CF with the F508del mutation, the defective CFTR has previously been shown to induce an upregulation in transglutaminase activity. This enzyme, in turn, drives the crosslinking and the subsequent disabling of Beclin\u20101, a key protein that is needed for autophagy activation. Once autophagy is impaired, there is a corresponding increase in p62. Since p62 has been shown to regulate the aggresome formation, its accumulation effectively traps the F508del\u2010CFTR in the ER and prevents its trafficking to the cell surface. An effective autophagy activator, should, in theory, reverse this sequence of events and allow more of the misfolded CFTR to reach the cell surface. To direct the restoration of autophagy, a fatty acid cysteamine conjugate (CAT\u20105571) was synthesized by first covalently linking cysteamine to the omega\u20103 fatty acid DHA. The sulfhydryl group was then converted into a functionalized disulfide moiety in order to enhance cellular penetration, plasma stability and oral bioavailability. This linking methodology takes advantage of intracellular enzymes to enable the release of two biologically active components (i.e., cysteamine and DHA) inside cells at the same time and in equimolar concentrations. This process allows the simultaneous inhibition of transglutaminase 2 and the upregulation of AMPK to take place and enable a more effective restoration of Beclin\u20101 and autophagy. In cultured primary homozygous F508del hBE cells, the fatty acid cysteamine conjugate CAT\u20105571 synergistically activated autophagy at concentrations as low as 0.3 \u03bcM. This level of activity was observed only with the covalent conjugate and could not be replicated by administering the individual components either individually or in combination, even at much higher concentrations. Once autophagy had been restored in these primary CF hBE cells, an increase in the trafficking of the F508del\u2010CFTR was observed, as noted by an increase in the CFTR band C. When CAT\u20105571 was used in combination with the corrector VX\u2010809 and the potentiator VX\u2010770, it showed an additive effect, as measured by the increase of chloride conductance in a functional assay using cultured primary homozygous F508del hBE cells. CAT\u20105571 is orally bioavailable in the mouse, rat and dog, with drug\u2010like attributes. It represents a potential new therapeutic for the treatment of CF with the F508del mutation.",

Unusually for this family, CFTR operates as an ion channel, rather than a transporter. ABC transporters are thought to operate as pumps by undergoing major structural changes which move the transported allocrite from an inwardly\u2010exposed to outwardly\u2010exposed location within the transmembrane domains (TMDs). This alternating access\u2010type mechanism is coupled to the binding of ATP which triggers the dimerisation of the nucleotide\u2010binding domains (NBDs) followed by ATP hydrolysis and dissociation of the two NBDs, returning the transporter to its starting status (with the TMDs in the inward\u2010facing conformation). For CFTR, ATP binding appears to be required to open the channel (after a prior phosphorylation event) whilst ATP hydrolysis has been associated with channel closure. The disease\u2010causing missense mutation, G551D, appears to greatly reduce the open probability of the channel.",

The data also imply that G551D\u2010CFTR is more stable than the wild\u2010type protein. The structure will be compared with other ABC proteins where high\u2010resolution structures are available and also with the density map of CFTR obtained previously from two\u2010dimensional crystals (Rosenberg MF, et al. J Biol Chem. 2012;286:42647\u201054). In the absence of ATP, the transmembrane domains of G551D\u2010CFTR show an outward\u2010facing configuration, with a deep and wide central channel that is closed on the cytoplasmic side of the TMDs by the intracytoplasmic loops. The NBDs are in a closed dimeric configuration, but density for ATP cannot be observed. Density for the extracellular loops is weak, implying that these regions of the protein are relatively mobile, or disordered in the outward\u2010facing conformation. Regions of density around the NBDs and not accounted for by homologous ABC transporters such as Sav1866 is probably due to the regulatory region (R\u2010region) which must be phosphorylated before channel opening can happen.",

Historically, P67L has been designated a class IV conductance abnormality (i.e., malformed ion pore). In contrast, our studies demonstrate P67L disrupts CFTR protein maturation, prompts misfolding, causes gating defects, and exhibits conductance very similar to wild\u2010type. We also show that P67L CFTR is robustly rescued by lumacaftor or ivacaftor, both in cell lines and primary airway epithelia, although unresponsive to low\u2010temperature correction. To further elucidate the impact of this mutation during protein biogenesis, second\u2010site suppressors R555K or R1070W were introduced in concert with P67L. These experiments, together with pronounced lumacaftor correction and absence of 27\u00b0 C rescue, suggest a model in which P67L is necessary for proper formation of the NBD1/cytosolic loop interface and/or stability of TMD1. Our findings (and those of others) therefore suggest the importance of clinical studies to test pharmacologic correction in CF subjects carrying the P67L defect. We note that lumacaftor rescue of P67L CFTR might not have been anticipated based on previous CFTR class IV assignment. For rare (ultra\u2010orphan) CFTR mutations such as P67L, access to novel therapeutics is often constrained by difficulty arranging phase III clinical trials, and restrictions on off\u2010label use when drug cost is prohibitive. Analysis of low prevalence cystic fibrosis alleles offers a means for assessing barriers to \u201cpersonalized\u201d medicine, and engaging the best available mechanistic knowledge towards treating patients with rare forms of the disease.

            "text": "Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an unique anion channel of the ATP\u2010binding cassette (ABC) superfamily. CFTR consists of two nucleotide\u2010binding domains (NBDs), two membrane\u2010spanning domains (MSDs) and a regulatory (R) domain. CFTR also has alpha\u2010helical extensions and intracellular loops (ICLs) which couple the NBDs and MSDs via \u201ccoupling helices.\u201d The regulation of CFTR channel activity involves protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation at the R domain. However, little is known of the effect of phosphorylation on the intramolecular interactions relating to CFTR channel activation. Previous studies of a similar ABC transporter, BtuCD, have shown that intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence can detect urea\u2010sensitive changes in the coupling between the MSDs and NBDs of full\u2010length BtuCD. Interestingly, we have found that urea\u2010sensitive changes of CFTR were similar to studies of BtuCD and were modified upon PKA phosphorylation. Tryptophan quenching of CFTR was also modified by PKA phosphorylation and suggests this modifies an electrostatic environment of CFTR. Based on CFTR homology models, the ICL:NBD interface has many tryptophans, such as W401 at NBD1, and has a phosphorylation site at Serine\u2010422 which may provide an electrostatic environment. Our biophysical studies then led us to propose that phosphorylation may modify the coupling of ICLs and NBD1 which may be essential for CFTR channel activation. In order to specifically study those interfaces, cysteine crosslinking studies in HEK293 cells were employed using a short membrane\u2010permeable cysteine crosslinker on a CFTR mutant lacking its native cysteine residues (cys\u2010less) with two cysteines engineered at the interfaces of interest. We did not detect any cysteine crosslinking at the ICL1:NBD1 interface with either R170C/W401C or R170C/E476C cys\u2010less WT CFTR. However, we did detect a shift in SDS\u2010PAGE gel migration of all single\u2010 and double\u2010cysteine mutants which suggests that these cysteines may be accessible to crosslinker modification. We were able to detect a specific intramolecular interaction at the ICL4:NBD1 interface with V510C/A1067C cys\u2010less WT CFTR. However, we were unable to detect any changes at the ICL4:NBD1 interface upon PKA phosphorylation. These results were similar to previous studies by He L, et al. (J Biol Chem. 2008;283(39):26383\u201090) which suggest either that the coupling helices of ICL1 and ICL4 are stably interacting with NBD1 regardless of phosphorylation status or that subtle changes in the affinity of this interaction cannot be detected by chemical crosslinking. Consistent with the latter suggestion, our initial studies of disease\u2010causing mutations in the coupling helices of ICL1 and ICL4 show that they exhibit a defect in phosphorylation\u2010dependent channel activation. Together, biophysical studies of reconstituted full\u2010length CFTR protein and cell\u2010based studies of coupling mutants support the hypothesis that such coupling interfaces play a key role in the intramolecular signaling required for CFTR channel regulation.

Combinations of single substitutions acted additively and yielded NBD1 constructs with highly increased thermostability of that domain (results are presented in another poster [Yang et al.]). In the present study, the effects of these NBD1\u2010stabilizing substitutions on the folding and trafficking of full\u2010length wild\u2010type CFTR in a mammalian expression system, and their effects on the monodispersity and thermostability of detergent\u2010purified CFTR, were investigated. Recombinant CFTR proteins containing different combinations of the second\u2010site substitutions were overexpressed in the stable mammalian cell system developed in our lab (Hildebrandt E, et al. Mol Biotechnol. 2015;57:391\u2010405). These CFTR proteins contained a His\u2010affinity purification tag, and extracellular FLAG epitope and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) tags to facilitate fluorescence\u2010activated cell sorting (FACS). FACS analyses of anti\u2010FLAG antibody binding to the extracellular FLAG tag indicated significantly increased levels of cell surface expression of NBD1\u2010stabilizers over that of wild\u2010type CFTR. The CFTR proteins were purified using a protocol optimized in our labs (Hildebrandt E, et al. Biochim Biophys Acta. 2014;1838:2825\u201037). Fluorescence size exclusion chromatography (FSEC) of the purified proteins indicated improved monodispersity of the NBD1\u2010stabilized CFTR protein. Thermal stability of these constructs in detergent solution, as indicated by the unfolding temperature (Tm), was determined by directly monitoring the protein's intrinsic fluorescence or by the fluorescence of an extrinsic dye (SYPRO\u2010orange) as a function of temperature. Unfolding occurred over a broad temperature range between 45\u201075oC which is consistent with the sequential unfolding of several CFTR domains. Most NBD1\u2010stabilizing substitutions also increased the Tm of full\u2010length CFTR, and a positive correlation was observed between their respective unfolding temperatures (Tm\n). Still, a low\u2010temperature transition in the fluorescence signal at \u02dc10\u201020oC is apparent in some data and if this represents an unfolding event in the protein, it may suggest that additional domains besides NBD1 need to be stabilized to further optimize CFTR stability.

Second\u2010site mutations that thermally stabilize NBD1 not only promote the maturation and thermal stability of F508del CFTR but also that of wild\u2010type CFTR, and these strategies have been used to increase the expression and maturation levels of CFTR for its purification and structural studies. Although progress has been made in the purification of more thermally stable CFTR, further improvement is still required to enable high resolution structural analyses. Current methods of monitoring CFTR thermal stability using the most informative biophysical methods such as differential scanning calorimetry require relatively large amounts of purified proteins at high concentrations. In this study, using an engineered cys\u2010less CFTR, we developed a maleimide fluorophore (DyLight800) binding assay to monitor changes with temperature of a single introduced cysteine using membranes from CFTR\u2010expressing cells. Using this method, we found that second\u2010site mutations in NBD1 and ATP binding increased the peak labeling temperature of 524C. We also found that nanobodies specific to NBD1 altered the temperature\u2010dependent labeling of 524C in cys\u2010less CFTR, corresponding to their effect on the thermal stability of isolated NBD1. Thus rapid screening of constructs was enabled prior to purification. To then follow the thermal unfolding of improved constructs with a biophysical assay (intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence), small amount of proteins were purified and scanned by nano\u2010differential scanning fluorimetry (Nano\u2010DSF) using a Prometheus NT.48 (NanoTemper Technologies). Using this instrument, we were able to determine the melting temperature (Tm) of full\u2010length CFTR and isolated NBD1 with a concentration as low as 0.1 mg/mL protein and 10 \u03bcL sample size. Second\u2010site mutations increased the Tm of full\u2010length CFTR as well as isolated NBD1, as previously determined using other techniques. In addition, nanobodies that bind to and thermally stabilize NBD1 increased the Tm of full\u2010length CFTR.

            "text": "Gene therapy holds promise for cystic fibrosis using approaches including gene addition or gene editing. Gene editing tools such as CRISPR/Cas9 offer the possibility of modifying the CFTR locus, and correction could persist if progenitor cells were modified. DNA double\u2010strand breaks can be introduced using CRISPR/Cas9 to either modify a specific locus by introducing insertions or deletions (indels) from repair by non\u2010homologous end joining (NHEJ) or to enhance homology\u2010directed repair (HDR) and obtain precise gene corrections by homologous recombination. We are investigating both strategies to evaluate repair of representative classes of CFTR mutations. An intron mutation in the CFTR, 3849+10Kb C>T, creates a novel splicing donor site 10 kb into intron 22\u201023. This mutation, therefore, is a candidate for disruption by NHEJ. In contrast, the deletion mutation in the exon 11 of CFTR, F508del, needs a repair template, in addition to CRISPR/Cas9 editing, to make precise replacement of the mutation with the correct wild\u2010type sequence. Here, we utilize single or dual Staphylococcus pyogenes (Sp) Cas9\u2010 and/or Staphylococcus aureus (Sa) Cas9\u2010specific single guide RNAs introduced by non\u2010viral or viral delivery to remove and or replace the deleterious mutation and effect repair by NHEJ or HDR. We screened 8 pairs of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) (targeting indel 22\u201023) and 10 single sgRNAs (targeting exon 11) to identify those that most efficiently introduced double\u2010strand breaks at these 2 regions of the gene. We next tested the efficacy of different delivery vectors by assessing the nature of indels, the indel efficiency, Cas9 expression, vector genome copy numbers, vector persistence and HDR efficiency in cell lines and primary airway epithelial cells. Our results demonstrate that both SpCas9 and SaCas9 genome editing can disrupt mutation and/or induce correction by HDR at different regions of CFTR locus.",

The c.1766+1G\u2192A splice site mutation is one of the 16 most common CFTR mutations worldwide. In the CFTR2 global database, \u02dc0.6% of patients with CF have at least one c.1766+1G\u2192A allele. However, the structural and functional defects of CFTR caused by this splice site mutation at the donor site of intron 13 remains unclear. In addition, the effects of F508del CFTR modulators on this CFTR splice site mutant are still unknown. To characterize c.1766+1G\u2192A CFTR and explore potential therapeutic strategies, we studied heterologous primary hBE cells with the F508del and c.1766+1G\u2192A CFTR mutations (patient code: CFBr002). RT\u2010PCR analysis indicated that this splice site mutation causes CFTR exon13 skipping (87bp), which results in a deletion of 29 amino acids from Arg560 to Ser589 in CFTR. This missing segment is located at NBD1 domain and contains the Walker B motif in the ATP binding site 1. These results are consistent with early reports by Strong, T.V. et al. (Hum Mutat, 1992;1:380\u20107). Moreover, F508del and c.1766+1G\u2192A CFTR genes in this heterozygous donor encoded Met470 and Val470, respectively. Equivalent TECC current studies indicated there were no effects of forskolin and F508del potentiators on these heterozygous primary hBE cells in the absence of F508del\u2010CFTR correctors. Compared to homozygous F508del\u2010CFTR primary hBE (patient code: CFFT028H), combined F508del correctors and potentiators have lower efficacy in CFBr002, suggesting that c.1766+1G\u2192A CFTR has impaired chloride channel function.",

Western blot analyses revealed only a weak Band B in the three c.1766+1G\u2192A stable cell lines compared to WT\u2010CFTR expressing cells, suggesting the splice site mutant causes impaired biogenesis and maturation defects. Common F508del CFTR correctors (C7 (PTC124), C17, C18) and a series of AbbVie compounds (such as AC1, AC2a, AC2b, and AC2c) significantly increased c.1766+1G\u2192A Band B, but did not produce Band C individually. However, a combination of two compounds, such as AC1/AC2c and C18/AC2c, resulted in the production of Band C in CFBEs, suggesting that these compounds work together to promote c.1766+1G\u2192A CFTR maturation. The rescued band C protein could not be activated by forskolin or forskolin plus several different F508del\u2010CFTR potentiators, including VX\u2010770, PG\u201001, and Genistein, implying c.1766+1G\u2192A channel function is also defective. In conclusion, the c.1766+1G\u2192A CFTR splice site mutation results in multiple defects including protein biogenesis, maturation and channel function.",

Particularly valuable are functional cell models that can be propagated but conserve their ability to grow as well\u2010differentiated airway epithelia for personalized chloride transport measurements. Thirteen CF subjects with common and rare CFTR mutations provided airway cell samples from nasal or tracheobronchial tissues. Three CF individuals were genotypically characterized by carrying the common F508del mutation on both alleles (F508del/F508del), four CF individuals had a rare CFTR mutation on the other allele (F508del/3905insT, F508del/1154insTC, F508del/Y563N, F508del/A455E), and six CF individuals had two rare CFTR mutations on both alleles (G551D/Y1092X, G542X/3849+1kb C\u2010>T, V520F/1717\u20101G\u2010>A, G85E/1717\u20101G\u2010>A, G542X/1248+1G\u2010>A, W1282X/W1282X). Primary CF cells were cultured in presence of Y\u201027632 Rho kinase inhibitor and irradiated 3T3 murine fibroblasts to induce a proliferative state (CF\u2010CRC). Cell numbers were expanded through serially passages, seeded (5x105 cells/cm2) onto Snapwell inserts, and grown at an air\u2010liquid interface to induce differentiation. The activation of mutant CFTR Cl\u2010 currents by a small molecule potentiator (VX\u2010770) and corrector (VX\u2010809) was studied by measuring the acute responsiveness to forskolin and VX\u2010770 (1\u03bcM) followed by CFTR inhibitor 172 (50 \u03bcM). CF\u2010CRCs from three CF patients homozygous for F508del responded to VX\u2010770 acutely at passages 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 10 but showed a trend to decline at passage 10. Prior treatment with VX\u2010809 (3 \u03bcM, 12\u201024 h) enhanced F508del\u2010CFTR currents \u02dc2\u2010fold. Responsiveness to VX\u2010770 was detected in CF\u2010CRCs from three patients carrying the F508del mutation on one allele and included F508del/3905insT, F508del/1154insTC and F508del/Y563N, whereas no response was found in one patient who carried the F508del/A455E genotype even after treatment with VX\u2010809. Responsiveness to VX\u2010770 was detected in two CF patients who carried rare CF mutations on both alleles and included the stop mutation Y1092X (G551D/Y1092X) and the splice mutation 3849+10kb C\u2010>T (G542X/3849+10kb C\u2010>T); enhancement by VX\u2010809 was also observed. In contrast, no responsiveness to VX\u2010770 was found for the splice mutation 1717\u20101G\u2010>A in two CF patients carrying V520F/1717\u20101G\u2010>A or G85E/1717\u20101G\u2010>A. Similarly, no responsiveness was found for 1248+1G\u2010>A in a patient with the G542X/1248+1G\u2010>A genotype and a patient homozygous for the stop mutation W1282X. The limited numbers of CF patient\u2010derived cells can be expanded through conditional reprogramming and used to assess efficacy of CFTR\u2010targeted compounds. These data suggest the utility of CRCs for personalized ion transport measurements in Ussing chambers and demonstrate responses to small\u2010molecule potentiators (VX\u2010770) and correctors (VX\u2010809) for a selected number of rare CF genotypes.

The PS1 response (percent increase produced by acute addition of PS1 compared to the forskolin steady state) ranged from 210% (F508del) to 0% (R560T).

The most common defect is a trafficking mutant resulting from a deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (\u0394F508\u2010CFTR). \u0394F508\u2010CFTR is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is unable to be processed for plasma membrane insertion. Efforts to enhance exit of \u0394F508\u2010CFTR from ER and improve its trafficking to the plasma membrane are of utmost importance for the development of treatment strategies. This work addresses the underlying cause of the disease by identifying a novel signaling pathway associated with the \u0394F508\u2010CFTR protein.",

S\u2010nitrosylation signaling is metabolically regulated and it is often disordered in pulmonary diseases including CF. GSNO levels are low in the CF airway, in part because of increased expression of GSNO reductase (Zaman K, et al. Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol. 2016;310:L263\u201070). Co\u2010chaperone C\u2010terminus Hsc70 interacting protein (CHIP), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, helps to target improperly\u2010folded CFTR for degradation (Younger M, et al. J Cell Biol. 2004;167:1075\u201085). CHIP is of particular interest to our research because it co\u2010localizes with CFTR and interacts with the chaperones Hsc70, Hsp70, Hsp90, and co\u2010chaperone Hop. CHIP has eight cysteine residues, and has the potential to act as an S\u2010nitrosylation motif. We have previously shown that an active site cysteine in another E3 ubiquitin ligase, protein von Hippel Lindau, is inhibited by S\u2010nitrosylation (Palmer L, et al. JCI 2007;117:2592\u2010601). Therefore, we hypothesized that CHIP could be modified by GSNO to prevent CFTR degradation. Furthermore, inhibition of the expression and function of CHIP, Hsc70, Hsp90 and Hop by S\u2010nitrosothiols could not only improve CFTR expression and maturation, but also may affect its cell surface stability (Oklyoneda T, et al. Science. 2010;329:805\u201010). Here, we found that CHIP is expressed in CFBE41o\u2010 cells expressing both F508del and wild\u2010type CFTR. Our study showed that 10 \u03bcM GSNO significantly decreases CHIP expression after 4 hours (4.0\u2010fold, and 3.6\u2010fold respectively, p<0.002). To characterize further the interaction of CHIP with CFTR, we knocked down endogenous CHIP with 50 nM of CHIP siRNA duplexes. 48 h after transfection, the level of CHIP was decreased (3.5\u2010fold, p<0.002), and this produced an increase in levels of immature and mature forms of F508del CFTR (1.5\u2010fold and 1.8\u2010fold). However, in the presence of GSNO, the increase of F508del CFTR maturation was more significant (1.8\u2010fold and 2.8\u2010fold, p<0.005). In addition, we demonstrated that GSNO S\u2010nitrosylated CHIP in a concentration\u2010dependent manner. To confirm that F508del CFTR is expressed on this cell surface following knockdown with siRNA CHIP, we performed cell\u2010surface labeling. After CHIP knockdown, levels of full F508del CFTR maturation on the cell surface increased (2.1\u2010fold, p<0.002). However, the presence of GSNO ensured that the increase of CFTR maturation was more pronounced (3.4\u2010fold, p<0.005). Of note, the proteosome inhibitor MG132 prevented depletion of cellular CHIP levels after GSNO treatment (2.4\u2010fold, p<0.005), and GSNO\u2010treated cells have less\u2010ubiquitinated CFTR (3.4\u2010fold, p<0.001) than GSNO\u2010untreated cells, suggesting that S\u2010nitrosylation of CHIP inhibits CFTR ubiquitination by targeting CHIP for degradation and/or inhibiting CHIP function. We believe our observations will offer a novel approach in identifying the key mechanism by which S\u2010nitrosothiols S\u2010nitrosylate CHIP so as to increase CFTR maturation and prolong F508del CFTR cell\u2010surface expression.

Exactly how this coupling occurs remains debated, but previous reports of a charge\u2010neutralization mutation in CFTR's 6th transmembrane segment (R352C or Q in TM6) enable direct visualization of ATP hydrolysis\u2010driven gating transitions due to the existence of two distinct open\u2010channel conductance levels (smaller O1 and larger O2), and a preferred pattern of C\u2010\u2010>O1\u2010\u2010>O2\u2010\u2010>C transition over C\u2010\u2010>O2\u2010\u2010>O1\u2010\u2010>C, which indicates a violation of microscopic reversibility and hence demands an input of free energy likely from ATP hydrolysis. While cysteine scanning CFTR's 5th TM (TM5) with negatively charged 2\u2010sulfonatoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSES\u2010), we also found two open\u2010channel conductance levels for N306C/Cysless\u2010CFTR after MTSES\u2010 modification with the same preferred gating topological pattern of C \u2010\u2010> O1 \u2010\u2010> O2 \u2010\u2010> C. Similar phenotypes were observed with N306D\u2010 or N306E\u2010CFTR, suggesting that introducing a negative charge at this very position confers this unique behavior. Whereas R352Q/C and N306D/E are mutations with a net subtraction of a positive charge in the internal vestibule of CFTR's pore, even with the net charge unaltered, by altering the position of endogenous positively charged side chains at R303 and R352 along TM5 and TM6 respectively, we could observe similar O1\u2010O2 states and asymmetrical gating transitions, indicating that the position of the charge in the inner vestibule also affects sub\u2010conductance. To further understand the structural/biochemical mechanism underpinning this hydrolysis\u2010driven O1 to O2 transition, we examined the effects of channel\u2010permeant blocker SCN\u2010 and channel\u2010impermeant blocker MOPS\u2010 on O1 and O2 states. While these two states show indistinguishable sensitivity to SCN\u2010 block, MOPS\u2010 blocks the O1 state more than it does to the O2 states when the net charge of the inner vestibule is unchanged or increased. Unexpectedly however, when the net charge in the internal vestibule of CFTR's pore is decreased, this differential sensitivity to MOPS\u2010 block no longer exists. A two\u2010step blocking mechanism is proposed to explain the differential responses of pre\u2010hydrolytic and post\u2010hydrolytic open states to MOPS\u2010 blocking: MOPS\u2010 first docks to the inner vestibule of pore before it sojourns deeper into the pore. Furthermore, we propose, based on what we know about the gating conformational changes in CFTR, that the internal vestibule is expanded during O1 to O2 transition so that the mutation\u2010induced charge perturbations cause a diminished electrostatic attraction or repulsion to the MOPS\u2010 from the internal vestibule in the O2 state. This expansion of the internal vestibule during ATP hydrolysis also explains why the single\u2010channel conductance of the O2 state is higher than that of the O1 state. Collectively, the current study not only affirms and perhaps generalizes the O1\u2010O2 phenotype, but also provides a large toolbox for future mechanistic studies of CFTR gating by ATP hydrolysis.",

            "text": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by loss of CFTR expression due to gene mutations that decrease protein synthesis, stability, trafficking, chloride conduction, and/or altered channel gating. The efficiency of NBD1 folding is a limiting factor in CFTR trafficking and a major cause of misfolding by disease mutations. The most common mutation worldwide is \u0394F508, which decreases NBD1 folding efficiency (in cells), and thermodynamic stability (in vitro). If F508del NBD1 is able to fold, however, it traffics to the plasma membrane and partially restores chloride transport. Unfortunately, there are few small molecules that specifically target NBD1. Lumacaftor, which partially restores CFTR folding and trafficking, must be present during synthesis for maximal effect, suggesting that it acts by facilitating proper folding of one or more transient biosynthetic intermediates. Understanding and manipulating the cotranslational NBD1 folding pathways therefore provides a potential approach for CFTR correction. To address these challenges, we isolated ribosome nascent chain complexes (RNCs) and measured FRET between donor and acceptor fluorophores that were incorporated into NBD1 during its synthesis to define the NBD1 cotranslational folding pathway (Khushoo A, et al. Mol Cell. 2011;41:682\u201092 and Kim SJ, et al. Science. 2015;348:444\u20108). These studies revealed a highly orchestrated sequential folding pathway that depends on biosynthetic machinery, translation rate, and primary sequence. To overcome low concentrations of RNCs obtained from in vitro translation systems (1\u20105 nM), RNCs were immobilized on Nickel\u2010NTA/IDA beads to increase the effective local concentration and enable quantitative fluorescence measurements via high\u2010content microscopic imaging. This system allowed rapid assessment of nascent polypeptide folding and was scalable for high\u2010throughput screening in 384\u2010well format. Bead imaging provided exceptional sensitivity that allowed detection of attomol quantities of protein (6 x 105 molecules/bead), and high degree of reproducibility (Z' score of 0.6\u20100.8). Quantitative imaging of immobilized RNCs allowed interrogation of (i) length\u2010dependent structural changes of cotranslational folding intermediates at virtually any stage of synthesis, (ii) nascent protein folding in ribosome attached and released states, (iii) structural effects of disease\u2010associated mutations, and (iv) correction of these defects by complementary genetic manipulation. Moreover, RNCs isolated from cell\u2010free translation reactions are stable at room temperature and amenable to cryopreservation, enabling scaling efforts needed for screening consistency. These results therefore provide a novel platform to identify small molecules that interact with de novo folding intermediates as well as full\u2010length protein, while avoiding problems associated with large\u2010scale purification of unstable or low\u2010yield substrates.

Increasing evidence suggests that CFTR dysfunction is also a significant contributor to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). CFTR potentiators increase CFTR activity and might be a potential therapeutic strategy for COPD patients in addition to CF patients. It was reported that the approved CFTR potentiator, ivacaftor, reduces F508del\u2010CFTR cellular stability and has multiple off\u2010target functions necessitating the discovery of novel potentiators. We recently found that IOWH\u2010032, OSSK\u20102, and OSSK\u20103 function as blockers and potentiators of human CFTR (hCFTR). Here, we report the identification of nearly 80 candidates from the ZINC database discovered using pharmacophore modeling analysis by removing the pore\u2010blocking moiety of IOWH\u2010032, OSSK\u20102, and OSSK\u20103. Moreover, we screened the candidate compounds with two electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) and found multiple compounds that potentiated without detectable block of WT\u2010hCFTR expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The most potent compounds were further tested with inside\u2010out macropatch recordings. The compounds potentiated WT\u2010hCFTR from the intracellular side when the channels were activated with low concentration of protein kinase A (PKA, 6.4 U/mL) in the presence of 1 mM MgATP. The compounds also potentiated F508del\u2010CFTR under similar experimental conditions. Further studies will test the effects of the above compounds on hCFTR expressed in human airway epithelia in Ussing chambers. In future work, we will reiterate the pharmacophore analysis with the updated pharmacophore model to identify more high efficiency potentiators. (CFF MCCART14G0; NIH R01\u2010DK\u2010056481.)",

Our published data demonstrate that TGF\u2010\u03b21 represses CFTR mRNA and prevents corrector\u2010mediated rescue of the \u0394F508\u2010CFTR. Repression of \u0394F508\u2010CFTR may explain, in part, the limited efficacy of corrector and potentiator (VX\u2010809/VX\u2010770) in recent clinical trials. Studies were conducted to elucidate TGF\u2010\u03b21 effectors responsible for CFTR repression in order to develop strategies to precisely eliminate the pathogenic activity. TGF\u2010\u03b21 controls expression of several microRNAs (miRNAs), including miRNA\u2010145 that inhibits CFTR post\u2010transcriptionally, acting on the miR\u2010145 target sites in CFTR. Studies in \u0394F508\u2010homozygous primary differentiated human bronchial epithelial (CF\u2010HBE) cells were conducted to examine whether TGF\u2010\u03b21 upregulates miRNA\u2010145. First, we examined expression of miRNA\u2010145 in CF\u2010HBE cells after TGF\u2010\u03b21 treatment by qRT\u2010PCR. TGF\u2010\u03b21 significantly increased miR\u2010145 expression as a function of time (n=3 in triplicates in different CF\u2010HBE cells; P<0.05). We observed a reciprocal decrease in CFTR mRNA (n=3 from different tissues in triplicates; P<0.05). Expression of miR\u2010145 was completely blocked by TGF\u2010\u03b21 inhibitor, SB431542. Published studies demonstrate that miRNA\u2010145 levels are increased in CF\u2010HBE cells, compared to non\u2010diseased controls while TGF\u2010\n\u03b2\n1 gene polymorphisms are associated with high TGF\u2010\u03b21 levels. We hypothesized that if miRNA\u2010145 expression in CF\u2010HBE cells is regulated by TGF\u2010\u03b21, the miRNA\u2010145 levels should differ between CF patients. Thus, we examined expression of miRNA\u2010145 in CF bronchial tissues obtained at lung transplantation under an IRB\u2010approved protocol, by in situ hybridization and compared to tissues with no known disease (negative control) or emphysema (positive control). A blinded reviewer assigned the score between 0 and 3 based on the miRNA\u2010145 expression in the bronchial epithelium. The expression of miRNA\u2010145 was 0 in negative controls, compared to +3 in the positive controls, and was variable at +1, +2, or +3 in the CF samples (n=3 in triplicates in each group). On\u2010going studies examine miRNA\u2010145 expression in CF bronchial epithelium, TGF\u2010\u03b21 levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and TGF\u2010\n\u03b2\n1 gene polymorphisms. Next, we examined whether miRNA\u2010145 inhibitors attenuate TGF\u2010\u03b21 repression of CFTR. Differentiated CF\u2010HBE monolayers were treated with TGF\u2010\u03b21 and either the locked nucleic acid (LNATM)\u2010conjugated miRNA\u2010145 inhibitor control (Exiqon Inc.; miRNA\u2010145\u2010inh\u2010CTRL) or miRNA\u2010145 inhibitor (miRNA\u2010145\u2010inh). miRNA\u2010145\u2010inh blocked TGF\u2010\u03b21\u2010stimulated miRNA\u2010145 expression, compared to miRNA\u2010145\u2010inh\u2010CTRL and partially attenuated the TGF\u2010\u03b21 repression of CFTR. Next, we demonstrated that the LNATM\u2010conjugated miRNA\u2010145 mimic reduced CFTR mRNA in non\u2010diseased HBE monolayers in the absence of TGF\u2010\u03b21 stimulation. Taken together our data provide strong evidence that miRNA\u2010145 is a TGF\u2010\u03b21 effector repressing CFTR in CF bronchial epithelium. Strategies to block CFTR repression by miRNA\u2010145 may promote efficacy of correctors to restore the \u0394F508\u2010CFTR function in CF patients.",

            "text": "Resveratrol is a polyphenol in red grape skin with potential cardioprotective, anti\u2010aging, and antidiabetogenic properties. It is widely consumed as a nutritional supplement and its effects on CFTR function have been studied with hopes to augment the CFTR Cl\u2010 channel function. The results have been conflicting, likely because of cell\u2010type specific and context\u2010dependent effects of resveratrol. Thus, we examined the effects of resveratrol exclusively in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells, including primary differentiated HBE cells from non\u2010CF lungs, HBE cells from F508del homozygous lungs (CF\u2010HBE), and CFBE41o\u2010 cell line expressing wild\u2010type CFTR. Primary HBE cells were treated with resveratrol or vehicle control (CTRL) for 24h. At lower concentrations (5\u201025 \u03bcM), resveratrol did not affect the forskolin\u2010stimulated, CFTR\u2010inh172\u2010sensitive short circuit currents (Isc). However, at higher concentrations (50\u2010100 \u03bcM), resveratorol inhibited the forskolin\u2010stimulated Isc (p<0.01, N=12 from 4 different donors). Resveratrol also inhibited VX\u2010809\u2010rescued Isc in CF\u2010HBE cells (p<0.05, N=9 from 3 different donors). As control, resveratrol did not affect the amiloride\u2010sensitive Isc, irrespective of concentration. At high concentration, resveratrol inhibited CFTR protein abundance (58\u00b14% vs. CTRL at 4h and 32\u00b15% vs. CTRL at 24h; N=3 per group from 3 different donors); however, it had no effect on CFTR mRNA levels. To determine effects of resveratrol on CFTR protein stability we inhibited new protein synthesis with cyclohexamide. Resveratrol did not alter CFTR protein stability, indicating that it does not stimulate CFTR protein degradation. Taken together the data indicate that resveratrol inhibits CFTR Cl\u2010 channel function by interfering with CFTR post\u2010transcriptionally, in the biosynthetic pathway. Resveratrol works via several context\u2010dependent mechanisms, including activation of class III histone deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). The deacetylation reaction catalyzed by SIRT1 is coupled to the cleavage of a cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). SIRT1 activity is critically dependent on the availability of cellular NAD+. Resveratrol increased NAD+ generation indicating activation of SIRT1. The specific SIRT1 inhibitor, EX\u2010527, or the dominant negative (DN)\u2010SIRT1 partially rescued resveratrol inhibition of CFTR protein levels in CFBE41o\u2010 cells. SIRT1 exerts its metabolic effects via inhibition of a potent inducer of protein synthesis, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Blocking mTOR activity with rapamycin decreased CFTR protein levels, similar to resveratrol, suggesting that mTOR plays a role in the resveratrol\u2010and SIRT1\u2010mediated inhibition of CFTR. Current studies focus on confirming the role of mTOR in CFTR biosynthesis. Taken together our studies demonstrate a novel CFTR biosynthetic pathway and determine that the common nutritional supplement resveratrol may compromise the corrector\u2010mediated rescue of mutant CFTR.",

Existing small molecule F508del\u2010CFTR correctors modestly improve maturation of the mutant protein, though they have no effect on CFTR ubiquitination as measured in vitro. Therefore, we hypothesized that combining CFTR correctors with inhibitors of protein ubiquitination would increase the pool of F508del\u2010CFTR protein available for correction, leading to synergistic improvements in F508del\u2010CFTR trafficking and function. As a proof\u2010of\u2010principle, we discovered that the pyrazone compound PYR\u201041, which inhibits the ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1), decreased F508del\u2010CFTR ubiquitination, and led to a small but significant increase in band C and in chloride currents when added in combination with VX\u2010809 compared to treatment with VX\u2010809 alone. Through targeted screening of structural analogs of PYR\u201041 and other known inhibitors of the ubiquitination machinery, we identified additional compounds that decrease the ubiquitination of CFTR as well as select model substrates. The majority of compounds fall into two classes: inhibitors of the ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1), and inhibitors of ubiquitin ligases (E3s) such as CHIP. When combined with VX\u2010809, some of these newly identified inhibitors promote increased F508del\u2010CFTR trafficking and protein function beyond what we observed when we combined VX\u2010809 and PYR\u201041. We are continuing to screen potential inhibitors in an effort that is guided by the evolving structure\u2010activity relationships and assisted by structural modeling of the E1 and E3 enzymes with existing inhibitors.

            "text": "ERp29 is a 29 kDa thioredoxin\u2010homologous protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that displays chaperone\u2010like properties. Interestingly, ERp29 has only a single cysteine instead of the usual C\u2010X\u2010X\u2010C thioredoxin motif. In addition to displaying chaperone\u2010like properties at both the biophysical and cellular levels, ERp29 also has demonstrated roles in cortical neuron protection, suppressing tumorigenesis and regulating connexin 43 hemichannel biogenesis and assembly. We have previously demonstrated that ERp29 promotes CFTR biogenesis (Suaud et al. J Biol Chem. 2011;286:21239\u201053), and, as the biogenesis of CFTR and ENaC share a number of features, we subsequently demonstrated that ERp29 also regulates ENaC biogenesis and functional expression (Grumbach Y, et al. Am J Physiol Cell Physiol. 2014;307:C701\u20109). In particular, these studies demonstrated that overexpression of wt ERp29 increased ENaC functional expression, most likely due to increased cleavage of cell surface ENaC, whereas overexpression of a mutant ERp29 lacking its single cysteine (C157S ERp29) decreased ENaC functional expression due to decreased ENaC cleavage at the surface. ERp29 overexpression also promoted the interaction of both ENaC and CFTR with the coat complex II (COP II) ER exit machinery, whereas C157S ERp29 overexpression decreased this interaction. These data suggested a model where ERp29 may promote ENaC cleavage during biogenesis by directing ENaC to the Golgi where it would be subject to cleavage by furin. We thus further hypothesized that ERp29's subcellular localization would be a key determinant of its regulation of ENaC and CFTR biogenesis. ERp29's C\u2010terminal ER retention motif is KEEL, a KDEL variant that is associated with less robust ER retention. To assess if ERp29's retention at or its release from the ER are critical for its regulation of ENaC and CFTR biogenesis, we designed mutant ERp29s containing either a KDEL retention motif (ERp29 KDEL) that should be better returned to the ER from the proximal Golgi by the KDEL receptor, or a mutant where the retention motif was deleted (ERp29 \u0394KEEL) that would interact less well with the KDEL receptor, and therefore potentially better escape the ER. Interestingly, ENaC functional expression was decreased by ERp29 \u0394KEEL overexpression, while ERp29 KDEL did not elicit any significant effect. As already observed with wt and C157S ERp29 overexpression, \u03b2\u2010ENaC expression at the apical surface was not changed with overexpression of ERp29 KDEL or \u0394KEEL. In contrast, both ERp29 KDEL and \u0394KEEL overexpression decreased CFTR functional expression. That ERp29 \u0394KEEL inhibited both ENaC and CFTR functional expression suggested a role for the KDEL receptor in ENaC and CFTR biogenesis. In support of this hypothesis, our preliminary data suggest that siRNA\u2010mediated depletion of Sec24D decreases the processing and cleavage of ENaC in the Golgi during biogenesis, as well as CFTR functional expression. Together our findings suggest a key regulatory role for ERp29's association with the KDEL receptor in the biogenesis of ENaC and CFTR.",

Recently developed approaches including irradiated fibroblast feeder layers and inclusion of rho\u2010associated protein kinase inhibitor enable >6 passages (105\u2010 to 106\u2010fold expansion of cell number) with good retention of epithelial function. The \u201cgold standard\u201d for in vitro testing of CFTR correctors and potentiators is well\u2010differentiated primary human bronchial epithelial cells obtained from lungs transplanted from CF patients. The number of different patient samples obtained in this manner is small and the range of CFTR mutations available for study is limited. The goal of this work is to establish methods for collection, culture, and expansion of primary human nasal epithelial cells, derived from non\u2010CF volunteers to examine intersubject variation in CFTR expression and function. Nasal brushings were obtained from 16 healthy, non\u2010CF volunteers. Nasal cells were collected a second time (>2 months later) from 4 of the subjects. All twenty samples were expanded (to passage 2) and cryopreserved. For analysis of CFTR function and expression, cells from multiple passages were seeded onto filter supports for establishment of air/liquid interface culture. The epithelial monolayers were transferred to Ussing chambers 15\u201060 days after seeding, bathed with symmetrical Krebs bicarbonate ringers solution, and maintained under short\u2010circuit conditions. Amiloride, forskolin, and inh172 were added sequentially to inhibit sodium absorption, stimulate CFTR\u2010dependent Cl\u2010 secretion, and to inhibit CFTR\u2010dependent Cl\u2010 secretion, respectively. Viable epithelial cell cultures were established from all 20 subject samples. All of the cultures seeded onto filter supports for air/liquid interface culture developed high transepithelial resistance and the mean amiloride\u2010sensitive sodium current for 16 subjects was 83.1 \u00b1 14.0 \u03bcA/cm2 with a range of 3 \u2013 159 \u03bcA/cm2. Forskokin\u2010stimulated and inh172\u2010inhibited current was readily observed in all non\u2010CF monolayers. The mean Cl\u2010 secretory response (I172\u2010sensitive current) for individual subjects was 12.1 \u00b1 4 \u03bcA/cm2 with a range of 5.7 \u2013 26.0 \u03bcA/cm2. The ion transport properties of cells obtained from multiple brushings of a subject were qualitatively and quantitatively similar. CFTR mRNA expression across 16 subjects varied by \u02dc10\u2010fold and was correlated to CFTR Cl\u2010 current. Epithelial cells obtained by nasal brushing of non\u2010CF volunteers are readily isolated, cultured, expanded, and cryopreserved. The isolated nasal epithelial cells can be expanded rapidly to produce >1 billion cells (>2,000 filters) within 3\u20104 weeks. We have previously shown that primary cultures of CF patient\u2010derived nasal epithelial cells are a sensitive system for testing CFTR function and for evaluating small molecule CFTR\u2010directed therapeutics. The current data identify a target level for CFTR function in non\u2010CF subjects and demonstrate a wide range of normal CFTR expression and function that might also contribute to individual patient drug response variation among CF subjects.

For this purpose we have already generated a CFTR construct with stabilized NBDs and demonstrated that it remains functional for two weeks after purification and reconstitution. (1) With NBDs stabilized the MSDs may remain the most dynamic part of the protein after detergent disruptions of the lipid bilayer. Here we present further improvement of protein stability in a correctly folded state by spontaneous S\u2010S bond formation between engineered Cysteines near the external ends of TM6 and TM12. Formation of this S\u2010S bond between L333C and G1127C occurs only in the correctly folded protein and reversibly restricts the set of MSDs structural configurations to the ion pore closed states. Maintenance of correct MSD assembly in the purified protein after storage at 4oC was evaluated by determining the degree of disulfide bond reformation after removal of the reducing agent (DTT) used to broken it. A much shorter life time was observed on the storage of the purified protein in the conditions with disulfide bond disrupted. The state of NBDs during these manipulations was monitored by ATP binding. Limited proteolysis also was used to apprise the overall assembly of the purified protein under these distinct conditions. This CFTR construct with stabilized NBDs and MSDs was able to maintain its folded state in the solubilized form for a month after purification.",

            "text": "The human cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are a family of enzymes encoded by 11 gene families (PDE1\u2010PDE11), most of which contain several genes (eg, PDE4A, 4B, 4C, and 4D), each with multiple splice variants. They degrade cyclic nucleotides and it has been shown that inhibiting certain PDEs can elevate intracellular cAMP levels ([cAMP]i) and stimulate CFTR\u2010dependent anion secretion by human airway epithelia, suggesting PDE inhibitors as a potential treatment option for cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Previous studies have focussed on the roles of PDE3, 4 and 5 in regulating CFTR activity and little is known regarding the importance of other PDE isoforms. Recently, we demonstrated that primary human bronchial epithelia (pHBE) express PDE8A mRNA at levels which are similar to those of PDE4D mRNA. We therefore examined whether PDE8 is involved in cAMP\u2010dependent stimulation of CFTR by using a recently\u2010described PDE8\u2010selective inhibitor, PF\u20104957325 (PF, Pfizer). CFBE cells overexpressing wild type CFTR (CFBEwt) and pHBE cells from healthy subjects (pHBE WT) were grown as polarized monolayers and allowed to differentiate at the air\u2010liquid interface (ALI) prior to study. Although adding the PDE8 inhibitor alone did not elevate [cAMP]i as measured using ELISA, a significant effect of the PDE8 inhibitor on [cAMP]i was observed during PDE4 inhibition and submaximal forskolin stimulation, indicating that PDE8 does contribute to cAMP metabolism in pHBE WT and CFBEwt cells. Furthermore, measurements of short\u2010circuit current (Isc) in CFBEwt cells mounted in Ussing chambers revealed that PDE8 inhibition increased CFTR\u2010dependent Isc by 2.52 \u00b1 0.21 \u03bcA cm\u20102 (p<0.01 vs DMSO; n=7), which is a small response compared to those produced by the PDE4 inhibitor rolipram (36.77 \u00b1 6.58 \u03bcA cm\u20102; n=4) or dual PDE3/4 inhibitor RPL554 (49.82 \u00b1 7.82 \u03bcA cm\u20102; n=4). Nevertheless, PF increased Isc by 1.71 \u00b1 0.42 \u03bcA cm\u20102 (p<0.01 vs DMSO; n=18) in pHBE WT cells, which was comparable to the stimulations by rolipram (4.16 \u00b1 2.51 \u03bcA cm\u20102; n=3), and RPL554 (3.37 \u00b1 0.40 \u03bcA cm\u20102; n=7) in primary cells, and greater than those observed using the PDE3 inhibitor milrinone or PDE5 inhibitor sildenafil. Moreover, PDE8 inhibition enhanced the Isc response to rolipram and RPL554 by \u02dc3 fold and PDE4 inhibition increased the response to PF by \u02dc6 fold, indicating that PDE4 and PDE8 inhibitors act synergistically on CFTR\u2010dependent secretion. Finally, we assessed the effect of inhibiting PDE8 in pHBE cells from CF patients with the R117H/F508del genotype. The PDE8 inhibitor did not stimulate Isc when added alone, however it enhanced Isc when these CF primary cells were pretreated with a submaximal concentration of forskolin. In summary, our data suggest PDE8 as a novel regulator of CFTR in wild\u2010type and CF human airway epithelia. It has a more prominent role than PDE3 and PDE5 and inhibitors of PDE8 and PDE4 act synergistically, thus PDE8 may represent a novel therapeutic target in CF.",

Using the available CF/CFTR and human ABC\u2010transporter mutation databases, we have identified and profiled a series of variants in the cytosolic domains of CFTR for their effects on CFTR protein folding and structure.

This scoring system ranks mutations based on the conservation of native ABC\u2010transporter sequences and their reported variants to provide additional confidence in the identification of rare disease\u2010associated alleles. Optimization of this method prioritizes > 80% of CF\u2010causing CFTR2 alleles with highest confidence. Applying this computional strategy to the CFTR1 mutation database, we have identified roughly 60 missense mutations of interest in NBD1 and 35 in NBD2 for subsequent studies. This expands the CFTR2 NBD mutation sets by roughly 5\u2010fold and allows for a more comprehensive mutation\u2010driven analysis of NBD folding and structure and CFTR biogenesis. Using these datasets, we have generated mutation libraries to systematically study the folding and stability of the NBDs in vitro, the effects of mutations on their structure, and the folding and trafficking of full\u2010length CFTR in cell culture. Using a combination of purified NBD protein and novel in\u2010cell assays, we have assessed the stability of the wildtype and mutant NBD proteins and the effects of mutation on the folding and structure of the NBDs in isolation. In parallel, cell culture studies evaluated the effects of these mutations on full\u2010length CFTR folding and trafficking. Mutations within both NBD1 and NBD2 provide comprehensive support for the hierarchical folding and assembly of CFTR domains; mutations may influence either or both the folding and structure of the NBDs locally or their assembly within the global quaternary complex of CFTR. Correction of these defects, either by known and novel second\u2010site suppressors and small molecules, further stratifies these datasets. Using these data, we have developed computational approaches to further explore the relationships between mutations and their effects on CFTR structure and function using clustering and network analyses. These studies provide additional insight into the biosynthetic pathway of wild\u2010type CFTR and inform our understanding of the molecular pathologies of a large number of rare CF mutations.",

            "text": "CFTR class I and II mutations comprise a cohort of disease\u2010associated alleles that have proven difficult to address by current therapeutic strategies. We previously described a novel approach (genome\u2010wide yeast phenomics) to identify modifiers that rescue class II abnormalities, and high\u2010throughput analysis revealed ribosomal protein L12 (Rpl12) as a primary target for this purpose. Rpl12 binds the 28S rRNA to form the P stalk base in the 60S subunit GTPase\u2010associated center. The stalk interacts with many eukaryotic elongation factors (eEFs) during translation, including Rpl12 with eEF2. Our findings demonstrate siRNA\u2010mediated knockdown of Rpl12 partially corrects functional expression of F508del CFTR and is additive or synergistic with VX\u2010809 (lumacaftorTM) in multiple cell models, including primary HBE codes homozygous for F508del. We next investigated mechanism(s) that underlie CFTR rescue in this setting by testing F508del second\u2010site suppressors. In studies of HRP\u2010tagged F508del CFTR stably expressed in Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) cells, Rpl12 inhibition displayed no additivity with R555K, a mutation that improves stability of nucleotide binding domain 1 (NBD1). In contrast, R1070W, which restores the NBD1\u2010intracellular loop 4 interface, conferred significant increase in plasma membrane\u2010localized F508del following Rpl12 knockdown, a finding which suggests NBD1 stabilization. Inside\u2010out patch clamp analyses were utilized to investigate the folding integrity of rescued F508del protein, and preliminary results show that Rpl12 inhibition produces a thermostable F508del channel, compatible with pro\u2010folding effects on mutant CFTR. Based on these observations, we tested whether additional class II defects might also be rescued, including G85E, A455E and N1303K. Rpl12 knockdown resulted in 2\u20103 fold increase of mature, fully\u2010glycosylated CFTR (C\u2010band) and improved vectoral ion transport for all three CFTR mutants, as quantified by Western analysis and short circuit current, respectively. We have suggested previously that Rpl12 suppression inhibits interaction with eEF2 to slow translation, allowing the ribosome and auxiliary proteins to achieve a more native CFTR conformation. Because other P stalk components known to assemble onto Rpl12 interact with eEF1a, the factor responsible for enzymatic delivery of aminoacylated tRNAs to the ribosome, we investigated whether Rpl12 knockdown might induce incorporation of noncognate amino acids. We show Rpl12 inhibition of G542X\u2010 and W1282X\u2010CFTR promotes increases in full\u2010length protein expression. Taken together, this work provides the first evidence that Rpl12 represents a novel therapeutic strategy for rescue of numerous CFTR class I and II defects. Refinement of the approach will establish the importance of ribosomal proteins during CFTR folding, and furnish new molecular targets for experimental treatment of the disease.

The complexities of CFTR biogenesis, trafficking, and peripheral behavior make it challenging to understand it well enough to correct CFTR mutants and devise a generalized therapy. CF\u2010causing CFTR mutations are broadly categorized into five classes depending upon the spectra of causes that affect synthesis and/or function and may generate variable degree of phenotypic severity. There is significant symptomatic heterogeneity among CF individuals that can only be addressed via designing a therapy specifically for an individual, or personalized medicine. In this study, we attempt to develop personalized\u2010medicine therapies for CF patients by generating patient\u2010derived intestinal organoids and utilize them to study the effect of CFTR modifiers (potentiators and correctors) on mutant CFTR function. We studied different classes of CFTR mutations for their response to CFTR modifiers (specifically CF corrector VX\u2010809 and CF potentiator VX\u2010770) measured as CFTR\u2010directed fluid secretion (forskolin stimulated) in patient\u2010derived intestinal spheres. We obtained interesting outcomes as summarized in the Table which are instrumental to suggesting the right therapy for a patient with a particular type of mutation and more importantly atypical and compound mutations which are not fully characterized to be responsive to FDA\u2010approved CFTR modifiers or the combination. In certain cases, intestinal fluid secretion assay helped to predict additional mutations in the CFTR gene.",

Controlling the density of CFTR on cell surface is a crucial factor to confer its physiologic functions. Restoration of a biosynthetic processing mutant in which the F508 residue is missing (F508delCFTR) on the surface suffers from the instability and leads to ubiquitin\u2010dependent lysosomal degradation. Here we show that intermediate filament protein, keratin 19 (K19), stabilizes wild\u2010type (wt) CFTR and pharmacologically rescued F508delCFTR on cell surface. We found K19 prolongs the half\u2010life of wt\u2010CFTR on the surface by inhibiting the interaction of CFTR with a small GTPase Rab7 and subsequently by impeding CFTR lysosomal degradation. Importantly, downregulation of K19 expression is observed in the airway epithelia derived from F508del/F508del homozygous cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and upregulation of K19 expression potentiates CF corrector (VX\u2010809)\u2010mediated CFTR Cl\u2010 secretion in the airway epithelial cells from CF patients. The ability of CK19 to stabilize the rescued F508delCFTR on cell surface and to enhance the functional effect of VX\u2010809 on the mutant protein provides a novel therapeutic approach to treat CF patients.",

It has been proposed that these lectins ensure the retrotranslocation to the cytosol of misfolded glycoproteins released from ER \u03b11,2\u2010mannosidase (ERManI) for the proteasomal degradation (Mast SW, and Moremen KW. Methods Enzymol. 2006;415:31\u201046).

Moreover, using a duolink assay, we observed that the 3 lectins interact with F508del\u2010CFTR. Next, we transfected cells with EDEM1, EDEM2 or EDEM3 specific siRNA and observed that the decrease of their expression was correlated to a decrease of their interaction with F508del\u2010CFTR. Interestingly, we showed using iodide efflux technique a restoration of a CFTR activity in cells transfected with EDEM1 or EDEM2 siRNA but not in EDEM3 siRNA transfected cells. From these results, we investigated the effect of inhibitors of ERManI on EDEMs/F508del\u2010CFTR interaction and on F508del\u2010CFTR activity and revealed a corrector effect of kifunensine, swainsonine, deoxymannojirimycin (DMJ) and its N\u2010butyl analogue N\u2010BU DMJ. Therefore, we adapted a \u201cclick chemistry\u201d methodology to synthesize more efficient F508del\u2010CFTR correctors based on DMJ clusters. From screening, we observed that the trivalent\u2010DMJ presented the best efficiency with an EC50 of 0.8 \u03bcM. Next, we demonstrated that the trivalent\u2010DMJ decreases by 30% the interaction of F508del\u2010CFTR/EDEM1 or EDEM2 and by 14% with EDEM3. No effect was observed on the interaction with calnexin, HSP70 or HSP90, suggesting an EDEM\u2010dependent mechanism of action. In parallel of these results, we confirmed the corrector effect of our corrector on human polarized bronchial epithelial cells (CFBE) using the Ussing chamber technique with a restoration of an Isc current of 20 \u03bcA/cm2.

Instead, F508del CFTR protein is exclusively retained in the ER and degraded by the ubiquitin\u2010proteasome system, a process refered to as ER\u2010associated protein degradation (ERAD). However, F508del CFTR mobilized to the plasma membrane retains substantial CFTR Cl\u2010 channel function; therefore, understanding of molecular mechanisms that regulate F508del CFTR degradation during its early biogenesis is a critical step to achieve effective and selective mobilization of the mutant CFTR from the ER.",

Here we report that VCP\u2010interacting membrane protein (VIMP) is an ERAD component playing an important role in degrading the misfolded CFTR. Over\u2010expression of VIMP reduced the steady\u2010state levels of WT and F508del CFTR by 70% and 95%, respectively. In cycloheximide chase experiments, VIMP expression resulted in a shorter half life of F508del CFTR from 40 min to 20 min. Conversely, silencing of endogenous VIMP increased F508del CFTR expression by more than 5\u2010fold in human airway epithelial cells. Co\u2010immunoprecipitation and immunostaining revealed that VIMP interacts with F508del CFTR and co\u2010localizes with the mutant protein in the ER region of airway epithelial cells. Since Derlin\u20101 has been reported as a key regulator of CFTR degradation, we asked whether VIMP plays any role in Derlin\u20101 mediated CFTR degradation. Double silence experiment was performed. Compared with silence of Derlin\u20101 only, the double silence of Derlin\u20101 and VIMP did not lead to further increase in F508del CFTR expression, suggesting that VIMP and Derlin\u20101 utilize the same pathway for the CFTR degradation. It has been shown that ubiquitin E3 ligases, RNF5 and CHIP, degrade F508delCFTR. To investigate if VIMP is associated with a specific ubiquitin E3 ligase we performed co\u2010immunoprecipitation and found VIMP interacts with RNF5, but not CHIP in CFBE\u201041o\u2010\u0394F cells. Overexpression of both VIMP and RNF5 virtually eliminated F508del CFTR expression and VIMP\u2010mediated mutant CFTR degradation was abolished by RNF5 dominate negative, indicating VIMP recruits RNF5 to degrade the mutant protein. In CFBE\u201041o\u2010\u0394F cells, silencing VIMP expression increased VX\u2010809\u2010mediated F508delCFTR maturation and its function. Taken together, our data demonstrate that VIMP recruits RNF5 to degrade misfolded F508del CFTR. Downregulation of VIMP enhancing the ability of VX\u2010809 to rescue F508delCFTR provides a novel therapeutic strategy to synergistically restore the mutant protein function.",

(1) We used protein\u2010binding arrays to screen for protein interactions with mono\u2010SUMO\u20101 or poly\u2010SUMO\u20102/3 chains, to identify targets for SUMO\u2010mediated regulation of CFTR biogenesis/degradation. In protein\u2010binding arrays, several deubiquitylating enzymes were identified, an example is USP28. Another ubiquitin\u2010specific protease, USP11, has recently been reported to be capable of deubiquitylating SUMO\u20102/3\u2010poly\u2010chains that had been ubiquitylated by the SUMO\u2010chain targeted ubiquitin ligase, RNF4, thus counteracting the action of RNF4 in the DNA damage response. (2) To understand the roles of USP11 and USP28 in regulating CFTR biogenesis and degradation, we determined whether these proteins function similarly, to stabilize SUMO\u2010modified CFTR via deubiquitylation. Indeed, the overexpression of either USP11 or USP28 elevated the levels of CFTR expression in both CFBE cells and HEK293 cells. In addition, USP11 also markedly reduced the ubiquitylation of F508del CFTR, whereas catalytically inactive mutant USP11 (C318A) eliminated its ability to augment CFTR expression. Our results also revealed that the USP28\u2010induced CFTR expression increase occurred through USP28\u2010induced reduction in SUMO\u20102/3 modification of F508del CFTR, which reduces RNF4 targeting to CFTR at the substrate level.

However such combined treatment apparently had almost no effect on the diagnostic feature of CF, high sweat chloride levels. (2\u20104) Therefore we assayed the efficacy of these potentially therapeutic drugs on isolated native sweat ducts under near physiological conditions, not only to assess the therapeutic potential in \u201creal\u201d tissue, but also to better understand the physiological basis for differences in responses to these drugs by different tissues; i.e., airways vs. sweat glands. We isolated and microperfused native human sweat ducts derived from fresh skin biopsies of volunteer subjects. (5) We investigated the effect of small molecular weight compounds known to either correct (VX\u2010809) or potentiate CFTR\u2010channel function (VX\u2010770) in normal and CF ducts. Preliminary results indicated that acute treatment of non\u2010CF sweat ducts with either VX\u2010770 or VX\u2010809 (3mM each) had little effect on CFTR Cl\u2010 conductance. Lack of an acute effect of these drugs is not due to endogenous maximal activation of CFTR channel function due to the fact that these drugs had no effect even after complete deactivation of CFTR following permeabilization of the basolateral membrane with a\u2010toxin to deplete CFTR agonists (cAMP and ATP) from the cytosol. However, CFTR Cl\u2010 conductance was significantly enhanced after \u02dc24\u2010hour incubation (23oC) of isolated sweat glands with the drugs either combined or separately. The enhancement of CFTR Cl\u2010 conductance after overnight incubation with the drugs is probably not due to endogenous inhibition of CFTR dephosphorylation by phosphatases since neither VX\u2010770 nor VX\u2010809 had any effect on the deactivation of phosphorylated CFTR after washing out endogenous cAMP in permeabilized ducts. It may be more likely that the extended incubation time increased the synthesis and transport of more CFTR protein to the cell membrane, which enhanced channel function. These preliminary results suggest that extended incubation with VX\u2010770 nor VX\u2010809 is needed to significantly enhance CFTR\u2010Cl\u2010 conductance in sweat ducts. The increased CFTR function was likely not due to an inhibitory effect on endogenous phosphatases that deactivate the CFTR anion channel, but possibly due to an increase of CFTR present in the cell membrane.",

Increasing the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)\u2010localized pool of mutant CFTR available for pharmacologic correction could offer substantial benefits to compound\u2010heterozygous individuals carrying only one copy of F508del. Misfolded F508del CFTR undergoes premature degradation initiated by ubiquitination, followed by targeting to the ER\u2010associated degradation (ERAD) machinery and proteasome. E3 ubiquitin ligases such as gp78 play an important role during the routing of CFTR to degradation, and novel compounds that block CFTR ubiquitination could augment the mutant protein pool acted upon by small molecule correctors. Using the UbiproTM discovery platform, we conducted a primary FRET\u2010based screen of a library containing >220,000 small molecules, and isolated compounds that attenuate ubiquitination catalyzed by gp78. A total of 334 specific gp78 inhibitors were then selected and verified for blockade of recombinant human CFTR NBD2 ubiquitination, and prioritized by their ability to promote surface expression of F508del CFTR\u2010HRP in epithelial cell models. Nineteen compounds were next evaluated for effects on F508del CFTR Band B accumulation and rescue by lumacaftor. Two of these, termed P80142 and P80152, increased F508del CFTR in both HEK293 and FRT cells, and synergistically enhanced chloride transport when combined with lumacaftor. P80142 also increased steady\u2010state levels of other mutant CFTRs such as W1282X (class I defect) and E92K (class II), with synergistic rescue again observed following lumacaftor. These results indicate that inhibition of a specific ubiquitin E3 ligase can augment the reparable pool of F508del CFTR, and point to a novel drug\u2010development strategy. In addition, demonstration that a gp78 modulator improves F508del, W1282X, and E92K stability indicates a shared degradative pathway that could be targeted to enhance correction among patients carrying these alleles. The compounds described are currently being evaluated in primary airway epithelial cells as experimental therapeutics for a broad spectrum of individuals with cystic fibrosis.

Because treatment of heterozygous F508del patients with VX\u2010809 and VX\u2010770 resulted in limited success, it is important to identify heterozygous patients that respond to CFTR modulator therapy. R117H is a more prevalent rare mutation found in over 2000 CF patients. In this study we investigated the effectiveness of VX\u2010809/VX\u2010770 therapy on restoring CFTR function in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells from R117H/F508del CF patients. We found that VX\u2010809 stimulated more CFTR activity in R117H/F508del HBEs than in F508del/F508del HBEs. R117H expressed exclusively in immortalized HBEs exhibited a folding defect and was retained and degraded in the ER. VX\u2010809 corrected the R117H folding defect and restored channel function. Because R117 is involved in ion conductance, VX\u2010770 acted additively with VX\u2010809 to restore CFTR function in chronically treated R117H/F508del cells. Although treatment of R117H patients with VX\u2010770 has been approved, our studies indicate that Orkambi may be more beneficial for rescue of CFTR function in these patients.",

            "text": "Understanding the mode of action of CFTR modulator compounds is key for optimization of CF therapeutics as well as obtaining insights into the molecular mechanisms of CFTR function. Deletion of F508 in NBD1 manifests as misprocessing of the channel and defective channel gating. The mechanism involves destabilization of NBD1 and the NBD1:ICL4 interface and a likely impairment of NBD1/NBD2 dimerization (Chong PA, et al. J Biol Chem. 2015;290:22862\u201078), which is integral to folding, processing and channel gating. We demonstrate here, for the first time, direct binding of VX\u2010809 to human WT and F508del NBD1 (\u0394RI\u0394RE). Disruption of the interaction between C\u2010terminal helices and the NBD1 core upon VX\u2010809 binding is observed from chemical shift changes in the NMR spectra of residues in the helices and on the surface of \u00df\u2010strands S3, S9 and S10. Binding to VX\u2010809 leads to a significant negative Tm shift for NBD1, consistent with disruption of the C\u2010terminal helices upon binding. These NMR binding data and the negative Tm shifts are very similar to those reported by our groups previously for binding of the dual corrector\u2010potentiator CFFT\u2010001 to NBD1 (\u0394RI\u0394RE) (Hudson, RP, et al. J Biol Chem. 2012;287;28480\u201094), suggesting that the two compounds share at least some aspects of their mechanisms of action. An interresidue correlation analysis of the chemical shift changes upon VX\u2010809 binding provides evidence of allosteric coupling between the direct binding site and the NBD1:CL4 interface, which is tightly linked to the NBD dimerization surface. While previous studies have shown an important role for VX\u2010809 in modulating the conformation of MSD1 (Ren HY, et al. Mol Biol Cell. 2013;24:3016\u201024) this additional mode of VX\u2010809 binding provides insight into conformational dynamics and allostery within CFTR. We interpret these data to propose that the action of VX\u2010809 on NBD1 and the subsequent destabilization of helices H8 and H9 contributes to the mechanism of action by allosterically stabilizing NBD1:CL4 interactions and releasing RE/R region from the core of NBD1, thereby promoting NBD dimerization and stabilizing full\u2010length CFTR.

Channel gating studies indicate that the channel rapidly cycles between open and closed conformations, suggesting that the NBD dimers form with a very modest affinity. Dimerization of the isolated NBDs is likely further compromised by disruption of critical interactions between the intracellular loops (ICLs) and the Q\u2010loops of the NBDs. We have previously shown that the Q\u2010loop of the isolated NBD1 domain exchanges between dimer\u2010favorable and dimer\u2010unfavorable positions and that deletion of F508 (F508del) pushes the Q\u2010loop to the dimer\u2010incompatible position (Chong PA, et al. J Biol Chem. 2015;290:22862\u201078). Similarly, in the isolated NBD2 the sidechain of the eponymous Q\u2010loop glutamine, Q1291, flips roughly 180 degrees to hydrogen bond with S1359 (Zhao X, et al. Ped Pulmonol. 2008;43(S31):205). This rotates the alpha\u2010helical subdomain out of a dimer\u2010compatible position. Mutation of S1359 to disrupt this hydrogen bond allows the alpha\u2010helical subdomain to move partway back to a dimer\u2010compatible position. While both of these Q\u2010loop problems may be mitigated by interactions with the ICLs, they nonetheless probably contribute energetically to the modest affinity of the NBD dimers in full\u2010length CFTR. We are using computational and bioinformatics tools to predict mutations that will stabilize the NBDs and NBD1\u2010NBD2 dimers with the dual goal of understanding impediments to NBD heterodimerization in WT and F508del CFTR and obtaining stable NBD dimers for biophysical studies. We have successfully stabilized NBD2 for biophysical studies, including CD and NMR studies. NBD heterodimerization will be assayed using thermal melt assays, NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments and NMR paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE), techniques that we have successfully used to confirm NBD1 homodimerization. We will probe the effects of disease\u2010causing mutations, the C\u2010terminal tail of CFTR, the regulatory insertion and the R region (both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated) on NBD heterodimers. We will provide a progress update on these experiments. This work will also enable studies of small molecule modulators targeted at the NBD dimer interface.

CFTR dysfunction may result from loss\u2010of\u2010function mutations as occurs in CF, or may be acquired when the airways are exposed to air pollutants such as cigarette smoke (Cantin AM, et al. Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2006;173:1139\u201044). The decrease in fluid secretion which occurs when CFTR activity is reduced by inhaled toxicants is expected to exacerbate mucus plugging, infection and inflammation in CF patients. To investigate the impact of environmental contaminants on CFTR function we studied the acute effect of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) on anion secretion by CFBE cells. Exposure to 50% CSE for 30 min suppressed the subsequent stimulation of short circuit current (Isc) by forskolin, and this was accompanied by a decrease in the surface expression of CFTR in cell surface biotinylation assays. The inhibitory effect of CSE on forskolin\u2010stimulated Isc was not blocked by pre\u2010treatment of cells with the MEK1/MEK2 inhibitors U0126 and PD98059. In addition to inhibiting the forskolin response, CSE exposure also caused a large, transient increase in basal Isc which was absent when cells were pretreated with CFTRinh\u2010172 and when CFBE cells expressing F508del CFTR were exposed to CSE. Hydrogen peroxide has been shown previously to stimulate CFTR function and cigarette smoke contains oxidants, therefore we explored the role of reactive oxygen species by pre\u2010treating cells with N\u2010acetylcysteine (NAC). The stimulation by CSE was strongly attenuated after 10 mM NAC, consistent with the involvement of reactive oxygen species. The acute secretory response to CSE may be a host defense mechanism that clears noxious stimuli from the epithelial surface. Support: Canadian Institutes of Health Research.",

This project investigates how small changes in protein sequence can largely affect the folding and subcellular trafficking of CFTR. CFTR mutations can cause misfolding, retention and rapid degradation of premature CFTR in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), en route of its folding pathway. Inherently, the wild\u2010type human CFTR has a low efficiency of protein folding/processing that is exacerbated by these mutations. Second\u2010site mutations that partially \u201crescue\u201d mutant CFTR to the cell surface, have been identified, especially in a 70\u2010amino acid \u03b1\u2010helical subdomain that is located in the first nucleotide\u2010binding domain (Mendoza JL, et al. Cell. 2012;148:164\u201074). This \u03b1\u2010helical subdomain is highly conserved in homologous proteins and is home to the infamous \u0394F508 misfolding mutation. We therefore hypothesize that human CFTR is prone to misfolding due to regions of intrinsic instability in its \u03b1\u2010helical subdomain. Based on sequence alignment of multiple homologous proteins we constructed chimeras between CFTR and its close homolog in yeast, the Yeast Oligomycin Resistance protein (Yor1p), as a tool to identify regions of single or multiple amino acid substitutions that will enhance protein folding and processing. We engineered a Yor1p\u2010CFTR chimera in yeast by replacing the \u03b1\u2010helical subdomain of Yor1p with that of CFTR. We analyzed cellular localization of the green fluorescence protein (GFP)\u2010tagged Yor1p\u2010CFTR chimeras by fluorescence microscopy and steady\u2010state protein levels by SDS\u2010PAGE. The chimera exhibited ER retention indicative of a severe protein folding/processing defect. We identified at least three amino acids in the \u03b1\u2010helical subdomain that are highly conserved in Yor1p and other transporters, but not in CFTR. Substitution of these amino acids in the Yor1p\u2010CFTR chimera restored ER exit and protein stability. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that correcting instabilities within the \u03b1\u2010helical subdomain is an important step to restore human CFTR processing in yeast. This knowledge on CFTR folding may provide insights into regions that may be targeted for the development of effective therapeutic options for CF patients.",

Our goal was to circumvent these challenges and generate a robust reagent for high\u2010throughput screening (HTS) of small molecules and siRNAs that alter CFTR expression and intracellular processing. We used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to introduce an epitope tag into endogenous CFTR in Caco2 cells. We describe a novel cell line in which all three alleles of endogenous CFTR (Caco2 is trisomic for chromosome 7) were replaced by N\u2010terminal mCherry tagged\u2010CFTR. Briefly, CRISPR/Cas9 endonuclease\u2010mediated homologous recombination was used to introduce mCherry into the N\u2010terminus of CFTR by designing a guide RNA in CFTR intron1. A homology directed repair (HDR) template encompassing the mCherry cDNA sequence flanked by an \u02dc 700bp region of homology adjoining the PAM (Protospacer adjacent motif) site in intron 1 was constructed by PCR. Caco2 cells were transfected with PX458 (GFP\u2010tagged Cas9 plasmid expressing a single\u2010guide RNA) and the HDR template using Lipofectamine 2000. Three days after transfection cells were trypsinized and single\u2010cell suspensions were subjected to fluorescence\u2010activated cell sorting (FACS) of GFP and mCherry double\u2010positive cells. Single cells were plated onto 96\u2010well plates, clonally expanded for screening by PCR and sequencing of genomic DNA. Clones that appeared to contain correctly targeted mCherry CFTR were then subjected to assays that confirmed normal CFTR protein synthesis, proper folding and insertion into the cell membrane. First, production of full\u2010length, processed mCherry\u2010CFTR was confirmed by Western blot. Next, confocal microscopy was used to visualize the spatial distribution of mCherry\u2010CFTR and both cytoplasmic and membrane\u2010bound species were detected. Finally, we tested whether the clone could be used in HTS to identify factors affecting CFTR transcription. Depletion of the architectural proteins CTCF/Rad21 (by siRNAs) was shown previously to increase CFTR mRNA and protein expression (Gosalia N, et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 2014;42(15):9612\u201022). We now show that siRNA\u2010mediated knockdown of CTCF/Rad21 in the mCherry\u2010CFTR Caco2 cells increases the cell\u2010surface mCherry\u2010CFTR signal detected by FACS in comparison to negative control siRNAs. We are currently using the same CRISPR/Cas9 toolkit to generate mCherry\u2010CFTR clones from lung, pancreas and epididymis epithelial cells.",

Elp2 is a scaffold protein required for activation of STAT3; Elp2 is also a component of the Elongator complex that appears to regulate a number of cellular processes including RNA polymerase II activity. As other data suggest that increased Hsp70 expression promotes F508del trafficking (2), we hypothesized that increased Elp2 expression will promote F508del trafficking to the plasma membrane. To test this hypothesis, we performed Ussing chamber experiments in CFBE41o\u2010 F508del cells that overexpressed Elp2, or CFBE41o\u2010 wt CFTR cells that were transfected with Elp2 specific siRNA. Overexpression of Elp2 increased CFTR\u2010mediated currents in CFBE41o\u2010 F508del cells, whereas depletion of Elp2 by siRNA in CFBE410\u2010 wt CFTR cells decreased CFTR\u2010mediated currents. Previously, we have shown that increased Hsp70 expression promotes interaction of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) with the Sec24D cargo recognition component of coat complex II (COP II) machinery, which carries protein cargo from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi. In co\u2010immunoprecipitation experiments in IB3\u20101 CF bronchiolar epithelial cells, overexpression of Elp2 increased Hsp70 expression and promoted the interaction of F508del\u2010CFTR and Sec24D. These data provide a mechanistic link of increased Elp2 expression leading to increased Hsp70 expression and, as a result, improved F508del trafficking.",

We initially hypothesized that STAT3 and more specifically activated phospho\u2010STAT3, serves as the Elp2 \u201ccarrier,\u201d as we previously demonstrated that STAT3 translocated to the nucleus after 4PBA treatment (1). We tested this hypothesis using luciferase reporter assays in IB3\u20101 cells, where luciferase expression was controlled by the human Hsp70 promoter. However, overexpression of STAT3 and mutant STAT3 constructs, including a constitutively active STAT3 (STAT\u20103C), and STAT3 tyrosine or serine phosphorylation\u2010deficient mutants (STAT3\u2010Y705F and STAT3\u2010S727A) suggested that the phosphorylation state of STAT3 does not regulate Elp2 translocation to the nucleus and Hsp70 expression in response to 4PBA. Instead overexpression of other elongator complex proteins, namely Elp1 and Elp3, in similar luciferease reporter assays suggested that Elp3, which contains a NLS, may carry Elp2 into the nucleus in response to 4PBA. Together these data suggest a mechanism by which 4PBA can improve F508del trafficking, and potentially identify new targets for intervention.",

Previously, we constructed a variant of nucleotide\u2010binding domain 1 (hNBD1) from human CFTR that maintains native\u2010like stability when a visible fluorophore is covalently bound at a single labeling site, and fluorescence self\u2010quenching (FSQ) of this labeled domain upon unfolding/aggregation provides a robust and accurate high\u2010throughput assay for compounds that offset the temperature\u2010depending folding defect in both isolated F508del\u2010hNBD1 and full\u2010length human F508del\u2010CFTR. Using this FSQ assay, we demonstrated that hNBD1 binds several common nucleotide analogs \u02dc3\u2010fold tighter than ATP \u2010\u2010 the physiological ligand of hNBD1. We demonstrated that these analogs preserve the gating function of F508del\u2010hCFTR channels even at 37\u00b0 C while ATP cannot. We have extended this approach to establish an equivalent FSQ assay for compounds that stabilize the hNBD1\u2010hNBD2 in interface in human CFTR. This assay exploits a recent breakthrough that produced a monodisperse and stable construct of nucleotide\u2010binding domain 2 (hNBD2) from human CFTR. We covalently linked this hNBD2 construct to the hNBD1 construct used in FSQ assay via an 80\u2010residue\u2010long inter\u2010NBD linker from EttA (Energy\u2010dependent translation throttle A) (1, 2), a bacterial protein with two tandem NBDs. Biophysical and structural studies have shown this linker motif from EttA is compatible with functional ATP\u2010mediated heterodimerization of its tandem NBDs, which are homologous to those in CFTR. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) shows that hNBD1 and hNBD2 unfold independently in the resulting hNBD1\u2010(EttA\u2010linker)\u2010hNBD2 fusion protein construct, which is monodisperse at high concentration after purification. We will use the FSQ assay in this construct to screen for compounds that promote tight nucleotide\u2010dependent thermodynamic interaction between hNBD1 and hNBD2. Such compounds would facilitate high\u2010resolution structural studies of the functional hNBD1\u2010hNBD2 interface in human CFTR, which stabilizes the open state of active CFTR channels. Based on the results described above for nucleotide analogs stabilizing isolated hNBD1, such compounds stabilizing the hNBD1\u2010hNBD2 interface could also potentially represent lead compounds for drugs correcting the temperature\u2010sensitive folding defect in full\u2010length human F508del\u2010CFTR.",

This process is generally mediated by the prolonged interaction of CFTR folding mutants with chaperones that cooperate with ubiquitin E2/E3 enzymes. BAG3 has been identified as a co\u2010chaperone of HSP70/HSC70 that can target misfolded and aggregated proteins for selective autophagic degradation.

Biochem J. 2009;425:245\u201055). In the present study, we examined the interaction of Hsp27 with BAG3, since it is possible that Hsp27 interacts with BAG3 similarly to other sHsps. We previously showed that Hsp27 initiates the degradation of F508del CFTR by promoting modification of the mutant by SUMO\u20102/3 (Ahner A, et al. Mol Biol Cell. 2013;24:74\u201084). We show here that overexpressed Hsp22 also reduces the CFTR band B. In view of the recognized interaction of Hsp22 with the BAG3\u2010mediated degradation pathways, it was of interest to evaluate similarities/differences between these pathways for sHsp\u2010mediated degradation. We demonstrated the selective recognition of CFTR band B by BAG3 in direct protein\u2010protein interaction studies, and a BAG3 point mutation, R480A, which blocks its interaction with HSP70, also abolishes BAG3's interaction with immature CFTR. These findings suggest that BAG3 recognition of CFTR requires the cooperation of HSP70. The involvement of the aggresome marker, LC3, in this pathway provided further evidence for selective targeting of BAG3 towards aggresomal structures: aggregates of CFTR were found to be co\u2010localized with LC3 positive compartments in COS7 cells and LC3 was also co\u2010precipitated with CFTR in immunoprecipitation assays. Altogether, these data suggest that the selective disposal of misfolded CFTR can be mediated by aggresome\u2010lysosomal degradation, assisted by chaperone\u2010mediated autophagy, and for CFTR, they identify a role for sHsps in cooperating with BAG3 in this process.

The Phe508 residue lies at an interface of NBD1 and the intracellular cytoplasmic loop 4 (ICL4) in transmembrane domain 2 (TMD2). A recent NMR study indicated that the ICL4 interaction induces an allosterically coupled conformational change in NBD1 at the region of Phe508 and the C\u2010terminal region including beta\u2010stands S9/10 and helices H8/9. Interestingly, S9/10 and H8/9 are located distal to Phe508 in the NBD1 structure, and are critical for CFTR processing and channel activity. Histidine at residue 620 (His620) in S9 is well conserved across species. In human CFTR, amino acid substitution at His620 has been reported for four missense variants, H620Q, H620P, H620L, and H620R. When exogenously expressed in HEK293 cells, three of these, H620P, H620L, and H620R disrupted CFTR maturation. In contrast, H620Q CFTR was properly processed with a similar level of maturation as wild\u2010type CFTR. All four His620 variants in cis with F508del failed to mature. Thus, H620Q is neither a processing defect mutation nor a second\u2010site suppressor. In contrast, H620Q blocked the ability of a small\u2010molecule corrector C18 (a VX\u2010809 analog) to rescue F508del CFTR. Because a mutation R1070W in ICL4 perturbs the NBD1\u2010ICL4 contact without any direct alteration of NBD1 folding, we examined its effect on CFTR biogenesis in cis with H620Q. H620Q/R1070W CFTR further decreased a level of maturation and C18 response compared to that of R1070W CFTR. These results imply that H620Q exerts a mild folding defect on NBD1, which aggravates the biosynthetic defects of F508del CFTR. Enhancement of NBD1 folding by deletion of RI (RIdel) or restoration of NBD1\u2010ICL4 contact by introduction of a second\u2010site suppressor R1070W partially rescued F508del/H620Q CFTR, but H620Q still lowered the level of C18\u2010rescue compared to F508del CFTR. Our results indicate that allosteric folding effects of the NBD1 C\u2010terminal region play a role in C18\u2010mediated correction of F508del CFTR. C18 response to the allosteric folding defects of F508del CFTR can be partially restored by combination of the two separate folding mechanisms \u2010 improvement of NBD1 folding and facilitation of NBD1\u2010TMD2 interdomain assembly.

J Mol Biol. 2015;16:106\u201020). Importantly, their corrective effect was also shown to positively correlate with the extent of NBD1 thermal stabilization. The latter observation enables NBD1 stabilization to predict F508del\u2010CFTR correction. A subset of these mutations was also shown to increase exogenous expression levels of WT CFTR, as well as the purification yield and thermostability of reconstituted channel activity (Aleksandrov, et al. Protein Expr Purif. 2015;116:159\u201066). The immediate goal of the present study was to extend the previous work to identify additional NBD1 mutations that maximally stabilize the isolated domain when combined; some of these, like M470V, are newly reported NBD1 stabilizers. Using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the unfolding temperatures (Tm) of 14 single stabilizing mutants in NBD1 (aa 387\u2010646, \u0394405\u2010436) were determined. Various combinations of two, three or more were also introduced into NBD1 for Tm determination. More than 20 such NBD1 mutants were studied and it was found that the stabilizing effect was generally additive; exceptions were noted and will be presented. The largest stabilizing effect was observed with a combination of 6 top\u2010ranked single mutations, which increased the NBD1 Tm by close to 30oC over WT NBD1 (aa 387\u2010646). A smaller subset was also introduced into the F508del\u2010NBD1 and some differences in the extent of stabilization were found. To correlate Tm\u2010shifts with structural parameters, and ultimately predict Tm\u2010shifts of new mutations, the 14 single mutations were modeled into the existing NBD1 structure (PDB ID: 2PZE) of the NBD1 construct studied here. Changes in solvent\u2010accessible surface area were calculated, and the free energy of stabilization (\u0394\u0394G) was computed using several different \u0394\u0394G prediction algorithms. Favorable qualitative and quantitative correlations between the predicted \u0394\u0394G and the actual Tm\u2010shifts were found, setting the basis for predicting the effect of future mutations on NBD1 stability. Such predictions could be potentially extended to full\u2010length CFTR. Selected combo\u2010mutations were introduced in human WT FL CFTR, expressed in mammalian cells, purified and their unfolding temperatures determined. A positive correlation between NBD1 Tm and CFTR Tm was observed and results will be shown. A detailed analysis of the thermal unfolding will be presented in another poster (Urbatsch et al.).

VX\u2010809 (Selleck Chem.) was applied (10 and 20 \u03bcM) for 16h in HEK293 stably expressing the mutants. R1108C and R1129C express 60% less protein than wt ABCA4. Large increases in mutant protein levels occurred in cells grown at 27oC demonstrating that both mutants just like many CFTR trafficking mutants are temperature sensitive. When translation was inhibited, mutant proteins rapidly disappeared, whereas wt\u2010ABCA4 remained stable. The data indicate that these mutant ABCA4 proteins are unstable and rapidly degraded similar to \u0394F508\u2010CFTR. The corrector VX\u2010809 increased total protein and cell surface expression of R1108C and R1129C by 1.5 and 2 fold, respectively. In contrast the effect of VX\u2010809 on A1038V and G1961E was greater increasing the steady\u2010state protein levels by between 2 and 3 fold with the greatest response noted with A1038V. Following treatment with VX\u2010809 both mutants can now be observed at the plasma membrane as assessed by surface biotinylation suggesting that trafficking to the plasma membrane is restored. Interestingly, VX\u2010809, considered to be a class 1 corrector, was effective in increasing the steady\u2010state protein levels of ABCA4 mutants whereas the combination of class 1 and 2 was not additive compared to VX\u2010809 alone. This is in contrast to \u0394F508\u2010CFTR where combination of Class 1 and 2 correctors is most effective. Our studies show that Hsp 27 and 40 are important for the rescue of \u0394F508\u2010CFTR but not the ABCA4 mutants where VX\u2010809 may rescue the mutant protein by a direct effect on the folding.",

Both cell lines display small steady\u2010state amounts of truncated, R1162X and W1282X proteins. Surprisingly, when treated with the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, steady\u2010state levels of R1162X and W1282X increase by 20\u2010 and 6\u2010fold respectively. Smaller but significant increases were noted when HDAC6 was inhibited by tubacin. Application of a combination of small molecule correctors C4 + 18 increased steady\u2010state levels of truncated protein of R1162X and W1282X between 2\u20103 fold. These data indicate that truncated protein is produced but rapidly degraded. The combination of C4+18 plus gentamicin (800 \u03bcg/mL for 24h) produced 5\u2010 and 10\u2010fold increases in CFTR protein respectively. To determine whether the chloride transport function of R1162X\u2010 and W1282X CFTR can be restored, we performed short circuit current experiments. CFTR\u2010dependent chloride currents increased approximately 2\u2010fold for both mutants when treated with the combination of C4+18.

In response to bacterial infection macrophages migrate into the lungs where they phagocytose and kill bacteria and release several cytokines including IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20106, IL\u20108, IL\u201010 and TNF\u2010\u03b1. However, in CF, macrophages exhibit a reduced ability to kill P. aeruginosa and manifest increased cytokine secretion compared to non\u2010CF macrophages. Several reports have demonstrated that CFTR is expressed in macrophages and the bactericidal activity of macrophages is defective in CF. Moreover, inhibition of wt\u2010CFTR by CFTRinh\u2010172 reduces phagocytosis by macrophages. By contrast, VX\u2010325 increases the export of F508del\u2010CFTR from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane and F508del\u2010CFTR\u2010dependent Cl\u2010 currents in CF monocytes. We have shown that VX\u2010325 increases the abundance of F508del\u2010CFTR in immune cell phagolysosomes, which play an important role in bactericidal activity. Recent clinical trials with VX\u2010809 + VX\u2010770 (Orkambi) in CF patients homozygous for the F508del mutation have demonstrated a small increase in FEV1 and a decrease in the rate of exacerbations. However there are no studies on the effect of VX\u2010809 + VX\u2010770 on the ability of macrophages to phagocytose and kill P. aeruginosa. Thus, the goal of this study was to examine the ability of VX\u2010809 + VX\u2010770 to stimulate CF macrophages to phagocytose and kill P. aeruginosa and to reduce cytokine secretion. Stable subjects with CF (n = 5, F508del/F508del) donated blood and isolated monocytes were differentiated into macrophages (monocyte\u2010derived macrophages, MDM) by incubation with M\u2010CSF (100 ng/mL) for 7 days. VX\u2010809 (3 \u03bcM) increased the phagocytic uptake of P. aeruginosa compared to vehicle\u2010treated MDMs by 84%. Although the combination of VX\u2010809 (3 \u03bcM) + VX\u2010770 (5 \u03bcM) also increased the phagocytic uptake of P. aeruginosa, compared to vehicle\u2010treated MDMs, the increase was 36%, a value significantly less than with VX\u2010809 alone. VX\u2010809 alone increased the ability of MDMs to kill phagocytosed P. aeruginosa by 110% compared to vehicle\u2010treated MDMs. VX\u2010809 + VX\u2010770 also increased the ability of MDMs to kill P. aeruginosa compared to vehicle\u2010treated MDMs by 27%, a value less than the increase with VX\u2010809 alone. Preliminary studies also revealed that VX\u2010809 decreased P. aeruginosa\u2010stimulated secretion of IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20106, IL\u20108, IL\u201010 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 by MDMs by 54%, 28%, 24%, 60%, and 32%, respectively. Moreover, the combination of VX\u2010809 + VX\u2010770 was more effective in decreasing P. aeruginosa\u2010stimulated cytokine secretion by MDMs than VX\u2010809 alone. VX\u2010809 + VX\u2010770 reduced P. aeruginosa\u2010stimulated IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20106, IL\u20108, IL\u201010 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 secretion by 60%, 99%, 67%, 99% and 97%, respectively. In conclusion, VX\u2010809 increased the ability of CF MDMs to phagocytose and kill P. aeruginosa, while VX\u2010770 reduced the efficacy of VX\u2010809 to stimulate the ability of CF MDMs to phagocytose and kill P. aeruginosa.

Increasing evidence suggests that CF neutrophils possess an intrinsic and pathological inflammatory defect.

In neutrophils, HVCN\u20101 is central to the sustained activity of the NADPH oxidase upon uptake of a pathogen. Murine HVCN\u20101 knockout studies have demonstrated an increased phagosomal pH, significantly higher primary granule degranulation and reduced killing by neutrophils. As CF neutrophils demonstrate increased primary granule degranulation we hypothesised that CF cells may have reduced abundance of HVCN\u20101.

Chronic lung infections result in chronic lung inflammation which creates a paradox where most anti\u2010inflammatory therapies can suppress an already inadequate lung immune response. Recently we have reported that the lung's innate immune response can generate hypothiocyanite that can be selectively metabolized by the host's thioredoxin reductase (metazoan type) but not the pathogen's thioredoxin reductase (non\u2010metazoan type). In fact, bacterial thioredoxin reductase is readily inhibited by hypothiocyanite. Thioredoxin reductase is a critical enzyme that supplies an essential cofactor, thioredoxin, for ribonucleotide reductase which converts RNA to DNA. The potential importance of this pathway in the CF lung is that thiocyanate, the substrate for hypothiocyanate formation, is a small anion that is transported by CFTR and is dysfunctional in CF.",

In eukaryotes, the SLC26A STAS domain is composed of two highly conserved regions bracketing a unique intervening sequence (IVS); the specific region(s) involved in the interaction with CFTR have not been identified. SLC26A9, found in several epithelia including the airways, functions as a constitutively active chloride channel that, when co\u2010expressed with wt CFTR, results in a synergistic increase in the response to cAMP stimulation.

A search of NCBI's single\u2010nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) database identified several SNPs within the IVS. One SNP (rs149474736, S594F), located in a predicted CK2 phosphorylation site also predicted to be part of a 14\u20103\u20103 binding motif, led to striking changes. When expressed alone in HEK293 cells, SLC26A9\u2010S594F produced a whole\u2010cell constitutive chloride current of 191 \u00b1 41 pA (n=4), similar to native SLC26A9. When SLC26A9\u2010S594F was co\u2010expressed with wt CFTR, however, constitutive chloride current increased more than 6\u2010fold to 1274 \u00b1 214 pA (n=17), significantly greater than that observed with co\u2010expression of native SLC26A9 and wt CFTR (195 \u00b1 30 pA, n=9). Cell surface biotinylation did not show increased SLC26A9\u2010S594F protein at the plasma membrane relative to wt SLC26A9, suggesting that the increased activity resulted from the interaction of this variant with CFTR. Because S594 is a predicted phosphorylation site, we also tested alanine and aspartic acid substitutions. Interestingly, SLC26A9\u2010S594A produced the opposite pattern seen with S594F, with high constitutive activity when expressed alone that was substantially diminished with co\u2010expression of wt CFTR.

            "text": "Recently, rehydration agents have been gaining attention in treatment of patients with muco\u2010obstructive lung disease, particularly cystic fibrosis (CF). One such agent is inhaled hypertonic saline (HS), which purportedly creates a luminal osmotic ion gradient, drawing additional water onto the dehyrated (concentrated) airway surface layer (ASL). HS has been reported to improve mucus clearance rates, lung function, and reduce the number of acute exacerbations. However, the mechanism and duration of action for mucus hydrating agents to accelerate clearance in CF patients is poorly understood. The mucus layer is a polymer gel that can swell or shrink upon addition or removal of water. Typically, the hydration of the mucus layer is controlled by ion transport across the epithelium. However, in CF, the dysregulation of CFTR\u2010mediated ion transport results in airway fluid depletion and mucin hyperconcentration. We hypothesize that the kinetics of mucus swelling (by added fluid) are determined by the balance between the driving force from osmotic pressure and reversible associations of mucin globular domains, the resistive force from friction of the fluid (i.e. solvent) penetrating through the mesh of mucin network, and the elasticity of the stretched mucins. Further, we hypothesize that there are two stages of mucus swelling: 1) the rapid osmotic gel swelling phase, in which mucus swells without significant rearrangement of inter\u2010molecular associations, and 2) the slow mucus dissolution state in which the mucin molecules continue to rearrange to reduce overlap with one other. To test our hypotheses, we developed a novel dual\u2010labeling imaging technique, to monitor the swelling kinetics of the mucus layer over a range of concentations in reponse to exposure to isotonic solutions. In each experiment, mucus\u2010swelling kinetics were normalized as the increase of swelling height (ht) to the initial height (ho) of the mucus layer [(ht\u2010h0)/h0] and recorded as a function of time (t). Our results demonstrate that the kinetics of mucus swelling depend on specific mucus properties, e.g., increased initial mucus concentrations and osmotic pressures lead to a faster and longer swelling in all kinds of mucus. CF sputum samples and mucus from human airway cultures show a 2\u2010phase swelling curve, with a fast followed by slow phase until dissolution. This behavior contrasts to mucus obtained from porcine glands (stimulated with acetylcholine), which exhibits a fast swelling phase but then reaches an equilibrium swelling plateau, suggesting that gland mucus is biochemically/biophysically different from superficial mucus. From a therapeutic perspective, we envision our model system can be applied to test the effectiveness of mucus hydrating agents and other mucolytics designed to re\u2010establish the normal hydration status of the ASL and facilitate efficient mucus clearance.

Inhaled hypertonic saline (7% NaCl) is delivered to people with CF in an attempt to promote mucus clearance. Because an increased ionic strength inhibits ASL antimicrobial factors, we added tromethamine to hypertonic saline and applied it to CF sputum. We found that tromethamine alone and in combination with hypertonic saline increased pH and enhanced bacterial killing.

Epithelial cells regulate the ion and fluid balance; therefore, they are the cornerstone of keeping fluid balance in the airway. As the major contribution of liquid secretion in the upper airway, airway submucosal glands play a major role in secreting airway surface liquid into the large airway. On the other hand in the distal airway, where there are no submucosal glands, the regulation of airway surface liquid layer depends on the balance of secretion and absorption of ions and fluid by the surface epithelia.

Recently, we showed that inhalation of Pseudomoas aeruginosa triggered ASL secretion in the upper swine airway ex vivo, and we also suggested a basal spontaneous ASL secretion may protect the airway in normal airway. We hypothesized that in CF airways those responses fail, which leads to the failure to eradicate pathogens.

The nociceptive transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) calcium channels have recently been found involved in non\u2010neurogenic inflammation. Here, we investigated the role of TRPA1 in CF respiratory inflammatory models in vitro. Expression of TRPA1 was evaluated in CF lung tissue sections and cells by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Epithelial cell lines (A549, IB3\u20101, CuFi\u20101, CFBE41o\u2010) and primary cells from CF patients were utilized to a) check TRPA1 function modulation, by Fura\u20102 calcium imaging; b) down\u2010modulate TRPA1 function and expression with pharmacological inhibitors (HC\u2010030031 and A\u2010967079) and siRNA silencing; and c) assess the effect of TRPA1 down\u2010modulation on expression and release of cytokines upon exposure to pro\u2010inflammatory challenges, by qRT\u2010PCR and 27\u2010protein Bioplex assay. TRPA1 channels are expressed in the CF pseudostratified columnar epithelium facing the bronchial lumina exposed to bacteria, where IL\u20108 is co\u2010expressed. Inhibition of TRPA1 expression results in a relevant reduction of release of several cytokines, including IL\u20108 and the pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines IL\u20101\u03b2 and TNF\u2010\u03b1, in CF primary bronchial epithelial cells exposed to P. aeruginosa and to the supernatant of mucopurulent material (SMM) derived from the chronically infected airways of CF patients. In conclusion, TRPA1 channels are involved in regulating the extent of airway inflammation driven by CF bronchial epithelial cells.",

Dysregulated intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis in CF bronchial epithelial cells has been claimed as a potential druggable target to compensate for CFTR Cl\u2010 transport defect and/or to reduce excessive CF lung inflammation (as a summary see the Figure). However, the precise identification of the Ca2+ transporter/channel to be targeted is contradictory and requires further understanding on the pros and cons of pharmacological modulation of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. Here we present results focusing on the role of some of the intracellular Ca2+ modulators activated upon interaction of P. aeruginosa with bronchial epithelial cells, inducing the classical intracellular pro\u2010inflammatory signaling leading to upregulation of IL\u20108, IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20106 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 release. We previously showed that direct interaction of P. aeruginosa with toll\u2010like receptors (TLR2, 5 and 4) strongly overexpresses the IL\u20108 gene by MyD88/dependent phosphorylation of mitogen activated protein kinases ERK1/2, p38, JNK, and downstream kinases RSK1/2 and HSP27, leading to intranuclear translocation of transcription factors such as NF\u2010kB, NF\u2010IL6, AP\u20101, CREB and CHOP. Release of ATP in the extracellular milieu is able to sustain a P2Y purinergic receptors\u2010 and phospolipase C beta 3\u2010dependent release of intracellular Ca2+ which potentiates the MyD88\u2010dependent inflammatory pathways. More recently, we observed that flagellin from P. aeruginosa alters in a CF\u2010specific manner the Ca2+ homeostasis, leading to mitochondrial perturbation with increased Ca2+ influx and production of reactive oxygen species, which drives to exaggerated inflammasome activation and the release of IL\u20101b. This opens further questions on the role of the different intracellular Ca2+ compartments and subcellular domains, widening the panel of candidate molecular targets to be considered.",

Recently it was shown that \u02dc60% of aged CF mice develop intestinal polyps and altered Wnt/\u03b2\u2010catenin signaling, a pathway responsible for intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation (Than BL, et al. Oncogene. 2016:doi:10.1038/onc.2015.483). Based on previous evidence of intestinal hyperproliferation in CF mice, we investigated two hypotheses using sex\u2010matched wild\u2010type (WT) and Cftr knockout (KO) mice. In the first hypothesis, we asked whether Cftr KO intestinal hyperproliferation was either an epithelial\u2010autonomous effect of Cftr loss or secondary to the environmental conditions of the CF intestine. For this study, comparisons were made between freshly isolated intestinal crypts (ex vivo) and intestinal epithelial crypt organoids (enteroids) grown and passaged in primary culture. Relative to WT, ex vivo Cftr KO crypts and Cftr KO enteroids (devoid of inflammation, microbiome, systemic factors) had similar increases in epithelial proliferation (+34% vs.+37%), numbers of ISCs (30% vs 74%) and levels of active \u03b2\u2010catenin and the Wnt target gene Lef1. Previous studies have shown that binding of the signaling mediator disheveled (Dvl) to the Wnt receptor frizzled (Fz) is stabilized by a pH\u2010sensitive interaction at the plasma membrane that facilitates Wnt signaling. Since we have shown that the Cftr KO crypt epithelium maintains an alkaline intracellular pH (Liu J, et al. Am J Physiol Cell Physiol. 2012;302:C1492\u2010503), it was hypothesized that Dvl would be more closely associated with the plasma membrane in Cftr KO relative to WT enteroids. Using enteroids from Cftr KO and WT mice bred to Dvl2\u2010EGFP/Rosa plasma membrane dTomato mice, it was found that Dvl2\u2010EGFP more closely associated with the plasma membrane at the apical pole of crypt base cells in Cftr KO crypts. Reduction of Dvl2 association at the apical pole by reducing intracellular pH in Cftr KO enteroids was correlated with decreased active \u03b2\u2010catenin and proliferation. We conclude that 1) intestinal hyperproliferation in the Cftr KO intestine is an epithelial\u2010autonomous consequence of Cftr loss; and 2) a potential mechanism of increased Wnt/\u03b2\u2010catenin signaling and hyperproliferation in the Cftr KO intestine is increased Dvl2 plasma membrane association resulting from dysregulated intracellular pH in crypt base cells.

TGF\u03b2 has also been identified as a genetic modifier of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. In addition, TGF\u03b2 levels are elevated in the plasma and lower airways of CF patients, with relationships to infectious status and lung disease severity (Harris W, et al. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2011;46:688\u201095). However, it is unclear how TGF\u03b2 negatively impacts CF lung disease. A clearer understanding of TGF\u03b2's effects on CF lung disease may allow better selection of patient\u2010specific treatment regimens. Our group has previously demonstrated that exposure of primary human airway epithelial cells in vitro to TGF\u03b2 downregulates both CFTR and an alternate chloride transporter, TMEM16A (Sun H, et al. PLoS One. 2014;9(9)). Previously, we have also shown that brief pulmonary administration of recombinant TGF\u03b2 to mice was sufficient to downregulate CFTR and TMEM16A, as well as induce mucous cell hyperplasia. Here, we examine the effects of TGF\u03b2 overexpression via an adenoviral vector in mouse lungs.

More specifically, the CF pathogenesis is characterized by the build\u2010up of viscous mucus in organs such as the lungs, sinuses, intestine, pancreas and reproductive tract. For this reason, CF is also known as mucoviscidosis, suggesting that polymeric, gel\u2010forming mucins, the large O\u2010linked glycoproteins responsible for the viscoelastic properties of mucus, play a critical role in the disease. CFTR malfunction causes reduced transepithelial Cl\u2010 secretion, Na+ hyperabsorption, and mucin hyperconcentration, which results in slowed mucociliary clearance (MCC). Our goal is to understand the factors that regulate mucus viscoelasticity and restore normal mucus properties in CF. Ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator (e.g., targeting G551D mutation), was shown to yield large improvements in lung function. Ivacaftor was also shown to dramatically increase the rate of MCC and significantly improve ventilation defects, suggesting an effect on mucus biophysical properties. However, direct effects of CFTR rescue on mucin concentration and mucus transportability have not been established.",

Using these two approaches, we showed that gut mucus was more concentrated in cf mice (7.7% vs 4.6% in WT mice) and bead sub\u2010diffusivity was reduced 100\u2010fold in cf mucus, confirming a robust gut/mucus phenotype in this model.

High\u2010dose ibuprofen is currently the only anti\u2010inflammatory approved by the CF Foundation, where benefits include decreased lung disease progression, reduced neutrophil migration, and decreased propensity for nasal polyp growth; however, the mechanism of action is unclear. Further, only 3.3% of patients are prescribed high\u2010dose ibuprofen due to potential side effects, including gastrointestinal bleeding and renal injury. There is a clear need to understand the mechanism of ibuprofen efficacy in order to develop an effective and safer replacement. Previously in our lab, we have reported that microtubule acetylation expression and polymerization rates are decreased in CF epithelial cells. The decrease in microtubule formation rate contributes to decreased intracellular transport and thus inflammatory signaling. Here, we hypothesize that high\u2010dose ibuprofen improves inflammation via improved microtubule structure and dynamics. Microtubule polymerization rates were analyzed by the initiation of microtubule formation, where the percent of cells with an alpha\u2010tubulin aster at various time points was determined. After high\u2010dose ibuprofen (500\u03bcM) for 24 hours, there was a 33.5% increase in CF (IB3\u20101) cells with asters after 8 minutes of re\u2010polymerization, normalizing it to wild\u2010type cells. Functionally, there were 45% less CF cells with accumulated cholesterol after being treated with high\u2010dose ibuprofen, indicating a reinstatement of intracellular transport. Comparing microtubule polymerization rates to other analgesics and cyclooxygenase inhibitors (ie aspirin, acetaminophen, and celecoxib), the reformation of microtubules was specific to high\u2010dose ibuprofen, where no other drug significantly increased CF microtubule formation rates. Enhanced microtubule polymerization was confirmed in primary human nasal epithelial (HNE) cells obtained from CF patients after ibuprofen treatment. Mechanistically, effects of ibuprofen were mimicked by stimulation of AMPK (AICAR, 500 \u03bcM, 24h), where there was a 34.6% increase in CF (IB3\u20101) cells with asters after 8 minutes of re\u2010polymerization and a 51.2% reduction in CF cells with accumulated cholesterol. Effects of ibuprofen were blocked with AMPK inhibitor compound c. It is concluded that high\u2010dose ibuprofen treatment enhances microtubule formation in CF cells likely through an AMPK\u2010related pathway, implicating microtubule structure and dynamics as an important facet linking CFTR to inflammation.

However, pathophysiologic changes to the CF BALF proteome that are independent of bacterial infection have been difficult to discern from human studies. In the present study, we collected BALF from 3 CF and 3 non\u2010CF adult (2 to 3 years old) ferrets maintained on three synergistic antibiotics for life (piperacillin/tazobactam, enrofloxacin, and metronidazole). Culturable bacteria in the BALF were not significantly different between genotypes (non\u2010CF: 60\u00b1104 CFU; CF: 60\u00b179 CFU). In contrast to our proteomic studies in newborn CF and non\u2010CF ferrets (Keiser NW, et al. Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 2015;52:683\u201094), the BALF obtained from adult ferrets contained high levels of albumin, presenting a significant barrier to analyzing the proteome. In order to increase the dynamic coverage and improve protein discovery, BALF samples were first fractionated using OFFGEL isoelectric focusing in urea buffer and albumin fractions were removed. BALF processed using this technique was then subjected to LC\u2010MS/MS to identify proteomic content. Overall, a total of 244 and 247 proteins were identified in non\u2010CF and CF BALF samples, respectively. Of these proteins, 232 were common to both genotypes with 12 and 15 unique proteins in the non\u2010CF and CF BALF, respectively. Semi\u2010quantitative analysis of LC\u2010MS/MS results was performed using the total ionization intensity of each peptide detected per protein. Highly elevated levels of numerous inflammation and immunity related proteins with established antimicrobial activity were observed in the CF BALF when compared to the non\u2010CF. In particular, RNASE6, CHIT1, CD177, MPO, CFHR4, LGALS3 and LTF protein levels were much higher in CF BALF compared to the non\u2010CF. Furthermore, CF BALF had elevated levels of proteases/antiproteaes. Levels of MMP8, CTSG, LTF, ANPEP, HSP90AA1, PSMB1 and CFB proteases were higher in CF BALF. While most antiproteases such as MUC5B, C5, A2M and SERPINA4 levels were elevated in CF BALF, some antiproteases (SLPI, SERPINA1, A5 and D1) were lower in CF compared to non\u2010CF BALF, an implication of a protease/antiprotease imbalance within the BALF. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was employed to determine the canonical and disease pathways of both non\u2010CF and CF BALF proteome. While the predominant non\u2010CF canonical pathways included acute phase response signaling and LXR/RXR activation, the predominant canonical pathways for CF proteins were in complement system activation. Disease or bio\u2010function analysis demonstrated that a number of \u201ccell movement\u201d related genes were either increased (CF, MIF, ALDOA, CFB, MMP8, SOD1, LGALS3, TKT) or decreased (AGT, GAPDH, SFTPD, TUBB, ICAM1, BPIFA1, ENO1, PDIA3) in CF samples. This study provides insights into CF\u2010associated changes in the lung under strong antibiotic selection against bacterial growth.",

            "text": "With approximately 70,000 sufferers and 8 million carriers, cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common lethal genetic diseases worldwide. Mutations within the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene result in altered anion (Cl\u2010 and HCO3\n\u2010) secretion across airway epithelia. This, in combination with hyperabsorption of Na+, via the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), leads to reduced airway surface liquid (ASL) volume, impaired mucociliary clearance, chronic inflammation and bacterial colonization in cystic fibrosis (CF) airways. Excessive volumes of mucopurulent material (MM) present within CF airways results in airway obstruction and in turn airway obstructive disease, reported to account for up to 8 out of 10 deaths in CF patients. In addition, MM present within CF lungs contains numerous proteases which may abnormally regulate ENaC activation and degrade ASL proteins required for innate defense. We have previously reported that the secreted protein, SPLUNC1, regulates ENaC activity and ASL hydration levels and that SPLUNC1's regulation of ENaC is defective in CF airways. (1) Furthermore as past studies have shown that proteases cleave SPLUNC1, we hypothesize that proteases present within CF mucopurulent material can cleave SPLUNC1 and may alter its ability to regulate ENaC. Postmortem MM was harvested from Pseudomonas aeruginosa\u2010 and Staphyloccocus aureus\u2010positive CF lungs. SPLUNC1 levels were determined by Western blot following incubation with MM at 37\u00b0C, in the presence or absence of protease inhibitors. Significant breakdown of 10 \u03bcM SPLUNC1 was observed after incubation with MM diluted 1:2 with PBS (t1/2 = 1.17 hours; N = 3). MM was pre\u2010incubated with protease inhibitors including aprotinin, EDTA, E64 and leupeptinin to determine which enzymes were responsible for SPLUNC1's cleavage. These compounds failed to inhibit SPLUNC1 cleavage (all N = 3). Sivelestat, a neutrophil elastase (NE) inhibitor, significantly prevented SPLUNC1 cleavage (10\u03bcM **** p < 0.0001, N = 4). Given that SPLUNC1 regulates ENaC activity and SPLUNC1 is cleaved by MM, the effects of MM and SPLUNC1, alone and in combination, on ENaC protein levels in normal human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) were investigated. Proteolytic cleavage of \u03b3ENaC is indicated from our preliminary data (N = 3), with increased levels of cleaved \u03b3ENaC subunit expression observed compared with controls. Conversely, decreased \u03b3ENaC protein levels, consistent with ENaC degradation and reduced ENaC activity, were evident in normal HBECs incubated with SPLUNC1 alone or SPLUNC1 and MM in combination. The effect of SPLUNC1 and MM in CF HBECs remains to be determined. In conclusion, we have shown that MM readily cleaves SPLUNC1, and that cleavage can be prevented by the neutrophil elastase inhibitor sivelestat. Abnormal cleavage of SPLUNC1 in CF MM may impair SPLUNC1's ability to regulate innate defense in CF airways.",

Inhibition occurs at the plasma membrane and does not rely on the regulatory (R) domain. Patch\u2010clamp experiments also indicate that inhibition is not membrane delimited which suggests that the effect relies on an intracellular factor. Experiments performed with mutant channels showed that channels with increased activity have a decreased sensitivity to inhibition by SMase; conversely, mutations that decrease channel activity increase sensitivity to inhibition, which suggests that inhibition represents CFTR being locked into a closed state. Finally, we found that Kalydeco pretreatment can protect CFTR from the inhibitory effect of SMase supporting the conclusion that SMase targets a closed state of CFTR.",

Failure to survive beyond the neonatal period by 5 piglets was judged to result from metabolic dysfunction likely related to the genetic manipulation for CFTR gut expression or due to cloning artifact. Plasma analysis of neonatal animals showed very low plasma proteins, highly elevated liver enzymes, and severe acidosis. All surviving offspring received furosemide for systemic edema. One piglet survived to 2 weeks with intensive care and was humanely euthanized due to respiratory distress and generalized, severe edema. At necropsy, findings suggested that the clinical features observed were unrelated to any CF phenotype and were consistent with what was observed in the neonatal animals. Physiologic evaluation was performed with lung tissues from the 2 pigs that survived to 2 months of age. Both acetylcholine\u2010 and forskolin\u2010induced mucous liquid secretion were significantly lower in CF bronchi than non\u2010CF bronchi. The percent nonvolatile solids in mucus secreted from CF bronchi was elevated following acetylcholine or forskolin compared to mucus secreted from non\u2010CF bronchi.

The diameter of CF tracheas was less than that of non\u2010CF pigs in spite of their greater body weight.

            "text": "Epidemiological studies suggest that antiviral host defenses may be compromised in people with cystic fibrosis (CF), as patients exhibit prolonged recovery times and frequent hospitalizations in association with viral respiratory infections. In vitro studies implicate impaired antiviral responses in airway epithelia as a feature of this phenotype. The airways are home to multilayered antiviral host defenses, which may be cell\u2010based or extracellular. Compared with non\u2010CF cells, CF airway epithelia support greater levels of viral infection and replication when infected with several classes of respiratory viruses, and exhibit dysregulated expression of several gene products involved in host defense. In this study, we hypothesized that airway surface liquid exhibits direct antiviral activity and, further, that the antiviral activity of respiratory secretions is reduced in CF. To test these hypotheses, we developed an in vitro assay to measure the innate antiviral activity present in native airway secretions from CF and non\u2010CF pigs. We found that cell\u2010free tracheal and nasal secretions from newborn non\u2010CF pigs exhibited dose\u2010dependent inhibitory activity against several enveloped and encapsidated viruses including Sendai virus (SeV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, and adenovirus. This activity, which was heat labile, was also detected in human nasal secretions. Importantly, we found that the anti\u2010SeV activity of nasal secretions from newborn CF pigs was significantly diminished relative to non\u2010CF littermate controls. When we mixed CF and non\u2010CF secretions at varying ratios, we observed a correlation between the amount of non\u2010CF secretions and anti\u2010SeV activity, suggesting the possibility of reduced abundance or function of antiviral factors in CF secretions. Based on previous reports that cathepsin activity is elevated in CF airway fluids from human subjects, we measured cysteine protease activity in newborn CF and non\u2010CF pig secretions. We found increased cathepsin B, L, and S\u2010like activity in BAL from newborn CF pigs, relative to non\u2010CF littermates; similarly, we observed a trend toward increased cathepsin B activity in newborn CF nasal secretions. We observed that the anti\u2010SeV activity of the pig antimicrobial peptide protegrin\u20101 was abolished by pre\u2010treatment with cathepsin B, suggesting that increased cathepsin activity may negatively influence the activity of secreted antiviral factors. Our data indicate that native airway secretions exhibit inhibitory activity against viruses, and that, at birth, the antiviral capacity of CF airway secretions is diminished relative to non\u2010CF. Future studies will investigate the possible contributions of secreted proteases to this phenomenon, as well as the overall impact of loss of CFTR function on cellular and extracellular antiviral defenses on the onset and progression of CF lung disease.",

This process of activation allows the macrophage to respond and function appropriately to preserve tissue homeostasis.

Although several mechanisms linking abnormal ion secretion and inflammatory dysregulation have been suggested, the link between CFTR function and altered inflammatory response needs to be better understood.

We and others have shown that CFTR in LRM is a critical modulator of the inflammatory and the immune responses.

Among the 332 proteins, 22 proteins showed significant ratio variations after TNF\u2010\u03b1 stimulation.

            "text": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) airway disease is characterized by thickened mucus of increased viscoelastic properties which results in poor clearance from the lung and increased infection and airway inflammation. Currently, there is a debate in the CF community as to the cause of pathologically thickened mucus. One hypothesis is that defective chloride transport by absent or misfolded cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) results in sodium hyperabsorption to maintain intracellular ionic balance. In this hypothesis, water moves with sodium from the airway lumen into the underlying cellular epithelium, thereby dehydrating the airway surface layer (ASL) and creating a high concentration mucus with increased viscoelastic properties. A competing hypothesis is that the defective CFTR inhibits bicarbonate secretion into the ASL which results in acidification of the ASL, thereby increasing the rheological properties of the mucus layer and impeding clearance. We seek to define the relative contributions of each competing hypothesis (mucus pH and concentration) to the increased viscoelastic properties of CF mucus. We perform all of our assays on mucus harvested from our human bronchial epithelial cell culture model system which allows for control of mucus concentration as defined by % solids dry weight, as well as the pH. Our results show that altering pH from 8 to 6 results in a doubling of the viscosity of mucus of 2% solids mucus. However, our results also show that doubling the concentration of mucus from 2% solids to 4% solids results in a 10\u2010fold increase in the viscosity of mucus. Further, the increases in mucus concentration results in an increase in the buffer capacity of mucus, making it more resistant to changes in pH. Taken together, our results show that pH alters the viscosity of low concentration mucus, but that effect is diminished at high mucus % solids. The data further show that % solids is ultimately the dominant factor in creating the highly viscous mucus that is a hallmark of CF airway disease.",

In this ongoing study, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples are being collected from pediatric patients at regular intervals over the first 6 years of life. The goal of our analysis is to investigate changes in the rheological properties of mucus brought on by CF airway disease. We have previously shown that CF sputum is characterized by significantly increased mucin concentration [1], resulting in modified biophysical properties such as viscoelasticity and osmotic pressure [2, 3]. Due to the dilute nature of BAL samples, determining the native concentration of mucus along the airways from BAL samples has proven impossible. While small flecks of concentrated, viscoelastic mucus are present in the pediatric CF BALs, the samples also contain highly diluted mucus that is rheologically identical to saline. By combining sophisticated microbead rheological measurements of BAL samples with advanced data analytics, we are able to determine a diversity of rheological microenvironments in which tracer particles are sampling. Specifically, we embed 1 micron diameter tracer particles into the sample volume and analyze their diffusive fluctuations. Analytically, we firstly determine which particle tracked paths are consistent with normal saline and exclude those from further analysis. For non\u2010excluded particles, anomalous sub\u2010diffusion parameters of each particle path are calculated [4], reflecting motilities from a range of diluted to pure mucus sample. We compare our results to adult CF and normal BALs, finding that the samples collected from the pediatric AREST participants display a rheology that lies between that of healthy adults and adult CF patients. We additionally compare the results of over 150,000 particle tracks from 64 patients and 12 non\u2010CF pediatric disease patients with traditional clinical biomarkers such as CT scan scoring and cell counts.",

In contrast, loss of CFTR in M\u03a6s causes a profound reduction of ezrin protein levels in the plasma membrane ruffles in response to LPS. In activated CF M\u03a6s, ezrin is trapped intracellularly and fails to be phosphorylated at its actin\u2010binding domain, thus leading to proteasome\u2010dependent degradation. Reduced ezrin is also observed in human CF M\u03a6s bearing Class I\u2010II (n=3) but not mild CFTR mutations (n=2). Studies in shRNA\u2010Ezr\u2010M\u03a6s reveal that ezrin is required for PI3K/AKT induction in response to LPS. Low levels of ezrin in M\u03a6s also augment TLR4 signaling in response to LPS, and impair Pseudomonas aeruginosa phagocytosis. Treatment with celecoxib, a nonsteroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drug that we have previously used to reestablish PI3K/AKT signaling in CF M\u03a6s challenged with LPS and to reduce lung hyperinflammation in CF mice, increases ezrin levels and promotes its phosphorylation in CF cells.

            "text": "Tracheal submucosal glands (SMGs) impact airway health by secreting mucus and serous fluids and by contributing to cellular regeneration as a tissue\u2010specific stem cell (SC) niche. It has been shown that CFTR defects lead to dysregulation in the SMG SC niche likely through altered gland secretions, but much is still unknown regarding how glandular SCs are regulated. Wnt signaling is required for lineage commitment of glandular SCs during SMG morphogenesis from the surface airway epithelium (SAE). Whether similar Wnt\u2010dependent processes coordinate SC expansion in adult SMGs following airway injury remains unknown. We found that two Wnt\u2010reporters in mice (BAT\u2010gal and TCF/Lef:H2B\u2010GFP) are co\u2010expressed in actively cycling SCs of primordial glandular placodes and in a small subset of adult SMG progenitor cells that enter the cell cycle 24 hours following airway injury. At homeostasis, these Wnt reporters showed nonoverlapping cellular patterns of expression in the SAE and SMGs. Following tracheal injury, proliferation was accompanied by dynamic changes in Wnt\u2010reporter activity and the analysis of 56 Wnt\u2010related signaling genes revealed unique temporal changes in expression within proximal (gland\u2010containing) and distal (gland\u2010free) portions of the trachea. For example, seven Wnt ligands (Wnt10a, Wnt10b, Wnt2, Wnt3a, Wnt4, Wnt5a, Wnt6) and six Wnt receptors (Fzd1, Fzd2, Fzd5, Fzd7, Lrp5, Lrp6) were differentially regulated. Additionally, Wnt modulators (Dkk2, Dkkl1, Sfrp1, Sfrp2, Bambi, Dvl1, Wif1) and downstream targets of Wnt signaling (Wisp2, Ccnd3, Myc) were also differentially expressed following injury. Wnt stimulation in vivo and in vitro promoted epithelial proliferation in both SMGs and the SAE. Interestingly, slowly cycling nucleotide label\u2010retaining cells (LRCs) of SMGs were spatially positioned near clusters of BAT\u2010gal positive serous tubules. Isolation and culture of tet\u2010inducible H2B\u2010GFP LRCs demonstrated that SMG LRCs were more proliferative than SAE LRCs and culture expanded SMG\u2010derived progenitor cells outcompeted SAE\u2010derived progenitors in regeneration of tracheal xenograft epithelium using a clonal analysis competition assay. SMG\u2010derived progenitors were also multipotent for cell types in the surface airway epithelium and formed gland\u2010like structures in xenografts. These studies demonstrate the importance of Wnt signals in modulating SC phenotypes within tracheal niches and provide new insight into phenotypic differences of SMG and SAE SCs. These studies also provide a foundation for the isolation and propagation of multipotent glandular progenitors that may be useful for SC therapies for CF airway disease.",

            "text": "\nPseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen causing infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Chronic CF airways are also characterized by robust neutrophilic infiltration. Neutrophils fight P. aeruginosa by multiple mechanisms: besides phagocytosis, they also release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to trap pathogens. NETs are composed of extracellular DNA decorated with histones and granule components. NETs are present in CF airways indicating that recruited neutrophils extrude NETs \u2010 most likely in response to bacteria including P. aeruginosa. Although clinically a potentially relevant mechanism in CF, the details of P. aeruginosa\u2010induced NET formation remain unclear. Previously, we have shown that laboratory standard strains and CF isolates of P. aeruginosa are all strong inducers of NET formation in human neutrophils in vitro. To identify which bacterial components are crucial for NET induction, we cultured P. aeruginosa for different lengths of time representing bacteria in their early or late exponential, or early stationary growth phases. Interestingly, P. aeruginosa in the early exponential growth phase triggered the most robust NET formation while bacteria from older cultures led to diminished NET release. This indicated that bacterial components/virulence factors characteristic in their early growth phase are mainly responsible for triggering NET formation. Aflagellated mutants of P. aeruginosa PAK and PAO1 were seriously impaired in triggering NETs. Purified flagellum or flagellin monomers failed to stimulate NET release in human neutrophils. TLR5\u2010blocking antibodies did not influence the ability of P. aeruginosa to trigger NET release. Similarly, murine neutrophils deficient in the main flagellin\u2010sensing receptors, TLR5 and NLRC4, release NETs in response to P. aeruginosa just as wild\u2010type neutrophils. The seemingly paradoxical finding of P. aeruginosa\u2010induced NET release being flagellum\u2010dependent but TLR5\u2010 and NLRC4\u2010independent could be explained by the requirement of flagellar motility. The main function of the flagellum is to provide the bacterium with the ability to swim. We tested flagellar motor\u2010deficient P. aeruginosa PAK mutants (DmotABD, DmotBCD) that express flagellum but are unable to move it for their ability to induce NETs in human neutrophils. Interestingly, we have found that motor\u2010deficient mutants were incapable of inducing NET formation. In summary, we identified the bacterial flagellum as the major component of P. aeruginosa to induce NETs. The flagellum does not stimulate NET formation by binding to flagellum\u2010sensing receptors but by providing swimming motility. We speculate that this mechanism could be also partially responsible for the well\u2010described loss of flagellum of P. aeruginosa during CF airway infections.",

SLC26A9 is an anion transporter/exchanger known to interact with CFTR. SLC6A14 encodes an amino acid transporter expressed in the intestine. Rs12710568 is in high LD with the top ranked SNP at the SLC6A14 locus and falls in the putative promoter for the gene. Analysis in the context of chromatin states, DNase hypersensitivity and transcription factor binding data enables us to narrow the SLC26A9 regional association to SNPs close to the transcription start site of SLC26A9 that may influence expression levels. PRSS1 encodes cationic trypsinogen, a protease from the pancreas, with elevated serum levels indicating CF in newborns. Given our PRSS1 regional association (rs9969188) and recently reported luciferase assays with a promoter variant in strong LD (rs4726576) associated with childhood\u2010onset pancreatitis, it appears that a decrease in PRSS1 levels may increase the risk for MI.

To evaluate the genetic architecture of SLC26A9, we sequenced the entire SLC26A9 locus (9.9 kb 5', 30.4 kb gene and 7.4 kb 3') in 762 F508del homozygotes. Two linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks defined by a single recombination in intron 8 were identified. Haplotypes were tested for association with CFRD onset using a continuous trait in which severity is reflected by earlier onset CFRD vs. older ages without CFRD diagnosis (Blackman, SM, et al.). Two common haplotypes (29.2% and 32.7% frequency) within the 5' LD block containing the variants identified by GWAS were associated with higher and lower risk of CFRD, respectively. No coding SNPs were in LD with either haplotype and no individual SNPs showed greater association with CFRD than the two common haplotypes.

PloS One. 2011;6:e24399; Kang MJ, et al. Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 2015;53:863\u201071). Studies have also shown that YKL\u201040 is inversely correlated with pulmonary function (Hector A et al.). Specific alteration in gene expression in diseases could be explained by the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in specific regions of the CHI3L1 gene (Thomsen SB, et al. PloS One. 2012;7:e47094). The purpose of this study was to determine if the presence of SNPs could change CHI3L1 gene expression and lead to higher levels of YKL\u201040 as well as a specific clinical profile in CF patients.",

With the implementation of the current Hologic 40+4 panel, infants in the state of IL with an IRT measurement in the top 4% of specimens for the day were screened for the D1270N variant. The D1270N variant was originally described as a mild mutation associated with congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) in men. However, further evaluations have introduced the possibility that this variant is more likely a benign polymorphism that is not disease\u2010causing in most individuals unless it is paired with other CF mutations on the same allele. Specifically, recent studies indicate a triple complex allele including the D1270N, R74W, and V201M variants may be responsible for the disease phenotype.",

Since the publication of the first CF mouse model in 1992, there have been at least 15 CF mouse models published and utilized by the CF research community to provide new understanding of CF and the ability to test therapeutic strategies in vivo. While all of these CF mouse models have proved useful, conventional gene targeting methods had deficiencies that included the use of selectable markers, affecting Cftr expression, and did not allow for gene targeting on a desired genetic background, leading to a lengthy process. In the last few years, a new gene editing system, CRISPR/Cas, has been utilized to create specific gene mutations faster and without the issues of conventional gene targeting. The aim of this study was to utilize the CRISPR/Cas system to make three common mutations in mouse Cftr to be utilized for in vivo studies by the CF research community.",

Unfortunately the CFTR deficient mouse does not develop spontaneous lung disease. There are two mouse models that result in a CF\u2010like lung disease due to upregulation of ENaC in airway epithelial cells (AEC). It has been hypothesized that ENaC hyperactivity leads to mucus dehydration and accumulation in CF patients. Increased ENaC levels in the lungs, (Mall M, et al. Nat Med. 2004;10:487\u2010493) and deletion of Nedd4L, the ubiquitin ligase which controls the levels of ENaC on the cell surface in airway epithelial cells (AECs), has been demonstrated to increase levels of ENaC expression which results in cystic fibrosis\u2010like disease (Kimura T, et al. PNAS. 2011;108;8:3216\u201021). The AEC specific knockout of Nedd4L results in ASL depletion, reduced mucus transport, goblet cell metaplasia and mucus accumulation, massive inflammation, fibrosis and death by 3 weeks of age.

            "text": "Cough clearance (CC) is an important airway defense mechanism which enhances the removal of accumulated mucus from our lungs. Clinical studies have revealed that CC is less effective in clearing mucus in people with CF, compared with healthy individuals. However, there is currently a gap in our knowledge of why CC is defective in CF, and what therapeutics can be used to increase CC. Our previous studies have demonstrated that in CF, dysregulation of ion transport (i.e. defective CFTR) leads to airway fluid depletion, mucin hyperconcentration, impaired mucociliary clearance (e.g. collapsed periciliary layer) and adhesion of the mucus to the airway surface layers. Furthermore, the properties of mucus are hypothesized to be heavily influenced by the two major gel forming mucins: MUC5B and MUC5AC. While non\u2010CF and healthy mucus is dominated by MUC5B, clinical studies have shown that MUC5AC expression is up\u2010regulated in CF patients during an acute exacerbation. Therefore, we hypothesized that CC is controlled largely by mucus concentration and is additionally dependent on the relative and absolute amount of MUC5AC. To study the effect of CF\u2010related concentration changes in mucus properties on cough clearance rates, we developed an in vitro cough machine which incorporates well\u2010differentiated human bronchial epithelial cultures within a custom chamber that we used to subject cultures to cough\u2010mimicking airflow velocities up to 35 meters per second. In these studies, we compared the effect of endogenous mucus over a range of mucus concentrations, spanning healthy to CF, as well as with exogenous mucus having different ratios of MUC5B to MUC5AC. The CC of mucus was captured by tracking the movement of particles embedded in the mucus layer with hi\u2010speed camera during 200 millisecond airflow pulses. Our results reveal that CC is critically dependent upon mucus concentration. We found that in healthy (non\u2010CF) mucus, cough produces substantially higher clearance rates of transport than cilia (800 vs. 60 \u03bcm/sec). However, our studies demonstrate that, like cilia\u2010mediated mucus clearance, the ability to clear mucus by cough is also significantly reduced when mucus becomes concentrated in CF. Our studies also showed that MUC5B\u2010dominated mucus is effectively cleared by cough, supporting the hypothesis that MUC5B is important for clearing mucus. However, CC was significantly reduced in MUC5AC\u2010dominated mucus at the same concentration. Finally, from a therapeutic prospective, we have used our novel devices to show that cough clearance can be accelerated by a combination of mucus hydrators (7% hypertonic saline) and reducing agents (DTT). Our results demonstrate the utility of our model system to robustly assay the parameters mediating CC in health, why it fails in disease, and the relative effects of MUC5B and MUC5AC. This work was supported by the CFFT Mucus Clearance Consortium.",

Previously, we showed F670del\u2010Yor1 (Yeast Oligomycin Resistance\u20101, a member of the ABC gene family) can serve as a useful model for genome\u2010wide analysis of modifiers that govern F508del\u2010CFTR biogenesis. The work demonstrated evolutionary conservation of gene\u2010gene interaction between yeast and human, and resulted in discovery of novel targets for improvement of F508del\u2010CFTR misfolding. yor1\u2010G704X results from a mutation in S. cerevisiae homologous to CFTR\u2010G542X, and thus can be used as a phenomic model to identify gene targets for promoting readthrough. We introduced yor1\u2010G704X into the full genomic collection of S. cerevisiae knockout and knockdown (YKO/KD) strains, and performed quantitative high throughput cell array phenotyping (Q\u2010HTCP) to measure growth on oligomycin as an endpoint for nonsense codon suppression. Parallel analysis of the yor1\u2010\u03940 mutant served as a control for effects of YKO\u2010KD mutation on oligomycin sensitivity. G418 (an aminoglycoside readthrough agent) increased oligomycin resistance in the context of Yor1\u2010G704X, but had no effect on the yor1\u2010\u03940 strain. Similarly, the Yor1\u2010G704X\u2010eGFP exhibited increased fluorescence when cultured with G418, supporting use of yor1\u2010G704X for genome\u2010wide screening. Analysis across the complete yeast deletion strain library in concert with Yor1\u2010G704X revealed participants in the nonsense mediated decay (NMD) pathway, NAM7 (UPF1) and UPF3, both of which are known targets for CFTR\u2010G542X readthrough. Overall, we discovered 250 candidate gene targets more potent than UPF3 deletion for inducing full length Yor1. All gene interactions tested thus far by a secondary assay for readthrough (based on Yor1\u2010G704X\u2010eGFP fluorescence) have validated the primary phenotypic results. Additional testing of \u201chits\u201d in combination with each other (epistasis analysis) is in progress. Also ongoing is use of the technology to establish a pharmacogenomics approach for determining genes responsible for effects of readthrough agents. Taken together, the studies describe a powerful new system with application to cystic fibrosis drug discovery.",

            "text": "In diseases, such as cystic fibrosis (CF), where normal water, salt, and mucus concentrations are abnormal, the normal mucus layer becomes dehydrated and compresses the periciliary gel layer, collapsing the cilia and preventing normal clearance. The properties of the flowing mucus layer are predicted to be heavily influenced by the two major gel\u2010forming mucins, MUC5B and MUC5AC. Data from cell culture, induced secretions, and animal models suggest that MUC5B forms the basis of the normal flowing gel. However, if the lung is \u201cirritated\u201d by allergies, pollutants, and/or infection, MUC5AC levels increase. We hypothesize that cilia\u2010dependent mucus flow and cough clearance are: (1) controlled by differing biophysical properties between the mucus layer and the underlying periciliary gel layer; (2) these differences in biophysical properties are controlled largely by mucus concentration; and (3) the biophysical properties of the mucus layer can be modified by the relative and absolute increase in MUC5AC. To provide a framework that will allow for direct comparison of the biophysical properties of MUC5B compared to MUC5AC, we have developed cells that are deficient in one or the other mucin. For this study we have utilized CRISPR\u2010Cas9\u2010mediated deletion of either MUC5AC or MUC5B to generate mono\u2010mucin\u2010producing A549 cells, which normally produce both mucins in nearly equal ratios. Results from Western blots, RT\u2010PCR, sequencing, and mass spectrometry from clonally selected A549 cells confirm mono\u2010mucin production, demonstrating the utility of CRISPR\u2010Cas9 genome editing for generating cell models lacking mucin proteins. Mucin collected from the apical washes of these clonally derived cell lines was collected and concentrated. The harvested mucus has been evaluated by a variety of biophysical techniques, including measurements of adhesive and cohesive strength, cough clearance, light scattering and mucociliary clearance. Light scattering demonstrated an approximate 50% reduction in MUC5B or MUC5AC mono\u2010mucin concentration compared to mucin\u2010sufficient cells, consistent with the concept that the mucus produced by A549 cells contains both MUC5AC and MUC5B at nearly equal proportions. A preliminary study evaluating mucus transport on ciliated airway cultures indicates that MUC5B\u2010deficient mucin transports less efficiently than MUC5AC\u2010deficient mucus. Results from these studies will help elucidate the complex relationships between mucus properties and mucin composition, which will ultimately help our understanding of mucus pathogenesis in CF.",

This method used a slow infusion rate (1 \u03bcl/min) of sequential Krebs buffers, with the flow\u2010rate limited largely by the ability of the animal to cope with the fluid volume delivered.

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) showed for inhaled antibiotics that concentrations were inversely related to the severity of structural changes as seen on chest CT\u2010scans.

Most importantly, the differential response to P. aeruginosa infection in CC lines was found to be greater than that reported in classical inbred mice.

The main features of CF lung disease are bacterial colonization and chronic infection in the conducting airways, which are thought to be due to alterations in the physical and chemical properties of the airway surface liquid (ASL). Pathological and clinical data suggest that the disease is initiated in distal small airways with a diameter <2mm. However, most studies regarding the pathogenesis of CF rely on data from excised or cultured proximal large airways, such as tracheal and bronchi tissue. Thus, there are no direct experimental data to support the dogma that CF lung disease is initiated in distal small airways. Our group has engineered pigs with either a deletion of or mutation of CFTR, which mimics human CF. CF pigs develop spontaneous airway infections, and airways become obstructed with mucus and inflammatory cells. This model provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the spatial origins of CF lung disease. We hypothesize that selective expression of CFTR in distal small airways in vivo prevents development of lung disease in CF pigs. Using a directed evolution strategy both in vitro and in vivo, we have identified a novel adeno\u2010associated virus vector (AAV2H22) with high tropism for both large and small airway epithelial cells. Based on previous studies indicating that small airways have higher surfactant protein D (SPD) expression as compared to large airways, we constructed AAV2H22 vectors to direct expression of eGFP or CFTR to small airway epithelia using a SPD promoter fragment (562bp). There are significantly more GFP+ cells in small airway cultures infected with AAV2H22SPD>eGFP, compared to large airway cultures. Administration of AAV2H22SPD>eGFP to both trachea and distal small airways in 1\u2010week\u2010old live pigs through bronchoscope confirmed that GFP+ cells were observed in distal small airways, but not in trachea or bronchi in vivo. In addition, there is significantly more cAMP\u2010stimulated short circuit current in CF small airway cultures infected with AAV2H22SPD>hCFTR\u0394R in vitro. Ultimately, these tools will allow us to test our hypothesis in future studies in vivo, which will enhance our understanding of CF lung disease pathogenesis.",

In this study, we investigated loss of male reproductive structures in the CF rat model, including epididymis and regional involution of the vas. Based on analysis of over 70 CFTR+/+ and \u2010/\u2010 male animals ranging from E15.5 to P8, these developmental abnormalities were shown to occur perinatally. Timed matings and histomorphometry were used to establish that CF embryonic Wolffian and Mullerian ducts develop normally until E17.5, after which both structures begin to degenerate. Regional atresia of the vas deferens at the time of birth (and immediately thereafter) was observed, with no indication of luminal mucus or other physical obstruction. Moreover, in contrast to parenchymal damage in human and porcine CF lung and pancreas, no indication of inflammatory cell infiltrate or increased myofibroblast differentiation (as judged by TGF\u03b21 and pSMAD2/3 signaling) were noted in association with involution of the vas. Interestingly, we found that epididymal defects such as diminished smooth muscle proliferation appear to predate loss of the vas deferens. In addition, RNAseq of tissue biopsied from the CF male rat reproductive tract suggests gross alteration of signaling and developmental pathways, including Wnt9b and homeobox\u2010like transcription factors Emx2 and Gata3 (loss of Wnt9b, Emx2, and Gata3 function has been associated previously with destruction of mesonephric duct derivatives in studies of knockout mice). Immunohistochemistry to determine the role of these pathways within the developing rat genitourinary tract, together with studies of androgen receptor signaling and TUNEL assays (to monitor epithelial apoptosis) are in progress. The findings provide an important test of fundamental mechanisms that underlie tissue damage in cystic fibrosis reproductive epithelia, with potential relevance to more generalized exocrine abnormalities in the disease.",

Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells represent a patient\u2010specific and renewable resource for derivation of tissues affected in CF to serve as a valuable platform for drug discovery and development. Here, we use iPS lines derived from a patient cohort harboring the rare CF\u2010causing mutation c.3700 A>G\u2010CFTR to model drug responses in engineered lung epithelium. This mutation is most prominent in Middle Eastern populations and causes aberrant splicing and deletion of six residues in the nucleotide\u2010binding domain 2 (\u0394I1234_R1239\u2010CFTR) leading to nearly undetectable protein and chloride channel activity. Chronic and acute exposure to VX\u2010809 (lumacaftor) and VX\u2010770 (ivacaftor) respectively \u2013 a condition mimicking the combined therapeutic OrkambiTM \u2010 significantly rescued the cell surface expression and activity of the \u0394I1234_R1239\u2010CFTR mutant in overexpression HEK cells as shown by Western blotting and a fluorescence\u2010based assay monitoring membrane potential (FLIPR). We validated the OrkambiTM effect in patient\u2010derived lung epithelium, a study requiring innovation given the inaccessibility of such tissue. iPS cells were generated from an affected individual bearing the c.3700 A>G\u2010CFTR and differentiated into lung epithelium using our published protocol (Wong AP, et al. Nat Protoc. 2015;10:363\u201081). Correction with VX\u2010809 and potentiation with VX\u2010770 led to modest but significant changes in apical, CFTR mediated chloride conduction as measured using FLIPR. Importantly, in a multiwell plate reader assay we ranked the response of this iPSC\u2010derived lung tissue to multimodulators pointing to the utility of this platform for developing personalized treatments for individuals with rare mutations. Future work will utilize CRISPR\u2010Cas9 edited isotypic controls to decipher a patient\u2010specific benchmark for maximum improvement upon correction of the CFTR locus.

Our laboratory participates in the CF theratyping initiative through development of epithelial cell models encoding clinically relevant mutations on a Fischer Rat Thyroid ((FRT)/Flp\u2010inTM) background. To date, we have established over 40 isogenic FRT CFTR2 cell lines expressing rare CF alleles from a single chromosomal insertion site\u2014as well as mechanistically important CFTRs intended to improve understanding of both missense and nonsense abnormalities. The FRT lines demonstrate similar levels of CFTR mRNA, and are profiled according to steady\u2010state core and fully glycosylated protein, vectoral ion transport, responsiveness to corrector molecules (VX\u2010809, VX\u2010661), potentiator (VX\u2010770) activity, and more specialized assays tailored to individual CF alleles. Insight from global analysis of CFTR2 mutants will be presented, including observations that: 1) distinct mutations (eg from CFTR classes I, II, and IV) are significantly stabilized by chronic treatment with corrector and potentiator molecules (VX\u2010809 and VX\u2010770), 2) numerous processing mutations (class II) show correction with VX\u2010809, suggesting a shared \u201coff\u2010pathway\u201d misfolding intermediate, 3) many gating defects (class III) are potentiated in a manner that correlates strongly with alleles clinically approved for treatment with Kalydeco, 4) conductance mutations (class IV) may exhibit minimal or no response to potentiator (VX\u2010770) therapy, although exceptions exist (eg R117H), and 5) a majority of CFTR mutations display molecular characteristics of more than one traditional subcategory, indicating importance of new methods for reclassifying CFTR2 alleles with a focus on theratype. These findings highlight the significance of cell\u2010based model systems for understanding CF disease pathogenesis, and directing therapeutic trials that will help advance \u201cprecision\u201d treatment for all individuals with the disease.

One of the major obstacles impeding the related research is that neutrophils isolated from CF patients are short\u2010lived ex vivo and nonpermissive to genetic manipulation. Taking advantage of the new CRISPR/Cas9 gene\u2010editing technology, we are establishing a \u0394F508\u2010CF neutrophil\u2010precursor cell line, from which unlimited CF neutrophils can be differentiated by dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) induction. A specific sgRNA target sequence on Exon 11 in the human CFTR gene, which covers the F508 site, was identified, synthesized and engineered into the S. pyogenes Cas9 plasmid pSpCas9(BB)\u20102A\u2010GFP (PX458). The resulting CFTR\u2010sgRNA\u2010Cas9 vector was verified by DNA sequencing. A 127\u2010bp single\u2010stranded DNA oligo was synthesized as the template for homology\u2010directed repair (HDR) for Cas9\u2010induced DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). This oligo, complementary to the nontarget strand of CFTR exon 11 and with 36\u2010bp of homology upstream and 91\u2010bp of homology downstream of the Cas9\u2010induced DSB site, has two modifications: 1) a 3\u2010bp deletion immediately downstream of the DSB site to create the \u0394F508 mutation, and 2) a silent C\u2192T point mutation to create an SspI restriction enzyme cut site 5\u2010bp upstream of the DSB site. To test the principle, HEK\u2010293T cells were transfected with the sgRNA\u2010Cas9 plasmid and the HDR template via calcium phosphate precipitation. Forty\u2010eight hours post\u2010transfection, the GFP\u2010positive cells were FACS\u2010sorted and single\u2010cell\u2010cloned by limited dilution. DNA PCR\u2010amplification of the cell clones, followed by SspI analytic digestion and DNA sequencing, confirmed that 1/31 (3.2%) clones had double\u2010allele HDR, and 4/31 (13%) clones had single\u2010allele HDR. To create a designed neutrophil precursor cell line, HL\u201060 cells were transfected with the CFTR\u2010sgRNA\u2010Cas9 vector plasmid along with the HDR template oligo via electroporation. Twenty\u2010four hours later, the GFP\u2010positive cells were FACS\u2010sorted and single\u2010cell cloned. The HL\u201060 cell clones are currently under expansion and will be analyzed similarly for HDR. We anticipate that a \u0394F508\u2010CF neutrophil precursor cell line will be established for CF research and drug screening. This work is supported by a CFFT research grant (WANG15XX0).",

Since nasal epithelium is much easier to sample than bronchial epithelium and provides a possibility of repeated isolation of cells from the same patient, an effort is concentrated on improvement of the HNE cultures. The general aim of the study was development of a physiologically relevant tool for the in vitro prediction of efficacy of a given compound in an individual patient. The primary measures were the characterization and comparison of the primary human nasal cells to commonly known bronchial epithelial cells, cultured in the same conditions, and tests of efficacy of CFTR correctors VX\u2010809 and VX\u2010661 in both cell models.",

The epithelia are typically plated on Snapwell polyester (polyethylene terephthalate) inserts. While evaluating culture conditions we found that epithelia plated on polycarbonate Snapwell inserts generated Phe508del CFTR short circuit currents that were about a factor of 2 greater compared to the same cells on polyester inserts. ENaC\u2010 and calcium\u2010activated current magnitudes were also affected as well as the composition of calcium activated currents. Corrector and potentiator responses were maintained and similar to responses obtained with polyester inserts. A similar change in insert type impacts the phenotypes of tracheal gland cells (2).

Serious AEs were reported in 4 pts, with 1 possibly related to study drug (elevated AST/ALT). AEs of special interest were observed in 11 pts: 7 (12.1%) with elevated AST/ALT and 4 (6.9%) with respiratory events (dyspnea, n=1; respiration abnormal, n=1; wheezing, n=2). Significant improvements were observed in CFQ\u2010R scores at wk 24 (LS mean change from baseline [95% CI], 5.4 [1.4, 9.4]; P=0.0085) and in sweat chloride, BMI, and LCI2.5 (Table).

Amplifiers are CFTR mutation agnostic and lead to increased levels of immature CFTR protein along with stabilization in CFTR mRNA allowing for more substrate for other CFTR modulators to act upon.

            "text": "CF is a lethal autosomal recessive disease in which the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is mutated. The most common mutation in CFTR, \u0394F508, results in 3 primary intracellular defects: inefficient folding in the ER, diminished chloride transport across the apical membrane, and increased lysosomal degradation. There is an FDA\u2010approved combination therapy that alleviates those defects: VX\u2010809 assists proper CFTR folding in the ER and VX\u2010770 enhances the ability of CFTR to efflux chloride at the apical membrane. Combinatorial treatment with VX\u2010809 and VX\u2010770, however, demonstrates modest effects (\u0394FEV1 = 3%) in homozygous \u0394F508 CF patients and no efficacy in heterozygous patients. Currently, no therapeutics are designed to stabilize CFTR. Rapid lysosomal degradation of mature CFTR is facilitated by the CFTR\u2010associated ligand (CAL), a negative regulator that binds the CFTR C\u2010terminus via a PDZ domain\u2010mediated interaction (Cheng J, et al. J Biol Chem. 2002;277:3520\u20109). To directly address CFTR instability, we engineered a series of synthetic peptide inhibitors of CAL (iCAL) that bind the CAL PDZ domain (CALP) with unprecedented selectivity (Vouilleme L, et al. Angew Chem Int Ed Engl. 2010;49:9912\u20106). These inhibitors significantly increase \u0394F508 CFTR abundance and conductance at the apical membrane. To determine if our therapeutic leads are amenable to nonproteinogenic amino acid substitutions, we substituted acetylated lysine residues at modulatory sites along iCAL without ablating its target affinity. We crystallized each peptide in complex with CALP and determined structure complexes at resolutions \u2264 1.55 \u00c5 (Amacher JF, et al. PLoS One. 2014;9:e103650). From these data, we hypothesized that the incorporation of complex, unnatural side\u2010chains in iCAL will enhance its affinity and selectivity towards CALP. We utilized high\u2010throughput in silico modeling to identify putative modifications that, when coupled to modulatory lysine residues, will enhance the affinity between our iCAL peptidomimetics and CALP. We performed fluorescence polarization competition assays to determine inhibition constants (KI) between CALP and each modified peptide. Among the peptides investigated, we observed a 2\u2010 to 3\u2010fold increase in affinity between CALP and iCAL (KI \u2248 20\u201030 \u03bcM) relative to the unmodified peptide, indicating a moderate\u2010to\u2010weak interaction. Furthermore, we subjected these peptidomimetics to crystallographic analysis to understand potential mechanisms by which these modifications enhance affinity towards CALP. These experiments demonstrate that the incorporation of synthetic side\u2010chain modifications at modulatory sites can enhance the binding affinity between CALP and iCAL. Extending this experimental workflow to other iCAL sites will greatly expand the chemical diversity available to explore in order to enhance the affinity and selectivity of our therapeutic leads. A selective, highly potent iCAL therapeutic, administered in conjunction with Orkambi, could attenuate mutant CFTR defects and augment treatment efficacy in a broader spectrum of CF patients.

This process is catalyzed by adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs), a family of enzymes that convert adenosines (A's) to inosines (I's) in various RNAs. I is structurally similar to guanosine (G) and an A\u2010to\u2010I change is interpreted as an A\u2010to\u2010G change by ribosomes and other biological processes. As a result of this mechanism, protein function may be altered, particularly if editing occurs within mRNA coding regions. In our lab, we have engineered a recombinant ADAR that guides the editing reaction to a specific adenosine of our choosing within an RNA. Using this site\u2010directed RNA editing (SDRE) strategy, we have attempted to correct the most common premature termination stop codons (PTCs) in CFTR in transiently transfected HEK293T cells.",

While many vector options have been evaluated, integrating vectors have the greatest potential to maintain stable expression over time without a requirement for repeated administration. In this study, functional in vivo CFTR channel activity was restored in the airways of CF pigs using two integrating vector options: 1) a lentiviral vector; and 2) a hybrid piggyBac/AAV vector. In freshly excised tracheal and bronchus tissues and cultured sinus cells, we observed a significant increase in transepithelial cAMP\u2010stimulated current, evidence of functional CFTR. In addition, we observed increases in tracheal airway surface liquid (ASL) pH and bacterial killing in CFTR vector\u2010treated animals. In cultured airway epithelial cells from treated pigs, we observed increased ASL pH and decreased mucus viscosity. A third vector system based on an integrating hybrid piggyBac/adenoviral vector is currently being evaluated. Lentiviral vectors are a vetted option for CF gene therapy; whereas, the emerging technologies of DNA transposon\u2010based hybrid vectors provide new tools for in vivo gene transfer and present an exciting opportunity to increase the delivery efficiency for therapeutic genes such as CFTR. Our results demonstrate that CFTR delivery using integrating viral vectors can partially correct the anion channel defect in a large animal CF model and validate a translational strategy to treat or prevent CF lung disease.",

Airway disease is the major source of morbidity and mortality. Successful implementation of gene\u2010 and cell\u2010based therapies for cystic fibrosis (CF) airway disease requires knowledge of relationships between percentages of targeted cells, levels of CFTR expression, correction of electrolyte transport, and rescue of host defense defects. Previous studies suggested that when \u02dc20\u201050% of airway epithelial cells expressed CFTR, they generated wild\u2010type levels of Cl\u2010 secretion, and overexpressing CFTR offered no advantage compared to endogenous expression levels. However, recent discoveries focused attention on CFTR\u2010mediated HCO3\n\u2010 secretion and airway surface liquid (ASL) pH as critical for host defense and CF pathogenesis. Therefore, we generated porcine airway epithelia with varying ratios of CF and wild\u2010type cells. Epithelia with a 50:50 mix secreted HCO3\n\u2010 at half the rate of wild\u2010type epithelia. Likewise, heterozygous epithelia (CFTR\n+/\u2010 or CFTR\n+/\n\u0394F508) expressed CFTR and secreted HCO3\n\u2010 at \u02dc50% of wild\u2010type values. ASL pH, antimicrobial activity, and viscosity showed similar relationships to the amount of CFTR. Overexpressing CFTR increased HCO3\n\u2010 secretion to rates greater than wild\u2010type, but ASL pH did not exceed wild\u2010type values. Thus, in contrast to Cl\u2010 secretion, the amount of CFTR is rate\u2010limiting for HCO3\n\u2010 secretion and for correcting host defense defects. In addition, overexpressing CFTR might produce a greater benefit than expressing CFTR at wild\u2010type levels when targeting small fractions of cells. These findings may also explain the risk of airway disease in CF carriers.",

Recent data suggest that IL\u201017 contributes to pathological inflammation in the setting of abnormal mucosal immunity, and type\u201017 immunity driven inflammatory responses may represent a novel target to block aberrant inflammation in CF. Indeed, our transcriptomic analysis by RNA\u2010seq on the airway epithelium from CF patients who underwent clinical bronchoscopy revealed a dramatic upregulation of IL\u201017 downstream signature genes, implicating a significant contribution of IL\u201017 mediated immunity in CF lungs. Bromodomain and extra\u2010terminal domain (BET) chromatin modulators can regulate T cell responses, specifically Th17 mediated inflammation, by mechanisms that include bromodomain\u2010dependent inhibition of acetylated histones at the IL17 locus. Here we show that, in vitro, BET inhibition potently suppressed Th17 cell responses in explanted CF tissue and inhibited IL\u201017 driven chemokine production in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBE) cells. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aspergillus fumigatus lung infection murine models, BET inhibition decreased inflammation without exacerbating bacterial or fungal infection, suggesting that BET inhibition may be an effective and safe therapeutic approach in treating lung inflammation in CF patients.",

An increased understanding of this regional variation may aid in the discovery of interventions that will slow the progression of lung disease (Hogan DA, et al. PLoS One. 2016;11:e0149998). MicroRNAs are ubiquitous regulators of human biology. Much optimism exists for microRNAs as biomarkers in cancer and lung disease (Vencken SF, et al. Thorax. 2015;70:501\u20103.) Recent clinical and cell\u2010based studies have revealed CF\u2010specific alterations in miRNA expression, hence it follows that modulating miRNA expression in vivo looks very appealing for developing new CF therapies. The possibility that miRNAs may act as phenotype modifiers and that they could be used as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers warrants investigation (Noel S, Leal T. 2015. In: Cystic Fibrosis in the Light of New Research).

Of the top 100 microRNAs expressed, fourteen miRNAs were differentially expressed RLL vs RUL including: miR\u2010361\u20105p, miR\u2010378g, miR\u2010423\u20105p (up in RLL and down in RUL), and miR\u2010107, miR\u2010511\u20105p, miR\u201099a\u20105p (down in RLL and up in RUL). Interestingly, expression of five microRNAs was elevated in only the RLL in response to hypoxia: miR\u201022\u20103p, miR\u201030a\u20105p, miR\u201030e\u20105p, miR\u2010155\u20105p and miR\u20101246 but demonstrated static expression in the RUL upon oxygen challenge. All of these miRNAs were readily detectable in CF LM\u03c6, however their comparative expression and functional significance remains to be determined.",

The majority of studies in gut inflammation have utilized stool calprotectin as a biomarker of inflammation, with numerous studies reporting significant elevations in stool calprotectin compared to healthy controls. Stool calprotectin levels have been reported to correlate with growth and quality of life questionnaire scores. Ivacaftor is a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) potentiator that has been shown to improve lung function and reduce pulmonary exacerbations. Ivacaftor has also been associated with considerable weight gain, which may not be solely explained by improved pulmonary status. An improvement in gastrointestinal physiology has been speculated as an alternative explanation. Normalization of intestinal pH and histopathology have been observed while on ivacaftor but its effects on intestinal inflammation have not been fully established. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine whether ivacaftor reduces intestinal inflammation in patients with CF.",

Mouse models of CF were generated by overexpression of ENaC (Mall M, et al.

In Western blot studies, 24\u2010hour treatment with 3 \u03bcM VX\u2010661 either alone or in combination with 100 nM ivacaftor improved the cellular processing and trafficking of F508del\u2010CFTR as determined by an increase in the mature glycosylated CFTR. In Ussing chamber studies using F508del/F508del\u2010HBE cells derived from six donors, 24\u2010hour treatment with VX\u2010661 alone enhanced chloride transport from a baseline of 2.5% to 8.1% of normal levels with a half\u2010maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 516 \u00b1 42 nM. Co\u2010treatment (24 hours) with 0.1 \u03bcM ivacaftor and 3 \u03bcM VX\u2010661 further enhanced chloride transport to 15.7% of non\u2010CF airway cells. A minimal response to ivacaftor monotherapy was observed, which is consistent with little\u2010to\u2010no F508del\u2010CFTR at the cell surface in the absence of VX\u2010661. 72\u2010hour treatment of cultured F508del/F508del\u2010HBE cells with 3 \u03bcM VX\u2010661 and 0.1 \u03bcM ivacaftor also increased fluid transport and ciliary beat frequency to levels greater than those observed with either agent alone. These in vitro data demonstrate that the combination of VX\u2010661 and ivacaftor provides improvement of chloride transport, fluid transport, and ciliary beat frequency in F508del/F508del\u2010HBE cells. This combination was also explored in a panel of cells expressing different mutant CFTR forms, including mutant CFTR forms associated with severe or moderate defects in processing and trafficking, defects in channel gating activity or residual chloride transport. Overall, these in vitro data demonstrated that the combination of VX\u2010661 and ivacaftor improved chloride transport more than either agent alone in cells expressing a wide range of mutant CFTR forms. VX\u2010661 has a favorable preclinical pharmacokinetic profile with low clearance, high oral bioavailability, and good distribution into target tissues.

Unfortunately, we are severely limited in the tools available to safely evaluate the youngest patients, hampering our clinical ability to intervene on these patients and prevent irreversible damage.

Digital chest tomosynthesis (DCT) is a commercially available imaging technique that reconstructs image slices from an acquisition of a series of projection images into a pseudo\u20103D image. The in\u2010plane resolution of DCT can be higher than that of CT, at a significantly lower radiation dose. Scan times, unfortunately, are 5 to 15 seconds, well beyond the normal respiratory cycle of a young patient. We have developed a stationary digital chest tomosynthesis system (s\u2010DCT), which utilizes a stationary gantry with multiple, independently activated x\u2010ray focal spots based on carbon nanotube (CNT) x\u2010ray technology.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common and particularly virulent pathogen that can cause a significant level of morbidity and mortality. Intracellular bacterial colonization of P. aeruginosa in macrophages, mast cells or epithelial cells is particularly difficult to eradicate with antibiotics, even with those that are cell\u2010permeable. Autophagy is a catabolic process that cells use to degrade various defective proteins/foreign pathogens and convert them into useful cellular building blocks such as amino acids and lipids. In CF, it is known that autophagy is impaired and this can further compromise the patient's ability to clear the chronic lung infection. Autophagy activation enables an alternative mechanism to clear the bacterial infection out of cells; and therefore, could potentially be useful when used in combination with anti\u2010infective agents. The fatty acid cysteamine conjugate CAT\u20105571 is a new chemical entity that can activate autophagy in cultured primary homozygous F508del human bronchial epithelial (hBE) cells at concentrations as low as 0.3 \u03bcM. In an in vitro study involving hBE cells that had been infected with P. aeruginosa, a significant reduction in the intracellular bacterial load was observed when cells were pretreated with CAT\u20105571. The reduction in the CFU was comparable to that observed when similarly infected hBE cells were treated with cytochalasin D, a cell\u2010permeable antibiotic. The bacterial clearance was demonstrated first in an in vivo study using female BALB/c mice that were dosed orally with CAT\u20105571 for 3.5 days prior to infection with a lethal challenge of P. aeruginosa. CAT\u20105571 was then evaluated in a chronic P. aeruginosa infection model involving gut\u2010corrected CF F508del/F508del mice. In this in vivo model of CF lung infection and inflammation, treatment with CAT\u20105571 resulted in a decrease in bacterial load (82506 \u00b1 36048 without drug to 1657 \u00b1 1406 with drug, n = 7). Although there was no difference in the total white blood cell count in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, there was a shift away from neutrophils (26.44 \u00b1 10 versus 8 \u00b1 3, n \u2265 6) and increased number of macrophages (71 \u00b1 29 versus 89 \u00b1 9, n \u2265 6) all parameters p<0.05, using the analysis of variance between vehicle and CAT\u20105571 treated animals.

CF is associated with exaggerated and prolonged inflammation in the lungs, which contributes to lung injury, fibrosis and loss of lung function. When pulmonary infection is apparent in the CF airways, the adaptive and innate immune response is disproportionate and dysregulated. Even in the absence of clinically apparent infection there is often evidence of inflammation in the CF airways. CF patients show elevated levels of neutrophils in the lung, which have increased neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase activity. CF macrophages display spontaneous and exaggerated pulmonary infiltration, and are polarized into the M1 pro\u2010inflammatory phenotype and to a lesser extent into the M2 anti\u2010inflammatory phenotype. Cells of the adaptive immune system, such as T lymphocytes are more abundant in CF airways and produce high levels of inflammatory cytokines. Additionally an imbalance of T lymphocyte subsets may have an important role in the CF inflammatory response. Therapeutic regimens for CF generally involve management of symptoms in an attempt to slow the progression of the disease. However, it is the repeated cycles of inflammation, injury and fibrosis that cause the chronic, life\u2010threatening manifestations that ultimately lead to respiratory failure. Thus, therapies that can target this inflammatory environment and disrupt the destructive cycle of infection, inflammation and fibrosis would have a major impact in preventing the progression of lung disease. Perinatal stem cells have anti\u2010inflammatory properties that make them a promising cell therapeutic approach for treating CF.",

MMP9 is a member of zinc\u2010dependent endopeptidase that degrades extracellular matrix (ECM) during inflammation and wound healing. Increased levels of MMP9 have been observed in the sputa of CF subjects and is considered an important mediator in the pathogenesis of CF. Inhibition of MMP9 activity by GS\u20105745 thus has the potential to be beneficial for CF subjects. Multiple proteases, including HNE, are reported to be elevated in CF sputa and can digest IgG1.

Changes in health demographics and treatment thresholds since publication of the Fuchs definition, and changes in the demographics of patients volunteering for CF clinical trials, have resulted in an overall reduction in use of IV antibiotic treatments for exacerbations in clinical trials. Both the expanded and modified Fuchs exacerbation definitions have been developed in response to these changes. The expanded definition differs from the original in that any oral, inhaled, and/or IV antibiotics may be used in response to the presence of \u22654 signs and symptoms, and the modified Fuchs definition requires only the presence of \u22654 Fuchs signs and symptoms, irrespective of treatment. Although these three definitions have been employed in various studies, they are seldom, if ever, compared within a single study.

In terms of stability, following overnight incubation both NE Ultra and MeOSuc\u2010AAPV\u2010CH2Cl displayed inhibitory action against NE, however, MeOSuc\u2010AAPV\u2010CH2Cl showed a slight reduction in potency suggesting a lower stability in biological samples.

CF is characterized by hyper\u2010secretion of proinflammatory chemokines into the airway lumen. Consequently this induces the highly inflammatory cellular phenotype typical of CF, and subsequent fibrosis causing airway destruction, leading to morbidity and mortality. We have previously reported that miR\u2010155 is up\u2010regulated in cystic fibrosis lung epithelial cells. However, the molecular mechanism by which miR\u2010155 regulates the manifestations of the disease phenotype of CF is not well understood. Here we report that the regulatory associated protein of mTOR, complex 1 (RPTOR) is a novel target of miR\u2010155 in CF lung epithelial cells. The suppression of RPTOR expression and subsequent activation of TGF\u2010\u03b2 signaling resulted in the induction of fibrosis by up\u2010regulation of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in CF lung epithelial cells. Thus, we propose that miR\u2010155 can regulate fibrosis of CF lungs through the RPTOR\u2010TGF\u03b2\u2010CTGF axis. These mechanisms are potential targets for CF therapy.",

Experimentally, ASL depletion and mucus hyperconcentration have been generated in Scnn1b\u2010transgenic (Scnn1b\u2010Tg) mice by airway\u2010targeted overexpression of the epithelial Na+ channel \u03b2 subunit (\u03b2ENaC, encoded by the Scnn1b gene). Expression of the Scnn1b transgene causes airway surface dehydration with a consequent increase in mucus concentration, which leads to osmotic compression of cilia and mucus adhesion. Lung pathology in Scnn1b\u2010Tg mice is characterized by airway mucus obstruction, inflammation, and susceptibility to spontaneous bacterial infections, recapitulating the main features of CF lung disease. The importance of hyperconcentrated mucus in the pathophysiology of CF lung disease led us to use the Scnn1b\u2010Tg mouse as an in vivo model to test the efficacy of various mucus\u2010mobilizing agents. Our efforts have focused on the action of reducing agents, based on the rationale that reducing the molecular weight (MW) of mucin polymers by cutting intermolecular disulphide\u2010bonds is predicted to: 1) reduce the viscous and elastic moduli of mucus gels, and 2) increase the ability of mucins to diffuse out of swelling gels, thus aiding transport of mucus plugs out of the lung.",

Analysis of aerosol deposition fraction using 200 nm fluorescent latex beads indicated that less than 0.05% of the total number of beads in the generator were deposited in the lung of wild\u2010type (WT, C57BL/6N) mice. Nonetheless, agarose Western blot analysis of BAL harvested from Scnn1b\u2010Tg or WT mice after aerosolization of a single dose of a proprietary reducing agent (Rx) indicated a significant decrease (\u02dc50%) in high MW Muc5b polymers, as compared to mice aerosolized with iso\u2010osmotic vehicle. As mucus plugs in Scnn1b\u2010Tg mice airway are easily detectable histologically, the effect of Rx treatment was also assessed morphometrically (intraluminal AB\u2010PAS positive area). We demonstrated the feasibility of this approach in studies involving aerosolization of Rx to Scnn1b\u2010Tg mice, where we observed a dose\u2010dependent reduction in the lung mucus content (i.e., vehicle 0.188 \u00b1 0.025 mm2/lung n=21; \u02dc5 mM deposited Rx 0.162 \u00b1 0.023 mm2/lung n=8; \u02dc10 mM deposited Rx 0.059 \u00b1 0.012 mm2/lung n=9 mean \u00b1 SEM). Notably, preliminary experiments testing the efficacy of the benchmark mucolytic N\u2010acetylcysteine (NAC) suggest that this compound, dosed at the same concentration as active Rx (10 mM), is ineffective at promoting mucus plug clearance in Scnn1b\u2010Tg mice, mirroring poor efficacy of NAC in the clinic. Cumulatively, these data indicate that we have developed a clinically relevant platform to perform initial testing for efficacy/toxicity of mucus\u2010mobilizing agents.",

CF is a genetic disorder that affects mostly the lungs but also the pancreas, liver, kidneys and intestine. Long\u2010term issues include difficulty in breathing and coughing up sputum, resulting in extracellular DNA accumulation in the sputum and frequent lung infections. Patients exhibit lung disease consistent with failure of the innate airway defense mechanisms. Mucus represents the main barrier between the airway epithelium and the external environment and is, thus, the primary defense mechanism of the airways. Airway mucus dehydration seems paramount in the initiation of CF lung disease. Pulmonary disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in CF patients. Recombinant human DNase I enzymatically cleaves extracellular DNA in the sputa of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, hence, reducing sputum viscoelasticity that accumulates in the lungs of these patients, thus enabling better sputum expectoration. Actin, a potent inhibitor of DNase I activity, is found in high concentration in CF patients' sputum and may decrease the enzyme's DNA degradation activity therefore interfering with the effectiveness of inhaled DNase I in the lungs of CF patients. Protalix has developed a chemically modified plant cell\u2010expressed Actin\u2010Inhibition\u2010Resistant DNase I, or AIR\u2010DNase, to be administered by inhalation.

Pooling of BAL offers the opportunity to gather a homogenous sample of greater volume with a greater representation of the proximal airway component.

Of the 42 instances where culture results differed, in 8 cases (3.4%) this represented a known pathogen (4 cases where it grew in first lavage alone, and 4 in the pooled lavage alone). ROC curves demonstrated similar efficacy of pooling and first lavage as diagnostic tools for detection of known pathogens. Bland Altman analysis demonstrated strong agreement between the two methods in terms of detection of inflammation when infection was present.

As the effects of SPLUNC\u20101 are attenuated at acidic pH, the protein fails to negatively regulate ENaC in the CF lung. Previous work has identified an 18\u2010amino acid residue (S18) of the SPLUNC\u20101 N\u2010terminus that demonstrates regulation of ENaC.

We previously showed that the novel and unique biopolymer poly (acetyl, arginyl) glucosamine (PAAG15A), a polycationic polysaccharide that inter\u2010digitates with human mucus and interacts with purified mucin to normalize their structure, decreased the viscosity, elasticity, and adhesivity of CF airway mucus, substantially improving mucociliary transport. We have also shown that a related polymer, PAAG11D, prevented the incidence of DIOS in CFTR\u2010/\u2010 mice, significantly improving survival and growth. We have turned to the CFTR\u2010/\u2010 rat to investigate whether PAAG11D can prevent the development of DIOS and also treat documented obstruction.

Translation of PTC\u2010harboring mRNAs generates truncated proteins that are unstable and/or lack normal function. Drugs have been identified that suppress translation termination at a PTC to restore full\u2010length protein (also referred to as readthrough of the PTC). A subset of aminoglycosides has been shown to induce PTC readthrough, but the amount of full\u2010length protein generated by these drugs has not been sufficient to correct the phenotype of many diseases, including cystic fibrosis (CF). Furthermore, aminoglycoside toxicity limits their long\u2010term clinical use. In addition, PTCs also frequently elicit nonsense\u2010mediated mRNA decay (NMD). NMD is a conserved mRNA surveillance pathway that preferentially degrades PTC\u2010containing mRNAs, thereby diminishing the pool of mRNAs available for translation and PTC readthrough. Most current compounds induce PTC suppression or mediate NMD inhibition alone, although a few have the capacity to mediate both responses to some extent. The goal of this study is to develop a reporter system that will allow us to systematically identify new compounds with the ability to simultaneously induce PTC suppression and reduce NMD, which would provide the optimal therapeutic potential for CF patients.",

The response of these reporters to PTC suppression and NMD inhibition was tested by the treatment of cells with a variety of PTC suppressors and NMD inhibitors both individually and together. Our results show that NMD inhibition alone increased the NanoLuc luciferase activity and the mRNA abundance expressed from the dual RT/NMD reporter by 1.5\u20104 fold. Treatment with a variety of readthrough drugs increased NanoLuc activity 2\u201050 fold. Importantly, the combination of NMD inhibitors and readthrough drugs increased NanoLuc activity by as much as 700\u2010fold (depending on the PTC context and the cell line). The synergistic effect of combining NMD inhibition with readthrough observed with the dual RT/NMD reporter was not seen in the NMD\u2010only and RT\u2010only controls. These results demonstrate that this new NanoLuc luciferase\u2010based RT/NMD reporter system can be used to simultaneously monitor both NMD inhibition and PTC suppression.

In CF, these homeostatic mechanisms are impaired, leading to a dehydrated and acidic ASL. ASL volume depletion in CF is secondary to defective anion transport by CFTR. Abnormal CFTR\u2010mediated bicarbonate transport creates an unfavorable, acidic environment, which impairs antimicrobial function and alters mucus properties and clearance. These disease mechanisms create a disordered airway milieu, consisting of thick mucopurulent secretions and chronic bacterial infection. We previously reported that aerosol brevenal, a natural product produced by the dinoflagellate, Karenia brevis, augments whole\u2010lung mucociliary clearance and its surrogate marker, tracheal mucus velocity (TMV), when nebulized to sheep with diminished CFTR activity due to aerosol challenge with CFTRinh\u2010172 or CFTRinh\u2010172 with human neutrophil elastase. Brevenal is a potent voltage\u2010sensitive sodium channel (VSSC) inhibitor (10\u20108), not yet known to be expressed in epithelial cells. Brevenal does not affect ENaC or CFTR, suggesting it may alter the function of other ion transporters to affect ASL depth and augment mucus clearance. Here, we used one\u2010micron resolution optical coherence tomography (\u03bcOCT) to examine the effect of brevenal on ASL depth in CF primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells homozygous for F508del. At 24 hours, brevenal\u2010treated (1 \u03bcM, basolateral) cells exhibited significantly higher ASL depth (11.02 \u00b1 1.3, P<0.001) vs vehicle control (7.66 \u00b1 0.6), and compared favorably to treatment with positive control (9.30 \u00b1 0.3) corrector\u2010potentiator therapy (lumacaftor (VX\u2010809, 3 \u03bcM) and ivacaftor (VX\u2010770, 10 \u03bcM)). Augmented ASL depth was not observed at 6 hours, reflecting the kinetics of this pathway. Compared to baseline, the change in ASL depth at 24 hours with brevenal treatment was 4.00 \u00b1 1.2 (P<0.05) vs 1.62 \u00b1 0.7 (P=NS) with vehicle control and 3.54 \u00b1 0.4 (P<0.001) with lumacaftor\u2010ivacaftor. Brevenal had no effect on ciliary beat frequency (\u20100.17 \u00b1 0.3 Hz) after 24 hours. Analysis of changes in mucociliary transport are in progress. Overall, these results indicate that brevenal augments ASL depth without altering ciliary beating in F508del primary HBE monolayers, and is active even when added to the basolateral compartment. This partially explains how brevenal augmented mucociliary transport in sheep, and suggests the need for further mechanistic studies to determine its molecular target. If confirmed, VSSC inhibitors may be a therapeutic target to augment ASL depth in CF. Brevenal may be beneficial as an adjuvant therapy to improve ASL depth and mucociliary clearance in CF patients.",

Airway mucins are unusually cysteine (Cys)\u2010rich and show increased intra\u2010 and inter\u2010molecular disulfide bonding under oxidizing conditions. However, systemic or inhaled mucolytic agents such as N\u2010acetyl Cys are general reductants that exhibit poor clinical efficacy, as well as off\u2010target toxicity and low tolerability. Replacement with more potent and disulfide\u2010specific enzymatic reductants has the potential to create pharmacologically superior drugs. Human thioredoxin\u20101 (Txn) is a highly selective disulfide bond\u2010reducing enzyme normally secreted into the airway with strong activity on CF sputum viscoelasticity at micromolar concentrations. To optimize Txn as an inhaled agent, we engineered a nonsystemic thiol\u2010trapping variant (ORP\u2010100S, Theradux\u2122) to enable stable, covalent linkage to mucin disulfide bonds. Theradux and native Txn both have unusually low Cys thiol pKa (6.3), thus increasing disulfide\u2010reducing activity several 1000\u2010fold vs classical thiol agents (pKa 8.7 \u2013 9.5), which are largely inactive in vivo in the neutral\u2010to\u2010acidic CF airway. Previously, we demonstrated that Theradux 1) does not induce inflammation in rats on aerosol inhalation in vivo or in human cells in vitro, and 2) normalizes the viscoelasticity of expectorated human CF sputum to a greater degree than native Txn or other thiol agents. We therefore hypothesized that Theradux will improve mucus transportability. To evaluate this, we used primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) monolayers to examine mucus transportability in situ following 3\u2010h treatment with Theradux (1 mM) vs DTT (1.6 mM) and PBS control via one\u2010micron resolution optical coherence tomography (\u03bcOCT). Theradux\u2010treated cells exhibited increased mucociliary transport (2.18 \u00b1 0.3 mm/min, P<0.01) vs PBS (0.05 \u00b1 0.007 mm/min) that exceeded the effect of DTT (1.41 \u00b1 0.1 mm/min). Ciliary beating also was increased with Theradux treatment (13.87 \u00b1 0.4 Hz, P=0.06), as observed with DTT (16.17 \u00b1 0.8 Hz) but not vehicle control (10.62 \u00b1 1.1 Hz). Both viscous and elastic moduli of CF HBE mucus were reduced following treatment ex vivo with 1 mM Theradux, and analysis of changes in viscosity in situ are in progress. These results indicate that reducing disulfide bonds by Theradux increases mucus transportability, and suggest that Theradux may be a potential CF treatment by acting as an efficacious modifier of excess mucin viscoelasticity while optimized for activity across a broad airway pH microenvironment.",

Based on expression protocols using isogenic Flp\u2010In\u2122\u2010derived Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) cells, W1282X (truncated) protein levels were markedly diminished compared to wild\u2010type, and partially rescued by chronic treatment with VX\u2010770 and VX\u2010809. Prolonged incubation with G418 accentuated increases in both W1282X mRNA and protein, in a fashion unrelated to translational readthrough. In addition, W1282X protein could be increased with proteasome inhibitors ALLN or MG132, demonstrating importance of proteasomal degradation of the truncated mutant. In order to determine amounts of W1282X CFTR at the cell surface under various conditions, a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) tag was inserted on an externally directed segment of W1282X CFTR. Cell\u2010based chemiluminescence and FACS were then performed to monitor surface expression of CFTR\u2010HRP following exposure to correctors and/or potentiators. Chronic treatment with VX\u2010809 marginally increased the HRP signal. However, combined treatment with VX\u2010809 and VX\u2010770 resulted in marked enhancement of HRP by 30\u2010 or 27\u2010fold in the presence or absence of G418, respectively. Flow cytometry supported these findings, indicating that CFTR W1282X\u2010HRP traffics minimally to the cell surface, but can be augmented when CFTR modulators are given in combination. We and others have reported previously that W1282X CFTR maintains low level residual function as an ion channel. Ussing chamber studies demonstrate that treatment with either VX\u2010770 or VX\u2010809 acutely induces activation. We also show that W1282X CFTR exhibits a significant channel gating defect, and activity in the membrane patch can be substantially increased by VX\u2010770 or curcumin. Taken together, our results suggest that CFTR truncated at position 1282 leads to protein that is poorly functional. We speculate that absence of the carboxy terminal PDZ domain and/or portions of NBD2 that participate in domain swapping may confer defects in overall stability. Small molecules developed to address the W1282X mutation may therefore be required to: 1) improve mRNA stability, 2) enhance protein maturation, and 3) overcome abnormal channel gating. This is in addition to promoting readthrough of the nonsense codon. In summary, our evaluation provides a framework for drug discovery relevant to W1282X and other prematurely truncated CFTRs.

Tandem mass spectrometry (MS\u2010MS) revealed that leucine (58%), cysteine (38%) and tryptophan (4%) are inserted in the CFTR\u2010W1282X context following UGA suppression. Interestingly, these amino acids and their proportions are significantly different from those identified following suppression of the CFTR\u2010G542X UGA mutation, which are cysteine (44%), tryptophan (36%) and arginine (20%). These results demonstrate for the first time that the local sequence context plays a key role in determining the amino acids inserted during PTC suppression (and their relative proportions). We found that some of the variants generated by suppression exhibit reduced CFTR maturation and activity compared to wild\u2010type CFTR. Both a CFTR corrector (VX\u2010809) and potentiator (VX\u2010770) enhanced activity of many of the variants induced by G418\u2010mediated suppression.

These episodes indicate either acquisition of new bacterial infection or a change in the density of previously colonizing bacteria. PEx are poorly defined and difficult to diagnose in the setting of chronic inflammation. Currently, there is no biochemical test to diagnose CF pulmonary exacerbations and no consensus diagnostic criteria for what constitutes an exacerbation. Neutrophil CD64 expression is highly specific to acute infection, even on a background of chronic inflammation, and is diagnostic of acute bacterial infection in subjects with sepsis and rheumatoid arthritis. We hypothesized that a quantitative flow cytometry assay to measure CD64 expression directly off circulating CF neutrophils could sensitively predict acute exacerbations and reflect neutrophil phagocytic activity at the time of acute exacerbation.",

In cystic fibrosis (CF), airway hyper\u2010responsiveness has been frequently reported and suggests that an altered ASM physiology may contribute to CF airway disease. We have previously shown that the newborn CFTR\u2010/\u2010 pig displays ASM abnormalities prior to the onset of inflammation or infection including increased basal tone, increased bronchodilator response, and decreased calcium reuptake. The goals of this study were to: 1) identify whole genome transcriptional and proteomic changes in porcine CF ASM prior to airway inflammation and infection, 2) investigate whether specific pathways are associated with CF airway reactivity, and 3) determine if the CF pig ASM transcriptome can be used to identify potential ASM therapeutics for CF and other airway narrowing diseases. Total RNA sequencing of newborn non\u2010CF and CF ASM revealed differential and significant changes in muscle contraction related genes, ontologies, and pathways. High\u2010throughput ELISA protein comparisons between non\u2010CF and CF ASM cells revealed complementary pathway dysregulation. The genomic and proteomic signatures were used to perform pathway analysis. Large\u2010scale changes in transcript, protein abundance, and phosphorylation status were significantly different in PI3K/AKT and MAPK controlled pathways in CF samples. PYK2, a calcium\u2010sensitive tyrosine kinase known to be an upstream regulator of both PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways, showed increased phosphorylation status suggesting increased activity. We then used a small molecule inhibitor of PYK2 to test whether blocking PYK2 activation could alter airway contractility. Wild\u2010type precision cut lung slices pretreated with the kinase inhibitor demonstrated decreased airway narrowing in response to cholinergic stimulation compared to DMSO controls. Additionally, pretreatment with the compound in isolated wild\u2010type smooth muscle strips diminished force production and decreased myosin light chain phosphorylation. These studies show that loss of CFTR in ASM causes genome\u2010wide transcriptional and proteomic changes, including expected alterations in muscle contraction transcripts and proteins. Analysis of transcriptional and proteomic changes revealed significant dysregulation of PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways suggesting a basis for changes in contractile machinery, cytoskeletal arrangement, and transcription factor activity. Additionally, we were able to identify a novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor that can modulate ASM function. By recognizing the newborn CF pig as a model of ASM hyperreactivity absent inflammation, we can enhance our molecular understanding of ASM biology and pathophysiology in addition to discovering novel therapeutics for airflow limitation.

Recently we have attempted to improve our methodologies to allow better assessment of MCC from regions of the lung affected in early CF lung disease, the small airways and the apical lung regions. In healthy subjects we have shown that large particles (9.5 \u03bcm) inhaled very slowly (0.08 LPS) (SILP method) bypass the extrathoracic airways and more efficiently deposit in the bronchial airways when compared to standard tidal breathing (0.5 LPS) of 5 \u03bcm particles (TB method) (Zeman KL, et al. J Aerosol Med Pulm Drug Deliv. 2010;23:363\u20109). Finally, we hypothesized that having CF patients inhale the radioaerosol in the supine position, to remove the gravitational dependence of ventilation to the base of the lungs, would enhance our ability to measure MCC from the lung apices.",

Although overall effects on lung function (eg, FEV1) were statistically significant; they were modest, suggesting the need for additional therapeutic approaches with an alternative mechanism of action. Therefore, we measured the enhanced in vitro effects of a S\u2010nitrosoglutathione reductase inhibitor (GSNORi, N91115) on modulating CFTR when added to a CFTR corrector (VX\u2010809 or VX\u2010661) + CFTR potentiator (VX\u2010770) by; 1) measuring CFTR activity in primary human CF (F508del/F508del) airway epithelial (HAE) cells by Ussing chamber analysis and; 2) quantifying plasma membrane (PM) CFTR protein expression and turnover in a CFBE41o\u2010 cell line. First, although addition of N91115 to chronic CFTR corrector + potentiator resulted in a comparable level of initial forskolin\u2010mediated CFTR activation in Ussing chambers, the addition of N91115 appeared to \u201cstabilize\u201d the level of CFTR activity up to the time of inhibition by CFTRinh172. A positive change in slope was also observed reflecting sustained N91115\u2010mediated CFTR activity. Area under the curve (AUC), measured as total net chloride secretion from CFTR activation to inhibition, also demonstrated a significant improvement with the addition of N91115 versus corrector + potentiator alone. Moreover, when N91115 was added to chronic CFTR corrector + acute CFTR potentiator, a further increase in potentiator\u2010mediated short circuit current (Isc) as well as an increase in total potentiated CFTR (CFTR\u2010stimulated AUC) was observed. The Isc that was inhibited by CFTRinh172 was also significantly greater in CF HAE cells treated with N91115 + corrector versus corrector alone, further suggesting an additive increase of CFTR activity with N91115. Second, expression of CFTR at the plasma membrane (PM) was measured by On\u2010Cell Western analysis in CFBE41o\u2010 cells expressing an F508del\u20103HA tag on an extracellular loop of CFTR. We observed a significant increase in PM CFTR expression when N91115 was added alone as well as in addition to a CFTR corrector. When cells were treated with chronic CFTR corrector + potentiator, a significant decrease in PM CFTR was observed. However, this decrease in PM CFTR expression was significantly reversed back to corrector treated levels alone with the addition of N91115. Furthermore, PM CFTR turnover (CFTR remaining at the PM up to 3 hours) was significantly improved when N91115 was added to a CFTR corrector, or CFTR corrector + potentiator, demonstrating increased PM CFTR stability. Currently, additional in vitro studies are ongoing to explore the effects of GSNORi on wild\u2010type CFTR expression, function, and stability. Overall, this preclinical data provides evidence for the utilization of an additive therapy approach using N91115 to stabilize corrected and potentiated CFTR at the plasma membrane of CF patients.",

We recently characterized P. aeruginosa biofilm growth on primary CF airway epithelial cells (AECs) and observed enhanced biofilm formation during co\u2010infection with respiratory viruses (Hendricks MR, et al. PNAS. 2016;113:1642\u20107). We hypothesize that infection with respiratory viruses alters microbial community dynamics in the CF airways, affecting the balance between S. aureus and P. aeruginosa populations. The goals of this work are: 1) to compare S. aureus biofilm growth on CF and non\u2010CF AECs, and 2) to study the dynamics of S. aureus infection alone and during co\u2010infection with P. aeruginosa and respiratory viruses. Initial studies showed a 3\u2010log increase in S. aureus on immortalized CF bronchial AECs over 24 hours, and confocal microscopy revealed biofilm\u2010like clusters of bacteria on AECs. Measuring expression of biofilm and planktonic marker genes using quantitative real\u2010time PCR confirmed S. aureus exists in a biofilm state on CF AECs. To learn if S. aureus biofilm growth differs at distinct sites in the respiratory tract, biofilm assays were performed on well\u2010differentiated primary CF and non\u2010CF bronchial, nasal, and sinonasal AECs. Infection of all non\u2010CF cell types resulted in a decrease in viable S. aureus over time. However, while CF nasal and sinonasal AECs showed killing activity towards S. aureus, CF bronchial AECs supported S. aureus growth. A similar trend in anti\u2010S. aureus activity was observed in growth assays utilizing airway surface liquid collected from primary AECs. Current studies are evaluating the airway surface liquid pH of CF and non\u2010CF bronchial cells to determine if pH dysregulation is a factor impacting the ability of CF bronchial AECs to kill S. aureus. In initial co\u2010infection experiments with S. aureus and P. aeruginosa on CF bronchial AECs, S. aureus biofilms grew during co\u2010infection with P. aeruginosa. However, when co\u2010infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), P. aeruginosa growth increased dramatically, while S. aureus growth decreased. Live\u2010cell imaging experiments evaluating biofilm formation on CF bronchial AECs under flow conditions showed both species of bacteria in close association within biofilms on AECs, and in the presence of RSV co\u2010infection, P. aeruginosa dominated growth. Ongoing experiments are investigating how specific host antimicrobial mechanisms utilized during viral\u2010bacterial co\u2010infections might skew the microbial communities in the CF airway.",

Interestingly, mutants of genes homologous to E. coli HOCl\u2010sensing regulators (RclR, HypT and NemR) did not display altered susceptibility to HOCl. A mutant in mexT, which encodes a positive regulator of the multidrug efflux pump operon, mexEF\u2010oprN, was sensitive to HOCl, no growth was observed after 24 hours. A mutant in ampR, which encodes a global regulator found to negatively regulate mexEF\u2010oprN displayed HOCl resistance, as it exited lag phase 6 hours earlier than wild type (WT). Additional screening of strains with mutations in mexE and mexF for growth in the presence of HOCl identified an 8\u20109 and 5\u20108 hour delay, respectively, in exiting lag phase compared to WT, indicating HOCl sensitivity. P. aeruginosa clinical isolates from chronic CF lung infection have been identified with mutations in ampR or mexT, suggesting a potential role for these regulators in adaptation (Diaz Caballero J, et al. mBio, 2015;6:e00981\u201015). Furthermore, mutants of cbrA and cbrB, which encode a two\u2010component system that regulates carbon and nitrogen utilisation were resistant to HOCl, indicated by a rapid onset of growth compared to WT. CbrAB negatively regulates the global regulator crc via the small RNA crcZ, and a mutant in crc was sensitive to HOCl, no growth was observed after 24 hours. In addition to further investigations into HOCl protective mechanisms, the mutants identified are being used in assays to test the hypothesis that HOCl is crucial for neutrophil\u2010mediated killing of bacteria in the context of CF infection.",

Indeed this results in profoundly heterogeneous populations of PA isolates that differ markedly with respect to colony morphology, antibiotic resistance and virulence potential. Whether dynamics in this diverse population of infecting PA exist \u2010 potentially influencing the occurrence of an exacerbation and/or treatment response is heretofore unknown. The major barrier in understanding flux in PA population dynamics relates to finding a convenient method by which to collect regular samples. Serial home collection and storage of frozen sputum followed en masse by thawing and recovery of isolates offers the potential to overcome this limitation.

In the long term, this static mucoid environment gets colonized by a diverse community of microbes, viruses and fungi, therefore, becoming a reservoir for infection and requiring chronic treatment with antibiotics. Generally, the choice of antibiotic is not targeted and in many cases is administered after the infection has advanced. In addition to long\u2010term side effects of these drugs, eventually antibiotic resistant bacteria and fungi can take hold and complicate further treatment. Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGEN), in collaboration with the University of Arizona, has initiated a study to track changes in the microbial and fungal community over time in patients with CF. The purpose of this study is to better understand the CF pulmonary microbiome over time and determine if emerging pathogens and antibiotic resistance can be detected prior to exacerbation. A primary goal of the study is to develop and evaluate personalized, targeted microbiome assays for rapid characterization of a patient's current pulmonary community. These prototype diagnostics could potentially be used to advise treatment that is personalized and timely.",

            "text": "Current diagnostics of CF exacerbations are based on clinical culturing of microbial isolates from sputum samples followed by antibiotic susceptibility testing. Despite this established gold standard, studies have shown that antimicrobial susceptibility profiles frequently do not correlate with clinical outcomes. In some instances, antibiotic treatment still results in patient recovery despite highly reported resistance. This underlies the incomplete understanding of the microbial basis of CF exacerbations and the best methods for treatment. The likely cause of this discrepancy is that many pathogens in CF lungs are not identified in standard clinical labs. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene profiling has shown that CF lung infections are much more diverse than that revealed by clinical culture. Thus, we have begun to implement a \u201cRapid Response\u201d pipeline for CF exacerbations that employs multi\u2010omics data including transcriptome, metabolome and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to provide a timely, comprehensive assessment to clinicians. Sputum samples are collected and then DNA, RNA and metabolites extracted, followed by nucleic acid sequencing and mass spectrometry, and finally, data analysis. The pipeline generates microbial taxonomy, gene expression and metabolite production information requiring high\u2010powered computational resources to analyze. Despite the enormous scale of the data generated, a highly streamlined and integrative bioinformatics pipeline allows for analysis in less than 48 hours using a small group of people. Information is provided on virulence factor production, host inflammatory signals, gene expression of both microbes and host, taxonomic profiles of bacterial lung infections, including any new pathogens that may be driving an exacerbation event, and penetration of drugs to the site of infection. Recent application of this pipeline to a severe exacerbation event showed Pseudomonas aeruginosa growth was slow despite 95% of the lung microbiome being composed of this bacterium, expressing mostly alginate and iron chelating genes, while the 16S rDNA sequencing revealed a possible bloom of anaerobes. Metabolite production matched transcriptome profiling in that both detected the production of the siderophore pyochelin and also revealed that antibiotics given to the patient were reaching the site of infection. In this instance, the omics pipelines had mosly harmonious conclusions about this exacerbation. The future of CF exacerbation diagnostics and other diseases involving complex infections will employ multi\u2010omics data, because efforts such as this one, show that timeframes for producing, analyzing, and translating this rich data to physicians now approaches the gold standard of bacterial culture.",

The Burkholderia cenocepacia complex (Bcc) is a group of 18 genetically distinct species. Although generally harmless to humans, they are extremely pathogenic to CF patients, and acquisition of Bcc is associated with a significant increase in mortality. Treatment of Bcc infections are difficult as the bacteria are multidrug resistant and able to survive in biofilms (Mahenthiralingam E, et al. Clin Infect Dis. 2002;33:1469\u201075). Short Palate Lung and Nasal Epithelial Clone 1 (SPLUNC1) is secreted by the airway epithilia and is a multifunctional innate defense protein. SPLUNC1 is known to have antimicrobial functions against many gram\u2010negative bacteria including Bcc. CF airway surface liquid (ASL) is characterized with an increase of acidity which renders SPLUNC1 inactive and unable to regulate the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) (Garland AL, et al. PNAS. 2013;110:15973\u20108). We therefore tested the hypotheses that SPLUNC1's antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity against Bcc were also pH\u2010sensitive.",

Bcc clinical isolate J2315 was then cultured for 24 h for biofilms in the presence of 0.4 \u03bcM SPLUNC1 at pH range of 6 to 7.5. Biofilm growth was measured by crystal violet (CV) staining.

Treatment of PEx in the hospital has certain advantages, however a 2\u2010week hospital stay disrupts school and other daily activities and the whole family's life.

Home intravenous (IV) therapy has been implemented worldwide for the past 4 decades and is the most commonly used treatment of PEx in adults with CF.

New and innovative therapeutics have been geared towards improving not only Cftr expression and activity, but also to manage inflammation and chronic infection. Using in vivo murine models, bone marrow transplantation of Cftr\u2010deficient animals with wild\u2010type bone marrow has been shown to provide benefit in decreasing inflammation and aiding in infection resolution. The use of bone marrow transplantation however, is counter\u2010intuitive for CF, since the immunosuppressive therapy required to prevent transplant rejection has the potential of exacerbating the chronic pulmonary infection in CF patients. We have begun to pursue the concept of autologous bone marrow corrective therapeutics and mesenchymal stem cells as an alternative cell therapy to traditional transplantation in CF as a potential means to improved management of infection and inflammation. We created the myeloid\u2010specific knockout, in which only the myeloid cells are deficient in CFTR as well as the myeloid\u2010specific knock\u2010in where CFTR is deficient everywhere but the myeloid compartment. Further, bone marrow\u2010derived macrophages from both CFTR deficient and wild\u2010type animals were infused in the murine model of CF infection and inflammation to investigate the therapeutic potential of treating CF with autologous cells in the absence of irradiation and immunosuppressive therapy. The impact of the bone marrow\u2010derived cells on CF lung infection and inflammation was investigated using the CF murine model of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. We demonstrate that the myeloid\u2010specific knockout has a phenotype which is not as severe as the total knockout, but is significantly more fragile in the ability to manage infection when compared to wild\u2010type animals infected at the same time consistent with previous studies. Using our myeloid\u2010specific knock\u2010in, we demonstrate that although there is no statistical improvement in survival in the murine model of lung infection and inflammation, there are several immune parameters which are improved in terms of cytokine regulation and bacterial resolution. When Cftr\u2010deficient animals were given wild\u2010type bone marrow\u2010derived macrophages (without irradiation), the infusion statistically improved both inflammation and infection resolution. These studies are consistent with the bone marrow transplantation and mesenchymal stem cell studies, suggesting that wild\u2010type hematopoietic bone marrow cells (bone marrow, macrophages and mesenchymal stem cells), have the potential of supporting CF immunity, enhancing the management of infection and inflammation. As a next step in these studies we are beginning to explore genomic correction of myeloid cells, for potential therapeutic applications in CF.

            "text": "Chronic lung infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. P. aeruginosa enters a biofilm mode of growth during chronic infection in the CF lung, conferring vastly increased resistance to clearance by the immune system and antimicrobials. Clinical studies have found a correlation between respiratory viral infection and pulmonary colonization with P. aeruginosa, though the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is unknown. Using a unique model of the initial interaction of P. aeruginosa with respiratory epithelium, we have recently demonstrated that respiratory viral infection of the airway epithelium stimulates rapid biofilm biogenesis by P. aeruginosa, that apical iron\u2010bound transferrin release is increased during respiratory viral infection, and that the increased iron levels are required for the induction of biofilm production (Hendricks MR, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2016;113:1642\u20107). Additional studies have isolated the primary source of the biofilm stimulatory effect to extracellular vesicles released by the airway epithelium during viral infection. Using a co\u2010culture system of polarized CF bronchial epithelial cells and P. aeruginosa, we are investigating the mechanism by which P. aeruginosa is able to take advantage of the pulmonary environment following viral infection, focusing on iron uptake and homeostasis pathways. Preliminary data suggest that P. aeruginosa utilizes multiple iron uptake pathways, including siderophores, to scavenge increased iron in apical secretions from airway epithelial cells during viral co\u2010infection. Iron is not sufficient, however, to induce P. aeruginosa biofilm biogenesis, as supplementation of media with transferrin at concentrations similar to those found in apical secretions of airway cells during viral infection did not induce biofilm biogenesis. These results suggest that either additional factors or nutrients are present on the extracellular vesicles released by the respiratory epithelium during viral infection or that the transferrin must be delivered on extracellular vesicles to stimulate biofilm biogenesis. RNA sequencing analysis of the P. aeruginosa transcriptome during viral co\u2010infection revealed decreased expression of ferrous iron uptake pathways and increased expression of an uncharacterized putative iron uptake system, indicating an adaptive response to the increased levels of extracellular vesicle\u2010associated transferrin during viral co\u2010infection. Additionally, we observed shifts in P. aeruginosa amino acid catabolism pathways during viral co\u2010infection, suggesting that metabolic changes also play a role in adaptation to the conditions created by the viral infection. These studies suggest that nutritional immunity is compromised in the lung during viral infection and that P. aeruginosa alters its iron homeostasis and metabolism to take advantage of the more permissive environment, providing a potential mechanism by which P. aeruginosa more readily colonizes the lungs of CF patients during respiratory viral infection.",

In the later stages of CF, P. aeruginosa reside in chronic, antibiotic\u2010resistant biofilm communities in the lung, but little is known about the process by which chronic infections are established in the paranasal (PN) sinuses. Recent studies suggest that infection and colonization of the sinonasal cavity precedes colonization of the lower respiratory tract (Hansen SK, et al. ISME J. 2012;6:31\u201045). In addition, acquisition of chronic bacterial colonization in CF patients strongly correlates with respiratory viral infection (van Ewijk BE, et al. J Cyst Fibros. 2005;4(2 Suppl):31\u20106). We recently reported that respiratory viral infection promotes the conversion of P. aeruginosa to biofilm growth in association with bronchial epithelial cells and hastens the development of antibiotic resistance (Hendricks MR, et al. PNAS. 2016;113:1642\u20107; Melvin JA, et al. mSphere. 2016;1:pii:e00083\u201016). Enhanced biofilm growth was attributed to dysregulation of iron sequestration by the bronchial epithelium during viral infection, demonstrated through in vitro and in vivo observations of increased iron in the airway surface liquid. The current study extends these findings by investigating the impact of viral infections on chronic bacterial colonization and microbial communities in the PN sinuses. To test the hypothesis that iron homeostasis is also altered in the PN sinuses during viral infection, leading to increased bacterial colonization and biofilm growth, we performed a prospective study in a cohort of CF subjects with chronic rhinosinusitis. In this study, PN sinus secretions are being collected, as well as microbiome and viral swabs and associated clinical disease severity scores, approximately every three months starting January 2015. We have preliminarily analyzed iron levels in the PN sinus secretions in subjects at baseline and during viral infections. Viral infection was detected in 19% of our samples, with rhinovirus accounting for 90% of infections, and iron levels were significantly increased in PN sinus secretions during viral infection. Using primary PN sinus epithelial cells derived from CF patients, we observed an increase in P. aeruginosa biofilm growth in the presence of rhinovirus co\u2010infection. Preliminary microbiome analysis found Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus to be the dominant genera and suggest shifts in the microbial communities of the PN sinuses occur during or following viral infections. Clinical disease severity and quality of life scores were not acutely altered during viral infection. Further study is required to better define shifts in the microbial community during respiratory viral infection of the upper respiratory tract and determine the long\u2010term impacts on disease outcomes.",

Thick mucus and biofilm formation in the CF lung can render therapeutics less effective. A series of non\u2010toxic derivatized polyglucosamines shown to be broadly active at dermal and mucosal interfaces encompass a newly developed class of molecules designated poly (acetyl, arginyl) glucosamine (PAAG). Specifically, the PAAG15A derivative is a non\u2010toxic, soluble, biopolymer shown to potentiate a wide range of antibiotics against both gram\u2010negative and gram\u2010positive bacteria and to effectively dissolve biofilms, including those of B. cepacia complex. The three\u2010dimensional checkerboard synergy and minimal biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) assays were used to examine antibiotic synergy against planktonic bacteria and the removal of biofilms formed by several clinical isolates of B. cepacia complex associated with cystic fibrosis, respectively. These studies demonstrate the ability of PAAG15A to potentiate antibiotic activity and remove biofilms with the goal of supporting more effective treatments.",

Co\u2010infection by Staphylococcus aureus with Pseudomonas aeruginosa occurs commonly in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) and is associated with higher lung disease morbidity and mortality. While previous studies have demonstrated interactions between these two species that impact growth and metabolism, little is known regarding the impact of polymicrobial interactions on biofilm formation, a bacterial community lifestyle suggested to predominate within CF lungs and to result in persistent infections. S. aureus secretes numerous exoproducts that are known to interact with host tissues, influencing inflammatory responses. The abundantly secreted S. aureus protein A (SpA) binds a range of human glycoproteins, immunoglobulins, and other molecules, with diverse effects on the host, including inhibiting phagocytosis of S. aureus cells. However, the potential effects of SpA and other S. aureus exoproducts on co\u2010infecting bacteria have not been explored. Here we show that S. aureus secreted products, including SpA, significantly alter two behaviors associated with persistent infection. We found that SpA inhibited biofilm formation by some P. aeruginosa CF sputum isolates, and it also inhibited phagocytosis by neutrophils of all P. aeruginosa isolates tested. Our results indicate that these effects were mediated by binding to at least two P. aeruginosa cell surface structures\u2014type IV pili and the exopolysaccharide Psl\u2014 that confer attachment to surfaces and to other bacterial cells. Thus, we found that the role of a well\u2010studied S. aureus exoproduct, SpA, extends well beyond interactions with the host immune system, impacting persistence\u2010related behaviors of another important and common CF pathogen. Because S. aureus frequently precedes P. aeruginosa in colonizing CF patient lungs, these findings suggest new models of how microbial community interactions can impact persistence and host interactions during co\u2010infection.",

Current guidelines do not address incorporating both medications into a patient's maintenance regimen, and there are no clinical trials that have been able to effectively evaluate the risks and benefits of such therapy. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to compare lung function (FEV1) and number of pulmonary exacerbations one year leading up to the initiation of dual rotating inhaled antibiotic therapy and one year after being on dual therapy.

Preferentially chosen sources of nitrogen and carbon are known to come from amino acids and polyamines, but sugars such as glucose which is elevated in the CF airway are less preferred substrates, although efficiently metabolised via the Entner\u2010Doudoroff pathway. If preferred nutrients are offered in a mixture along with non\u2010favoured carbon sources, catabolism of preferred substrates is regulated in an orderly fashion by catabolite repression control.

In the serum of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), the upregulation of several MMPs correlates positively with pulmonary exacerbations and decreased lung function (Roderfeld M, et al. J Cyst Fibros. 2009;8(5):338\u201047). CF patients have high levels of circulating bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and their monocytes express a LPS\u2010desensitized phenotype that impairs their ability to respond to bacterial stimuli (del Campo R, et al. PLoS ONE. 2011;6(12): e29577). Because MMP activity has been linked with creating a LPS\u2010desensitized phenotype via cleavage of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM\u20101) in healthy human monocytes, we hypothesized that MMPs could play a modulatory role on the inflammatory immune response of CF monocytes (G\u00f3mez\u2010Pi\u00f1a V, et al. J Immunol. 2007;179:4065\u20104073).

Intriguing in vitro data suggests QS signalling molecules can be \u201csensed\u201d at the epithelial surface via the T2R38 (bitter taste) receptor expressed on airway cilia (Lee RJ, et al. J Clin Invest. 2012;122:4145\u201059). Activation of this receptor is predicted to lead to changes in ciliary beat frequency and nitric oxide production, which may enhance bacterial clearance. Three common polymorphisms exist in the gene coding for this receptor, altering the amino acid sequence at positions 49, 262, and 296 and correlating with receptor function; the functional allele has proline\u2010alanine\u2010valine (PAV) whereas the non\u2010functional allele has alanine\u2010valine\u2010isoleucine (AVI) at these residues. In vitro response to QS molecules has been shown to be greatest in cells with the PAV/PAV genotype.

Sodium nitrite inhibits bacterial respiration, and thus may provide a novel antimicrobial approach. However P. aeruginosa has a highly branched respiratory chain, and thus the precise targets of nitrosative stress are unclear. A transposon screen identified roxSR as a potential regulator of nitrite sensitivity. RoxSR encodes a two\u2010component sensor\u2010kinase that regulates terminal oxidase expression in P. aeruginosa and may affect bacterial adaptation to nitrosative stress. Transcriptomic analysis was done with RNA sequencing to compare the roxSR strain to parental PAO1 in the presence and absence of sodium nitrite. In liquid, aerobic culture loss of roxSR leads to derepression of norCB, as well as misregulation of coxA. Exposure of PAO1 to nitrite leads to norCB as well as cbb3\u2010type cytochrome oxidases. In contrast, roxSR strains do not further upregulate norCB (which was upregulated in unexposed cultures), and misregulate the cytochrome oxidases. These data suggest that roxSR, in addition to anr and dnr, may regulate denitrification. Because the cytochrome oxidases are the principal genes regulated by roxSR, the role of the specific cytochrome oxidases in nitrite sensitivity was examined. Nitrite sensitivity for strains deleted in combinations of the cytochrome oxidases were tested in both aerobic LB liquid culture and in the human bronchial epithelial cell line and Pseudomonas biofilm co\u2010culture system that was previously described by Moreau\u2010Marquis et al. The airway epithelial associated biofilms were treated with increasing concentrations of sodium nitrite. The roxSR strain was 2\u2010fold more sensitive to nitrite than PAO1 under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Biotic biofilm formation was unimpaired, however resultant biofilms were more susceptible to growth inhibition by nitrite. In an acute mouse pneumonia model, C57BL6 mice were intranasally inoculated with PAO1 or roxSR. Bacteria were counted from the lung 24 hours later. Loss of roxSR leads to 3\u20104 log decrease in bacterial burden at 24 hours. In conclusion, the two\u2010component system RoxSR is a key regulator of the P. aeruginosa response to nitrite in liquid culture and biotic biofilms, as well as being required for adaptation to growth in the mouse lung. In addition to known regulation of the terminal cytochrome oxidases, this TCS also likely regulates denitrification.",

The alpha diversity scores increased with age. The abundance of Bacteroides, Blautia, Collinsella, and Coprococcus increased with age, while Bifidobacterium and Veillonella decreased with age. Cesarean delivery was associated with decreased Parabacteroides in the 1st y, decreased Bifidobacterium, Veillonella, Klebsiella, and Haemophilus in the 2nd, and decreased Veillonella and Klebsiella in the 3rd y. Higher abundance of Haemophilus in the 2nd and lactobacillus in the 3rd y were associated with eB \u22653mo. Acid blocker use was associated with increased Collinsella in the 2nd y.",

Epidemic strains of PA (ePA) have been described for their multidrug resistance. Within our clinic an ePA has recently been described (the Prairie Epidemic Strain; PES) whose infections are associated with increased risk of exacerbations, rate of lung function decline, and progression to end\u2010stage lung disease, compared to those with unique infections.

In children, S. aureus colonization/infection usually precedes chronic colonization of the respiratory tract by P. aeruginosa, and continues into adulthood, when it can be co\u2010isolated with P. aeruginosa from CF respiratory cultures. To date, it is unclear whether and how S. aureus is an independent contributor to CF lung disease pathogenesis and its impact on the progression of P. aeruginosa chronic lung infection. Exploring this causal association in humans is complicated by confounding variables that cannot be controlled individually. We recently developed and characterized a murine model of P. aeruginosa infection reliably mimicking the course of human infection (Cigana C, et al. Sci Rep. 2016;6:21465). Here, we take advantage of this murine model to study the role of S. aureus in the pathogenesis and progression of P. aeruginosa lung disease.",

It is characterized by antibiotic\u2010tolerant biofilms in the endobronchial mucus with zones of oxygen (O2) depletion mainly due to polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) activity. While the exact mechanisms affecting antibiotic effectiveness on biofilms remain unclear, accumulating evidence suggests that the efficiency of several bactericidal antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin, is enhanced by stimulation of the aerobic respiration of pathogens and that lack of O2 increases their tolerance. In fact, the bactericidal effect of several antibiotics requires bacterial metabolic activity and depends on the formation of reactive O2 radicals (ROS). Re\u2010oxygenation of O2\u2010depleted biofilms may thus improve susceptibility to ciprofloxacin possibly by restoring aerobic respiration. Our aim is to sensitize anoxic biofilms of wild\u2010type P. aeruginosa and a catalase\u2010deficient mutant (\u0394katA) to create tolerance against ciprofloxacin by hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT).",

A gap exists tracking early respiratory viral infections and relating these to lower airway inflammation and lung function abnormalities in CF infants in the first year of life.

MRSA infects young CF patients and often grows as biofilms which are more resistant than their wild\u2010type counterparts to antimicrobial therapy and clearance by the immune system. Even though MRSA infections are devastating clinically, there is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how dysfunctional immunity in the CF lung hampers bacterial clearance. The objectives of this study are: 1) to perform longitudinal sampling of CF patients to measure changes correlated with the ability of MRSA isolates to form biofilm, and 2) to determine the effect of CFTR mutations on the ability of macrophages to phagocytose and kill MRSA.",

This gene has homology to fixL of the rhizobial FixL/FixJ two\u2010component system. FixL is a sensory histidine kinase that detects oxygen tension and phosphorylates the transcription factor FixJ in low oxygen, leading to activation of the fixK gene. Our previous work identified that the fixLJ system is involved in biofilm formation, motility, and persistence in a murine model. The reference strain, B. dolosa AU0158, which was isolated from the index patient after several years of colonization, contains a point mutation in the fixL gene (S439) compared to the ancestral isolate (W439).

The development of chronic P. aeruginosa infections in the CF lung involves the formation of highly recalcitrant biofilm communities. Clinical observations have noted acquisition of chronic P. aeruginosa infection by CF patients often occurs during respiratory viral seasons, with up to 85% of new P. aeruginosa colonization occurring within 3 weeks following a respiratory viral infection (Johansen HK, Hoiby N. Thorax. 1992;47:109\u201011; Collinson J, et al. Thorax. 1996;51:1115\u201022). Although the mechanism underlying this interaction in the CF lung is not well understood, we have recently shown that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) co\u2010infection stimulates increased biofilm growth by P. aeruginosa on airway epithelial cells (AECs) through a mechanism that is dependent on the apical release of the host iron\u2010binding protein transferrin, suggesting that nutritional immunity is compromised in AECs during RSV co\u2010infection (Hendricks MR, et al. PNAS. 2016;113:1642\u20107). However, the mechanism by which transferrin is released from AECs during respiratory viral infection remains undefined. Transferrin mRNA and protein levels are not altered in AECs during RSV infection, suggesting an alternative mechanism of secretion. We hypothesized that respiratory viral infection alters transferrin trafficking within AECs and allows its apical secretion, thereby promoting P. aeruginosa biofilm biogenesis. We show in these studies that extracellular vesicles released apically from AECs during RSV co\u2010infection enhanced P. aeruginosa biofilm growth. Extracellular vesicles had significantly increased levels of iron and chelation of iron from the extracellular vesicles reduced their ability to stimulate P. aeruginosa biofilm growth. Interestingly, RSV infection enhanced the transcytosis and apical secretion of transferrin originating from the basolateral compartment of cells, loaded onto extracellular vesicles. Together these results suggest RSV infection redirects transferrin trafficking in AECs, resulting in the loading of transferrin onto apically released extracellular vesicles, which can be utilized as an iron source by P. aeruginosa to form biofilms. We are currently investigating the pathways by which RSV infection induces transferrin packaging and secretion in extracellular vesicles to stimulate P. aeruginosa biofilm growth. Our data suggest a novel mechanism by which the host response to viral infection contributes to the development of chronic pulmonary P. aeruginosa infection and provide mechanistic insight into our understanding of nutritional immunity in the lung.",

Only recently it was determined that NTM or more specifically Mycobacterium abscessus complex (MABSC) strains form biofilms in the CF lung during chronic infection, contributing to rapid clinical deterioration due to chronic inflammation and tissue damage. Thick mucus and biofilm formation in the CF lung can render therapeutics less effective. A series of nontoxic derivatized polyglucosamines shown to be broadly active at dermal and mucosal interfaces encompass a newly developed class of molecules designated poly (acetyl, arginyl) glucosamine (PAAG). Specifically, the PAAG15A derivative is a nontoxic, soluble, biopolymer shown to potentiate a wide range of antibiotics against both gram\u2010negative and gram\u2010positive bacteria and to effectively dissolve biofilms, including those of MABSC. The minimal biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) assay and stationary tissue culture plate biofilm assays were used to examine the removal of biofilms formed by several clinical isolates of MABSC associated with cystic fibrosis, respectively.

To address this issue, multiple antibodies against different CFTR domains were tested to examine CFTR expression in human peripheral blood neutrophils by flow cytometry. The data confirmed that resting neutrophils had pronounced CFTR expression. Activation of neutrophils in vitro with soluble or particulate agonists did not significantly increase CFTR expression level, but induced CFTR redistribution to cell surface. Such CFTR mobilization correlated with cell\u2010surface recruitment of formyl peptide receptor during secretory vesicle exocytosis.

A recent study from the United Kingdom (UK) used whole genome sequencing (WGS) to suggest person\u2010to\u2010person transmission of M. abscessus subsp. massiliense (Mmas) among CF patients (Bryant et al. Lancet. 2013;381:1551\u201060). Subsequent work found high genetic relatedness among Mmas isolates from geographically distinct outbreaks of respiratory and soft tissue infections suggesting a dominant circulating clone (Davidson et al. Infect Genet Evol. 2013;20:292\u20107; Tettelin et al. Emerg Infect Dis. 2014;20:364\u201071). In the current study, we utilized a molecular signature that is present in the outbreak strains, namely two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the rpoB gene, for identification of this subtype among non\u2010outbreak clinical Mmas from non\u2010CF patients. Then, WGS was performed to explore the genetic diversity and evolutionary history of isolates with the molecular signature compared to prior outbreak strains.",

P. aeruginosa infection is typically concurrent with colonization by oral microbiota and followed by secondary infection with other bacterial and fungal pathogens such as Burkholderia and Aspergillus species. High\u2010density P. aeruginosa populations such as those found in the CF airways produce significant concentrations of secreted metabolites, including at least 50 quinolone\u2010based small molecules. One of the most highly abundant of these is HQNO, which is detected at micromolar concentrations in CF sputum. Here we show that physiological levels of HQNO suppress innate immune function. Although the dysfunction in mechanical clearance in the CF airway is well characterized, CF patients also seem to have ill\u2010defined deficiencies in innate immune cell function as they have difficulty eradicating pathogens from the airway despite the presence of high numbers of phagocytes. Innate immune cells kill extracellular bacteria via phagocytosis and a subsequent oxidative burst in the phagosome through the production of high levels of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Phagocytosis and oxidative burst are activated by toll\u2010like receptor (TLR) signaling in response to pathogens, and activated phagocytes undergo a dramatic metabolic shift in order to generate the energy and reducing potential required to sustain a bactericidal oxidative burst. Stimulation of TLRs by pathogens induces the metabolic shift required by phagocytes to produce NO and ROS through activation of the kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Here we show that treating macrophages with physiological levels of HQNO inhibits oxidative burst and prevents phagocytic killing of P. aeruginosa, Burkholderia multivorans, and Staphylococcus aureus. Our data show that treating macrophages with HQNO prevents the activation of mTOR by TLR agonists. In host cells mTOR is negatively regulated by AMP\u2010activated kinase (AMPK), which is a central sensor of cellular energy stress through increased AMP:ATP ratio. The primary source of ATP in eukaryotic cells is oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondrial membrane. As HQNO has previously been described as an inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration, we tested the effect of physiological HQNO concentrations on mitochondrial activity. Our data show that HQNO is a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial activity, causing hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane and subsequent production of reactive oxygen species within the mitochondria indicating loss of mitochondrial function. Finally, we show that mTOR inhibition by HQNO is dependent on AMPK activation. In summary, HQNO induces AMPK activation, thereby inhibiting mTOR activation and bactericidal activity in phagocytes. We propose that HQNO produced by P. aeruginosa is a significant contributor to morbidity in CF patients by enhancing the immune defects in CF airways leading to further colonization by P. aeruginosa and secondary pathogens.",

Treatment of NTM lung disease is challenging, with limited numbers of active antibiotics and requirements for long courses of potentially toxic drugs. New strategies are desperately needed to improve efficacy of treatment regimens. Recent research with the related mycobacterial pathogen, M. tuberculosis (MTB) has demonstrated that expression of bacterial efflux pumps by MTB within macrophages contributes to both intracellular survival and antibiotic tolerance. Furthermore when verapamil (VER), which acts as an efflux pump inhibitor, is added to standard regimens in an MTB mouse model, it can shorten duration of treatment and reduce risk of relapse. These results in MTB led us to ask whether efflux pumps can serve as a new target for treatment of NTM pathogens.",

To determine whether VER can inhibit intramacrophage growth of NTM species we infected THP\u20101 macrophages and then treated infected cells with VER for 48h. VER reduced the colony forming units (CFU) of the MAC101 reference strain in THP\u20101 cells by nearly 10 fold (1 log), but effects observed on multiple CF patient MAC and MABSC strains were more variable, with some strains showing no effect and others demonstrating only subtle decreases in CFU. We also used broth microdilution to determine MICs for multiple antibiotics in the absence and presence of efflux pump inhibitors and did not see significant shifts in the MICs suggesting that VER cannot counteract intrinsic resistance to these antibiotics. We are currently using a THP\u20101 infection model to determine whether NTM pathogens develop macrophage\u2010induced tolerance, and if so whether VER can inhibit this tolerance.

Now, life expectancy has grown dramatically, and CF patients develop persistent infections with slow\u2010growing, antibiotic\u2010resistant gram\u2010negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia spp. Elucidating the available nutrients and the interactions between bacterial strains within the polymicrobial communities in the airways is essential for understanding persistent infections and patient outlook. We are interested in studying the metabolic interactions and nutrient flow between our clinical isolates Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Rothia mucilaginosa, dominant and long\u2010term residents of the CF polymicrobial community. By performing gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC\u2010MS) on mono\u2010 and co\u2010cultures, we were able to characterize molecules present in the interaction between our two clinical isolates. R. mucilaginosa produces metabolites consumed by P. aeruginosa, and may provoke the production of toxic molecules. For example, fermentation products such as 2,3\u2010butanedione provoke P. aeruginosa to produce more phenazines, which are toxic and can generate reactive oxygen species in the presence of oxygen, and may also act as an alternative electron acceptor in a low oxygen environment. A combination of metabolomics data and hypothesis\u2010driven experiments to better understand the interaction between P. aeruginosa and R. mucilaginosa will be presented.",

We focused first on the 15 common genes belonging to those two families. We identified 73% of G\u2010protein coupled receptor. We have already validated the expression of some of these genes.

We fit multivariable Poisson regression models to estimate risk of PEx adjusting for demographic and clinical predictors and stratified for adults (\u2265 18 years) and children (< 18 years).

Nine (60%) were under care at the Pediatric CF Centre. Patients with Bc were segregated from all other CF patients. MLST identified four different clones: 3 had ST102; 4, ST482; 2, ST771; and 6, ST404; all evenly infecting children and adults. Best FEV1%Pred on the year prior to cBc was 86 (45\u2010125).

Twelve (80%) were on nebulized colistin either for eradication therapy or cbi with P. aeruginosa. Ten (67%) including 5/6 adults had no change in their symptoms at cBc but five (three with ST404 and one each ST102 and ST482) had noted increased symptoms for weeks to months.

It is also a sensitive measure of lung disease in infants with cystic fibrosis (CF), with a potential role both in clinical practice and as a research outcome.

However, linear modeling is less useful in studies that require short\u2010term modeling of lung function such as metabolomics and metagenomic investigations.

The values of the median spline as well as the first and second derivative were calculated for each of these intervals. For each patient the following variables were calculated: a) the effective degrees of freedom of the spline; b) the number of local maxima and minima of the spline, first derivative and second derivative; c) the range between the 5th and 95th percentile values of the spline, first derivative and second derivative; d) the median value of the first and second derivatives. After correlating these 9 variables with clinical parameters, classes of the dynamic lung function variables were created and correlated with clinical phenotypes using published protocols (Conrad DJ, Bailey BA.

FEV1 dynamic classes were then generated with these nine variables forming 3 groups with classification error rates of about 10%. This strategy identified stable, intermediate and hypervariable FEV1 dynamic phenotypes. The stable FEV1 dynamic phenotype was seen more frequently than expected in a CF clinical phenotype D which is a male\u2010dominated phenotype with excellent lung function and nutritional status. The intermediate and hypervariable phenotypes were seen in two female\u2010dominated clinical phenotype groups with either good lung function (clinical phenotype C) and worse FEV1 (clinical phenotype E).

However, this decline in lung function shows considerable variability. If recognizable patterns of change exist in individual patients, defining these patterns could have important implications. Previously, Menendez et al. (Chest. 1980;77(2 Suppl):321\u20103) assessed patterns of FEV1 and FVC over time in 49 CF patients. They postulated the presence of an inflection point (IP) in some patients such that prior to the IP, the FEV1/FVC ratio changes little with time and remains in the normal range, while after the IP, it steadily declines. Based on this IP concept, they separated patients into 4 groups: (1) IP observed; (2) all observations in pre\u2010IP period; (3) all observations in post\u2010IP period; (4) Indeterminate. We extended this work by using a developmental dataset of 1200 patients randomly selected from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry to guide construction of an algorithm for identifying IP in individuals that can be applied to large databases.",

The CE test was performed using an electronically braked cycle ergometer which holds the power output constant independently of variations in cadence. The original Godfrey protocol with power output increments of 10 W in individuals with a height <120 cm, 15 W for those 120\u2013150 cm and 20 W for those >150 cm tall was used. The exercise time was kept within the 8\u201312 min (1). The MSWT was carried out in a standardized fashion using a CD player and two markers placed 9m apart. Patients had a paced 10\u2010meter shuttle walk test by Singh, et al adapted and validated for use in CF. Subjects were allowed to run increasing the number of levels to 15 with a maximum speed of 10.2 km. All patients completed both tests on the same day, the second test was sequentially carried out after an interval of at least 30 minutes to return to resting level values. Parameters measured for evaluation of the tests were pulse oximeter, HR and dyspnea scores. Exercise time duration was recorded. Distance and peak work rate were measured. Values were expressed as mean and standard deviation. T\u2010test and correlation analysis were used.",

Airway clearance treatment (ACT) aims to improve ventilation and mucociliary clearance through the removal of tenacious and obstructing secretions, however ACT often adds a significant treatment burden. High frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) is the most common method for ACT in the US CF population. The Aerobika\u00ae, an oscillatory positive expiratory pressure (OPEP) device, approved by the FDA in May 2013, has become a common device within the US CF care community, despite the paucity of published literature. Many CF ACT studies comparing modalities have been published; however, few studies compare simultaneous use of 2 ACT modalities in an outpatient setting. The objectives of our pilot study are to: 1) provide preliminary evidence on the clinical efficacy of augmented ACT in CF patients by combining simultaneous use of the Aerobika\u00ae and HFCWO, while providing preliminary data related to candidate primary outcomes that allows for future trials; 2) search for possible effects and associations; and 3) help inform decisions about larger clinical trials and patient inclusion criteria.",

Clin Orthop Relat Res. 1978;131:146\u201050). Past studies in children with CF suggest the degree of thoracic kyphosis positively correlates with severity of pulmonary disease as measured by FEV1 and FVC (Denton J, et al. Clin Orthop Relat Res. 981;155:71\u20104). Bone disease is a common complication of adults with CF resulting in low bone density and increased risk of fracture. Consideration may be given to increased kyphosis as an added risk factor for compression fracture. Trunk deformity by elevated thoracic kyphosis may compromise vital capacity in other patient populations as well (Swisher A, et al. CF 101 Phys Therapist. 2010;5,23). If there is a positive correlation between thoracic kyphosis and severity of lung compromise, postural correction as a potential positive intervention may be warranted. Our primary aim was to analyze the correlation between thoracic kyphosis as measured by Cobb angle and FEV1 and FVC as measurements of pulmonary disease.",

Modification of the selection criteria for transplantation for pediatric patients with CF could improve both pre\u2010 and post\u2010transplant mortality. Previous research has demonstrated that the Cystic Fibrosis Questionniare\u2010Revised (CFQ\u2010R) is able to predict pre\u2010 and post\u2010transplant mortality in adults (Quittner AL, et al.

Using the landmarking approach (van Houwelingen H. Scand J Stat. 2007;34:70\u201085), Cox proportional hazard models were fitted at each landmark age. Fitting was restricted to individuals alive and uncensored at each landmark age, using predictors derived from available longitudinal measures of FEV1%. We began by using the \u201cusual\u201d level of FEV1% and its slope of change at the landmark age as predictors, obtained by fitting a linear mixed model to FEV1% measures in a period prior to the landmark age of interest. Four measures of FEV1% variability based on the interval up to the landmark age, were considered as additional predictors: (i) the standard deviation (SD) of FEV1% measures; (ii) the residual SD obtained from the mixed model; (iii) the range of FEV1%; (iv) the median deviation from the best FEV1% measure during the interval (following Morgan WJ, et al. J Pediatr. 2016;169:116\u201021). We show results from using a 5\u2010year interval prior to each landmark age.

The FEV1% measures were more highly predictive of 1\u2010year than 5\u2010year survival. The C\u2010index goes down across the landmark ages, indicating that the FEV1% measures are better predictors of survival at the younger ages. For prediction of 1\u2010 and 5\u2010year survival from age 11 the C\u2010index was approximately 0.95 and 0.89, respectively.

For infants with results between 3 and 4 SD above the mean, a second sample was requested. Newborns with values \u2265 4SD were sent to an urgent evaluation for a pediatric pulmonologist in the Cystic Fibrosis Clinic, and a second sample was taken.

Evidence from recent European studies suggests that protocols using immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) and pancreatitis\u2010associated protein (PAP) for cystic fibrosis (CF) newborn screening (NBS) may be successfully used as a purely biochemical NBS strategy. Pure IRT/PAP protocols can reach acceptable sensitivities and specificities, but this comes at the expense of a relatively low positive predictive value (PPV). The Dutch CHOPIN study (Vernooij\u2010van Langen AMM, et al. Thorax. 2012;67:289\u201095) has reported that using a three\u2010tier strategy (IRT/PAP + extended gene analysis) results in a better PPV. The German authorities decided also for an IRT/PAP/DNA protocol, but due to the strict German gene diagnostic act, extended gene analysis was not desirable as 3rd tier.",

CF newborn screening (CFNBS) provides an opportunity for early disease identification and intervention to avert the progression of lung disease. In California, CFNBS started in July of 2007. The screening algorithm implemented can detect previously known as well as novel mutations and variants of unknown significance, with corresponding varying degrees of CFTR dysfunction. This presents a diagnostic dilemma, as many will remain asymptomatic in early childhood, a condition categorized as CFTR\u2010related metabolic syndrome (CRMS). Only through the systematic and detailed longitudinal study of infants with CRMS can an understanding of the associated risk for lung disease be better established. We hypothesized that biomarkers reflective of the inflammatory activity from lung disease will differ between CF and CRMS infants. We evaluated a panel of inflammatory biomarkers in a cohort of infants identified through CFNBS. Plasma samples were obtained as part of a longitudinal prospective study during a period of good health and freedom from exacerbation. A human cytokine Luminex 63\u2010plex antibody bead kit (custom\u2010built by eBiosciences, San Diego, CA) was used according to manufacturer's recommendations. Of particular interest inflammatory cytokines typically reported in CF lung disease such as IL\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u20108 were not significantly different between the groups and found at low levels, perhaps as a reflection of their stable health and early stage in the disease process. However, we did notice differences in cytokines associated with immune modulation, response to infection and innate immunity. Statistically significant differences were noted between infants with CF and those with CRMS (boxplots for distribution by study group in Figure, all comparisons p<0.05), with CF infants demonstrating increased levels (in pg/mL) of the proinflammatory cytokines MIG, TNF\u03b1, VEGF, Resistin, and MIP1\u03b2, and lower levels of the immunemodulatory IL\u201022. We conclude that systemic inflammatory profiling in CF NBS infants demonstrates significant differences, with a benign profile for infants with CRMS suggesting a lack of significant lung disease early in life in this group.",

All ICFs for active patients (n=189) were uploaded into PortCF. All original ICFs were refiled alphabetically. Next, methods for obtaining, recording, and filing ICFs were reviewed. Previously the consent process was completed by clinicians and research staff and a list was kept of enrollments only, including ICF date. Several barriers to the ICF process were identified including multiple individuals involved with no set process, inconsistent communication between staff consenting and staff enrolling the patient into PortCF, inefficient filing system and inadequate tracking of ICFs.",

Of note, the amendment did not affect their participation in PortCF and they are no longer seen at our center. These events were reported to the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin IRB. We improved our processes for consistency and efficiency, and to prevent future errors from occurring. In our new process, ICF is only obtained only by a research team member. This includes the CF Registry Coordinator (CFRC) who is a research coordinator, the lead Research Coordinator, or the Research Manager. Once the ICF is signed, the CFRC then a) updates a tracking spreadsheet; b) sends a copy of ICF to medical records; c) scans ICF for electronic archiving; d) files original ICF alphabetically; e) enrolls patient in PortCF; f) uploads ICF into PortCF. New lists have been created to track patients who declined consent or are not enrolled and those who have not been approached for initial consent or require re\u2010consent due to age.

The first intervention was to re\u2010educate the nursing staff on accurate anthropometric measurement techniques. A digital stadiometer was installed in the CF clinic. Height measurements were monitored for the next 6 months and variability between clinic visits was recorded with the average difference between visit per patient reduced from 1.75\u00b11.31 to 0.38\u00b10.35 cm. The KA revealed a linear relationship between BMI and CF nutrition knowledge. Patient comments identified nutritional barriers of time and cost of food and/or supplements. The MA was notable for inconsistent provider nutrition recommendations, including use of oral supplements and discussion of feeding tubes. Based on these findings we designed a multi\u2010faceted 4\u2010stage CF nutritional algorithm that incorporates patient education and standardizes nutrition interventions based on severity of malnutrition. For each patient the CF dietitian tracks education received, nutrition goals, interventions recommended, and stage on the algorithm. Nutrition status of each patient is discussed in the pre\u2010clinic multidisciplinary meeting, and we incorporate nutritional information, algorithm interventions, and goals for the next appointment into the CF clinic note template. Educational materials that describe nutritional supplements and financial resources were developed. Over the first 6 months of our nutrition initiative the average BMI of our adult patients has increased from a median of 22.0 to a median of 22.6.",

Agreement between providers and patients was found in regards to usefulness (patients: 92% [11/12]; providers: 91% [10/11]) and working together to make decisions (patients: 67% [8/12]; providers: 73% [8/11]).

Patients commented that the dashboard empowered pre\u2010visit planning and development of an agenda driven by their goals/concerns, allowing for deeper evaluation and questions during clinic. The ability to trend health metrics side\u2010by\u2010side coupled with ongoing tracking, goals, reminders, and after\u2010visit summary were also positives. Areas for improvement from patients/parents included confusing wording and potential disruptions in authentic conversation. Provider positives included strengths in preparation for visit, adding structure, focusing on patient concerns, usefulness of sharing graphs for FEV1 and BMI and streamlining clinic flow. Concerns from the provider perspective included adding clinician agenda, time for explanation, duplication of EMR and CFF Patient Registry reports, graphs that include more than simple trends, refinement of goal setting/action plan wording, and desire for alerts/notifications to assist with future planning.",

The first action was to hold the graduating patient accountable for making his or her appointment with the adult clinic. At the patient's last pediatric appointment, he or she is asked to make their first adult appointment and provide the date and time before discharge. This solved two problems by decreasing the amount of time that patients go without CF care and providing a definitive end date for pediatric care.

For IV dosing the calculator rounds the dose to the nearest vial size to minimize wasted medication. The CFADC was put in use for 6 months then an anonymous survey was given to the pulmonary physicians and CF center staff. The providers were asked to estimate the time it took them to dose the antibiotics with and without the calculator. They were also asked to rank the ease of deciding a dose and their confidence in that dose on a scale of one to ten, with ten representing the easiest and most confident, with and without the calculator.

Currently all 50 states screen for cystic fibrosis on the newborn screen. In Texas, CF screening was added to the panel in 2009. High levels of immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) protein in the blood may be a marker of cystic fibrosis. Texas uses an IRT/DNA algorithm, with initial screening using IRT and second screening, if required, screening for 40 common mutations. In some cases, understanding the possible outcome on a newborn screen and when to obtain a sweat chloride test on a newborn can be challenging. This confusion can lead to delayed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and delay initiation of treatment. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation awarded the pediatric center at the University of Texas\u2010Southwestern Medical Center/Children's Health a screening improvement program (SIP) grant in order to optimize the diagnosis and early treatment of newborns.

First, the CF annual lab order sheet was revised to make it easier for staff to order labs and OGTT testing. The staff was educated on CFRD and the importance of OGTT screening. Patient education on CFRD and OGTT testing was completed by MDs and registered dietitian and patient education materials were provided.

Much of this anxiety is related to the fear of the unknown and an unrealistic expectation as to risks that their child might have CF. Most NBS programs mandate genetic counseling, but this service can be quite variable depending on the Center. Genetic counseling is frequently not provided by genetic counselors (GCs) due to funding constraints or availability of a genetic counselor within the CF treatment centers. A GC is not a routine part of most pulmonary clinics, and as such, must be brought in from another program. In smaller or more rural centers, access to a GC might not be possible. The use of telemedicine has allowed access to genetic counseling services in many regions that would not otherwise have had access to these services either geographically or financially. There are two major issues that are significant to the provision of better GC services to families who are identified through the CF NBS program: reducing inappropriate anxiety by ensuring that families have appropriate information about the screen, the risks of CF, and the process that will be involved in coming to diagnostic resolution about their child, and ensuring that families have a better understanding of the genetic implications of having a child identified as being a carrier for CF, the possibility of having a future child who has CF, and the screening of other family members that is appropriate given the specific structure of the family and the specific mutations identified.",

This prompted us to examine the supplemental vitamin D dose in our patient population. We found that patients maintained sufficient serum levels when supplemented with an average of 2812 IU vitamin D in addition to any CF\u2010specific vitamins or multivitamins. Adherence, vitamin D formulation and degree of malabsorption may explain the wide range in supplemental vitamin D dose required (800 IU\u201010,000 IU daily). Our goals for 2016 are to further educate patients on the importance of vitamin D and thus improve adherence to the recommended regimen. Finally, utilizing these results we plan to further investigate and implement a standard maintenance dosing protocol of approximately 3000 IU daily in all of our patients.",

Over time, they can develop allergies to antibiotics that may be considered optimal for effective treatment. Patients with history of type\u2010I hypersensitivity reaction to an antibiotic can be desensitized to that drug if clinically necessary. Desensitization induces a temporary immune\u2010tolerant state, allowing for safe administration of the allergenic medication until scheduled doses are stopped. It is accomplished by administering increasing doses until the therapeutic dose is reached and tolerated. Due to risk for allergic reaction during this process, 1:1 nursing care is necessary. However, severe reactions are rare (Legere H, et al. J Cyst Fibros. 2009;8(6),418\u201024). CF patients are traditionally transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for this procedure and once completed, move back to the pulmonary unit (PU).

Data suggest current target serum trough concentrations may be excessive and area under the concentration\u2010time curve (AUC) monitoring may be more predictive of ODT exposure (Begg E, et al. Br J Clin Pharmac. 1995;36:605\u20109). Further data found that AUC values are frequently elevated despite trough levels of <1mg/mL (Coulthard K, et al. J Cyst Fibros. 2007;6:125\u201030).

For airway clearance therapy (ACT) CF center respiratory therapists (RTs) provided re\u2010training to all hospital RTs for ACT modalities and inhaled medications (this recently included IPV). For pulmonary exacerbations, the inpatient ACT goal became 6 h/day. Hospital implementation of EPIC electronic medical record (EMR) allowed for a standard order set. CF\u2010specific teaching was provided to hospitalists. Then, in 2015 admissions were centralized to a specific respiratory\u2010focused floor.

PortCF data from 2014 show that antibiotic duration has not changed (13.5 d). Because the current literature lacks additional metrics to determine the effectiveness of a hospitalization, this proposal will evaluate change in CRP levels during hospitalization, change in lung function (e.g., FEV1 returns within 90% of baseline) during hospitalization, and improved lung function after hospitalization for pulmonary exacerbations. For admissions to treat distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS), time until next episode of DIOS will be evaluated. Overall, PortCF data show continued improvement in lung function and BMI for adult patients.

The motivation for these nomograms is their ability to allow for graphical presentation of a prediction model that integrates patient measurements, labeled predictors. Each predictor is modeled by a scale, with each possible value/category of that predictor corresponding to a specific number of points based on the prognostic significance of the value/category. The model is represented graphically with the scales of the predictors and how they combine to calculate the continuous probability of a particular outcome illustrated.

Texas has one of the highest rates of food insecurity in the country, with 18 percent of households experiencing food insecurity, compared to the national average of 14 percent. Maintaining sufficient supply of food is important for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) due to increased physiologic demand for nutrients and poor absorption. Poor nutrition status is correlated with decline in pulmonary function in patients with CF (Bell SC, et al. Clin Nutr. 1998;17:211\u20105). Food insecurity is associated with an increase in depression and decrease in adherence to medical treatments in other chronic diseases (Silverman J, et al. J Gen Intern Med. 2015;30:1476\u201080).

F508del fed 2.59 \u00b1 0.2, n = 4; 6 hour fast 1.16 \u00b1 0.15, n = 12*; 12 hour fast 0.02 \u00b1 0.01, n = 7. * p \u2264 0.009. Livers from CF female mice had more glycogen than WT, either in the fed state or after 6hr fasting, yet blood glucose levels were lower, indicating that CF mice may have a problem releasing glucose from stored glycogen. Calorimetry was used to measure respiratory quotient (RQ) in F508del and WT male mice, 11 weeks old for 48 hours (4 each), last 12 hours without food. RQ indicated that in the presence of food, CF mice preferentially burned carbohydrates at night but fat during the day, more so than WT. When food was withdrawn at night, CF mice switched to fat stores sooner that WT. Our data indicate that pancreatic sufficient, young CF mice are able to use readily available carbohydrates as energy substrate and are more sensitive to their utilization presumably by the periphery (indicating enhanced insulin sensitivity at that age). However, they are less effective at accessing their stored glycogen and deplete dietary carbohydrates faster than WT. This metabolic scenario could contribute to glucose intolerance seen in CF patients even in the absence of CFRD.",

There are generally two ways that CF patients use to calculate pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) for each meal. By far the most popular is based on weight, lipase/kg patient/meal. A typical range is 500\u20102500 lipase unit/kg patient/meal. This may, however, not be the best way to assess required enzyme dosing and not the best for optimization of nutritional status. The alternative strategy is to calculate the grams of fat in each meal, and then to base pill strength on a known lipase units per gram of fat per meal. This is not commonly undertaken, although is an alternative that has been endorsed by the CF Foundation. This study's purpose is to assess the potential benefit in cystic fibrosis patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) who use a smartphone app to manage dosing of pancreatic enzymes in order to optimize health and nutritional status.",

The CF patients had a range of lung disease (FEV1 = 45 \u2010 127%) but only one CF patient showed signs of early liver disease as evidenced by elevated gamma\u2010glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) levels. The non\u2010CF volunteers had no known liver disease. Quantitative T1 relaxation time maps of each subject's liver were obtained using a Siemens Espree 1.5T MRI scanner. The T1 data were acquired in a single breath hold using a rapid snapshot inversion MRI technique similar to previously described methods to assess CF lung disease (Donnola SB, et al. J Cyst Fibros. 2015). Biliary dilatation was measured for each subject by manually segmenting the bile ducts (high T1 values) from the normal liver parenchyma (lower T1 values) in each imaging slice.

We generated F508del mice lacking the expression of HDAC6 (F508del/Hdac6) to determine what CF phenotypes could be attributed to microtubule alterations in vivo. One phenotype that is corrected in F508del Cftr mice by the ablation of HDAC6 is the restoration of fat accumulation and the associated increase in weight gain.

Consistent with epithelial cells, CF 3T3\u2010L1 cells exhibited 0.13 +/\u2010 0.02 fold reduction in acetylated tubulin levels compared to controls. It was also determined that the pre\u2010adipocyte marker Kr\u00fcppel\u2010like factor 2 (KLF2) was expressed 2.6 +/\u2010 0.4 fold greater in CF 3T3\u2010L1 cells compared to WT cells. This increase in KLF2 expression is likely significant since it has been demonstrated that elevated KLF2 expression prevents pre\u2010adipocytes from differentiating into adipocytes (2). Quantitative RT\u2010PCR also shows KLF2 mRNA levels were increased in CF 3T3\u2010L1 cells 2.4 +/\u2010 0.4 fold over WT levels. Since F508del/Hdac6 mice are able to store fat, we examined whether HDAC6 inhibition could impact KLF2 expression. HDAC6 inhibition with tubastatin inhibited KLF2 expression in CF 3T3\u2010L1 cells in a dose\u2010dependent manner. Conversely, destabilizing microtubules with nocodazole in WT 3T3\u2010L1 cells results in a dose\u2010dependent increase in KLF2 expression. These data suggest that microtubule stabilization via HDAC6 inhibition improves pre\u2010adipocyte differentiation and allows for fat deposition in vivo. To verify these findings in primary tissue, epididymal fat from WT, F508del, and F508del/Hdac6 mice was examined for KLF2 expression. Consistent with the CF3T3\u2010L1 cell model, KLF2 expression was significantly increased in F508del mice fat compared to WT mice and restored to WT levels in F508del/Hdac6 mice.",

Transaminases, while good indicators of non\u2010CF liver disease, do not correlate well with CFLD, thus current screening primarily identifies end\u2010stage liver cirrhosis when synthetic function is compromised and portal hypertension has developed.

Despite aggressive, early nutritional intervention and pancreatic enzyme replacement and other therapies, early growth failure remains common among infants with CF, suggesting that PI is not the sole contributor to growth and nutritional failure. The identification of these growth and nutritional determinants in children with CF therefore remains a key research goal in CF care. A growing body of evidence supports a role for the gut microbiota in nutrient harvest and metabolism, and these microbiota are often altered in a variety of disease states. Therefore, infant GI tract microbes may be important determinants of CF nutritional outcomes. We recently showed that infants and children with CF had GI microbiota that differ markedly from those of children without CF, and that this dysbiosis correlated with fecal measures of fat malabsorption and inflammation, further supporting a role in early CF growth and GI function.",

            "text": "Beta\u2010cell dysfunction in cystic fibrosis (CF) is widely accepted as the cause of cystic fibrosis\u2010related diabetes. It has been hypothesized that CFTR expression in beta\u2010cells plays an intrinsic role in insulin secretion. Support for this hypothesis is largely based on the finding that CFTR inhibitors impair insulin secretion and chloride transport in beta\u2010cells and/or isolated islets. We have also shown that isolated islets from newborn CF ferrets have impaired glucose\u2010stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), a finding that could be taken to support an intrinsic role for CFTR in islet insulin secretion. We sought to further investigate the mechanism of altered insulin secretion by CF ferret islets and to define the cell types within the pancreas and islets that express CFTR. Using single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH), we localized CFTR RNA expression in ferret and human pancreas and/or isolated islets. We found no evidence for CFTR expression in endocrine cells. Rather, a high level of CFTR RNA was expressed within CK7+ pancreatic ductal cells in both isolated islets and intact pancreas. Islets from neonatal CF ferrets demonstrated significantly blunted first (P<0.05) and second (P<0.05) phase insulin secretion as compared to non\u2010CF controls. Similarly, knockdown of CFTR mRNA in wild\u2010type adult ferret and human islets, using recombinant adenovirus expressing a CFTR\u2010shRNA, demonstrated impaired GSIS as compared to a control shRNA. Importantly, while others and we have observed that CFTRinh172 reduces insulin secretion by islets, we find that this compound also significantly reduced insulin secretion and glucose\u2010stimulated Ca2+\u2010fluxes by CFTR\u2010KO ferret islets, questioning the specificity of this inhibitor\u2010based approach. To investigate the mechanism of altered insulin responses by CF islets, we evaluated transcripts involved in beta\u2010cell function and maturation. Quantitative\u2010RNA analysis demonstrated significantly lower insulin and glucagon transcripts in CFTR\u2010KO islets but unchanged levels of glucose\u2010sensing RNAs (GCK, GLUT2, and GJA9). Similarly, CFTR knockdown in WT ferret islets reduced insulin RNA expression. RNAs involved in transcriptional regulation of beta\u2010cell maturation and proliferation (Neurod1, Ngn3, Pax4, Reg3a, and Serpinhb1) were increased in CFTR\u2010KO islets, while PDX1 and MafB expression remained unchanged. Interestingly, the expression of the exocrine duct marker CK7 and markers of stellate cell activation and inflammation (alpha\u2010SMA, Acta1, and TGFbeta1) were significantly increased in CFTR\u2010KO islets. Consistent with this observation, newborn CF pancreata demonstrated higher levels of activated stellate cells (Desmin/alpha\u2010SMA positive) as compared to non\u2010CF. These results suggest that CFTR impacts beta\u2010cell function via a paracrine mechanism through islet\u2010associated duct and/or stellate cells. Elucidation of the signal pathway(s) by which CFTR mutant ductal cells affect islet function requires further investigation.",

The traditional hypothesis is that CFRD is caused by progressive destruction of the exocrine pancreas, which leads to collateral damage of pancreatic islets. However, there is little direct evidence for this \u201ccollateral damage\u201d hypothesis. A recent study showed that CF patients who were pancreas\u2010sufficient had enhanced acute insulin response to arginine stimulation, suggesting that insulin secretory capacity in pancreas\u2010sufficient patients is enhanced rather than impaired. These data support an alternative hypothesis that CFTR may have an intrinsic role in the regulation of \u03b2\u2010cell insulin secretion.

Area under the curve (AUC) for the first 30 min of MMTT was calculated for glucose, C\u2010peptide, glucagon like peptide\u20101 (GLP), and gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP).",

            "text": "The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) anion channel in the ductal epithelium of the pancreas plays a critical role in transporting bicarbonate into the lumen of ducts. Bicarbonate anions alkalinize the ductal lumen and in turn inactivate the pancreatic digestive enzymes secreted by the pancreatic acinar cells. The loss of function of CFTR in cystic fibrosis (CF) causes a pH imbalance in the lumen and the persisting acidic environment is thought to prematurely activate digestive enzymes leading to inflammation, fibrosis, and loss of beta\u2010cell function. We have developed a CFTR\u2010KO ferret model that develops very similar pancreatic pathology to that seen in human CF patients. Using the CF ferret model, we sought to understand how the earliest phases of CF pancreatitis and exocrine dysfunction lead to endocrine pancreas abnormalities that influence insulin secretion. We hypothesized that neuroendocrine regulation during this phase is abnormal due to inflammation and that altered production of certain neuropeptides can negatively impact pancreatic endocrine function. Previously we have shown that newborn CF ferrets have impaired glucose tolerance and poorly regulated insulin secretion (impaired first phase insulin and accentuated second phase insulin secretion) despite normal islet cell mass (J Clin Invest. 2012;122:3755). Because isolated islets from CF newborn ferrets have similarly dysregulated insulin secretion, we hypothesized that the proinflammatory environment of the CF pancreas impairs functionality of islets. We screened plasma, urine, and pancreas for neuropeptides associated with inflammation and found calcitonin gene\u2010related peptide (CGRP) and bradykinin (BK) were both present at elevated levels in newborn CF ferrets. Therefore, we sought to determine if CGRP and/or BK impair islet hormone regulation and if so the mechanism of action. To study the action of BK on islets, we first localized bradykinin receptor 2 (BDKR2) on the endocrine hormone secreting cells of islets and found it localizes to alpha\u2010cells in humans and ferrets but in mice and rats BDKR2 localized to beta\u2010cells. Interestingly, in older CF ferrets BDKR2 localized to both beta\u2010cells and alpha\u2010cells. Since CF rats and mice lack pancreatic exocrine and endocrine disease observed in CF humans and ferrets, we sought to understand how BK might differentially affect insulin and glucagon secretion in ferrets and mice. Under low glucose conditions, BK treatment reduced glucagon secretion by ferret islets (2\u2010fold, P<0.05) while decreasing insulin secretion by mouse islets (10\u2010fold, P<0.05). By contrast, under high glucose conditions BK enhanced the secretory index of glucagon (4\u2010fold, P<0.05) while reducing the secretory index of insulin (2\u2010fold, P<0.05) in ferret islets. Studies dissecting the effect of CGRP on islet hormone secretion are underway and preliminary studies suggest that CGRP enhances insulin secretion by ferret islets under low glucose conditions. We hypothesize that these neuropeptides influence glucose sensitivity of the islet and may contribute to the poorly regulated insulin responses observed in early CF pancreatic disease.",

Changes in the secretion kinetics and/or magnitude of glucose responsiveness of insular\u2010 and entero\u2010endocrine hormones often precedes the diagnosis of CF\u2010related diabetes (CFRD). Prominent CF\u2010associated changes include impaired pancreatic polypeptide (PP) and first phase insulin secretion. Impaired PP secretion in CF patients, following glucose challenge or a meal, has largely been dismissed as important to the development of diabetes since PP knockout mice lack a known phenotype. However, PP responses are considered a potentially useful marker of diabetes in other forms of pancreatogenic (e.g. pancreatitis\u2010induced) diabetes mellitus. Herein, we evaluated the age of onset of PP secretion defects in CFTR\u2010KO ferrets and very young CF human subjects following mixed meal tolerance tests (MMTT) and/or oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT). PP responses following MMTT or OGTT were significantly reduced in 2\u20104 and 4\u201012 month old CF ferrets as compared to non\u2010CF ferrets. Similarly, reduced PP secretion following OGTT was observed in both 0.3\u20103 year (p<0.001) and 3\u20106 year (p<0.001) old children with CF (N=39) as compared to similar age non\u2010CF children (N=12). To evaluate whether PP secretion impacts glucose tolerance or the secretion of insular and enteroinsular axis hormones, we performed intramuscular injections of synthetic ferret PP protein in CF (N=8) and non\u2010CF (N=8) ferrets and examined the changes in blood glucose and the secretion of insulin, glucagon, GIP and GLP\u20101. PP injection differentially inhibited glucagon (p< 0.01) and enhanced GIP secretion (p<0.01) in CF animals. Using a second approach, we created a recombinant adeno\u2010associated virus that expresses ferret PP and performed intramuscular injection of AAV2/1\u2010PP in wild\u2010type ferrets (6\u20107 weeks of age, N=3, 8.4e8 DNAase resistant particles/gram body weight). AAV2/1\u2010PP infected ferrets demonstrated plasma PP levels \u02dc6 fold (p<0.001) higher than uninfected controls at 2\u20103 weeks of age. MMTT studies on these animals at 3 weeks post\u2010infection demonstrated improved glucose tolerance (p<0.01). Ongoing studies are evaluating whether recombinant PP expression enhances glucose tolerance in CF ferrets. We are also further delineating the mechanism of improved glucose tolerance in non\u2010CF animals using euglycemic hyperinsulinemic glucose clamps with tracers to evaluate glucose metabolism in the liver and peripheral organs. Such studies may provide new insights into mechanisms of PP action on glucose metabolism and CFRD pathogenesis.

Thus, the CFPreD patients had higher Glu at 2 hours (CFPreD 158\u00b115 mg/dL, CFNGT 99\u00b121 mg/dL, Ctrl 101\u00b117 mg/dL, p<0.05). There were no differences between CFNGT and CFPreD in terms of sex, age, BMI, pancreatic insufficiency and Pseudomonas colonization. Plasma EhCyS potentials were impressively oxidized at baseline in CFPreD patients (\u201065 \u00b1 9.6 mV). Two hours following an OGTT, controls and CFNGT also demonstrated a more oxidized plasma EhCyS. All groups demonstrated trends towards reduced total CyS following OGTT. Both CFNGT and CFPreD demonstrated trends towards more oxidized EhGSH at baseline as well.",

We also demonstrate that impressive systemic oxidation occurs in CFPreD patients at baseline. Surprisingly, the Ctrls and the CFNGT became oxidized in response to a glucose challenge. Taken together with our data in CF teens and young adults, these preliminary data are leading us to the concept that toddlers and young children can have acute systemic redox imbalance to the oxidized state when ingesting the simple sugar, glucose. Furthermore, because of loss of CFTR function, this acute imbalance may become chronic, pushing the patient along the continuum of CF prediabetes and ultimately CFRD.",

Semi\u2010structured individual interviews were conducted with ten young adults aged 18 \u2013 25 diagnosed with CF. An interview guide was used to elicit information about how individuals with CF understand, experience, and perceive social isolation from others with CF, ways in which they experience isolation, and the impact isolation has on their medical and psychosocial development. Interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded using grounded theory's constant comparative method. Analysis identified the importance of social connection and isolation as a common theme supported by participant's level of connection with others. Participants struggled to define normal in their daily lives.

The pediatric team re\u2010introduces the transition program to patients when they reach their early teens, a time when they are gaining independence. When ready, usually between 18 to 21 years of age, the adult pulmonologist meets the patient and family with the pediatric pulmonologist in the pediatric clinic. If the patient and family are not ready after this joint clinic session, the session can be repeated up to 3 times. Additionally, a tour of the adult inpatient and outpatient facilities is offered prior to transfer to adult care. This program was evaluated through 2 QI projects in 1992 and 2010. Following each evaluation, the transition process was modified to meet patients' expectations and improve patient satisfaction.

We have been told that this can cause anxiety and stress for both the patients and their families. Among the myriad changes encountered include an entirely new team, new clinic location and space, new inpatient setting, and shift to self\u2010care model. Our current transition program starts at age 14 with the initiation of private discussion time with the paediatric health care team and a questionnaire that tracks development of CF knowledge and self\u2010management skills. While this process does provide some level of preparedness in terms of knowledge and skill, patients and family still voiced anxiety about the actual physical experience of transition. Our Transition Night was created to provide an opportunity for transitioning youth and their families to meet and interact with the adult team, be introduced to the new clinic space and routines, meet other parents and be able to present their questions and concerns. Parents were invited to be present but due to infection control guidelines the youth were not able to attend in person. Therefore they were connected via live webinar feed. This gave them an opportunity to view the presentations, meet the adult clinic team and anonymously send in their questions. The evening session was recorded and posted on our CF clinic website and available as a teaching tool.",

To better identify patients who may benefit from psychological evaluation an abbreviated screening tool that addresses the unique demands of clinical time constraints was developed for routine use at the Arkansas Children's Hospital's two CF center sites. The Pediatric Behavioral Health Questionnaire (PBHQ; an 8\u2010item questionnaire that briefly assesses behavioral health across the following domains: anxiety, depression, behavior, academics, social, treatment, and family adjustment/stressors) was developed to increase the communication of behavioral health information for the purposes of identifying patient and caregiver service needs, standardizing the referral and routing of appropriate psychosocial treatment and services, and increasing access to care. Study aims included: establishing the internal reliability and external validity of the PBHQ and cross\u2010validating the PBHQ with a validated psychological questionnaire.",

Fifty (67%) respondents reported that their providers had talked with them about their health care needs as they become an adult, and 33 (45%) reported that a plan to address these needs had been developed. Thirty\u2010nine (53%) reported that they had talked about transferring to providers who treat adults. Sixty\u2010five (88%) reported that their provider usually or always encouraged them to take responsibility for health care needs, while only 24 (32%) reported that they had discussed maintaining health insurance as an adult. In bivariate analyses, higher TRAQ score was significantly associated with older age, lower FEV1, higher treatment complexity score, and positive responses to all transition counseling questions. There was no correlation between TRAQ score and any of the CFQ\u2010R quality of life domains. In a multivariable regression model, older age (\u03b2=0.14, p=.002) and higher treatment complexity (\u03b2=0.04, p=.006) remained significantly associated with higher TRAQ scores.

Thorax. 2014;69:1090\u20107). In turn, parental depression increases the risk of depression in youth with CF (Quittner AL, et al.) and negatively affects the child's adherence and health outcomes (Barker DH, Quittner, AL. Pediatrics. 2016;137e20152296). As a result, The CF Foundation and European CF Society consensus statements for screening and treating depression recommend annual screening for depression in parent caregivers of patients with CF ages 0\u201017 with the Patient Health Questionnaire\u20109 (PHQ\u20109) or the shorter PHQ\u20102 based on staffing and resources (Quittner AL, et al.

Due to low rates of caregiver depression observed in 2014 compared to the TIDES data, in 2015, caregivers of patients 0\u201017 years of age were randomized to screening with the PHQ\u20109 for half of the parents (last names A\u2010L) and the PHQ\u20102 for the other half (M\u2010Z).

This may reveal patterns of nonadherence which may be addressed to improve health outcomes. Claims data facilitates tracking healthcare utilization as new therapies and practice guidelines are introduced. With payors asking for justification for costly therapies, this may be essential data to have in coming years. In addition, a validated method to identify patients based on claims paid will allow identification of patients across multiple CF centers. This can allow assessment of healthcare utilization, prescribing patterns and patient adherence both across centers and within CF centers.

Other demographic and clinical covariates that may be related to HRQOL included age, gender, education, weight percentile, diabetes, pancreatic sufficiency, and colonization with Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and/or Burkholderia cepacia. Twelve stepwise hierarchical linear regression models were created, one for each CFQ\u2010R domain; clinical and demographic covariates were entered first, disease severity second, and employment status third.

It was noted that the CF patients have developed a dependency on the nurses and ancillary staff to do things such as waking them up for breathing treatments, take medications, and maintaining good personal hygiene. The goal of the study is to gain a better understanding of the CF patient's feelings towards self\u2010care during admissions. Requirements for participation in the study are admission to the hospital and being over the age of six years. The participants of the study earn points each day by actively participating in three breathing treatments, physical therapy, taking all prescribed nutritional supplements, and having good hygiene and good behavior throughout admission. Once the participants earn 33 points they are rewarded with coupons to either McDonald's or the Texas Children's Hospital Food Court. The participants are asked to complete a presurvey before starting the program and then a postsurvey just prior to discharge, then an additional postsurvey at their clinic follow\u2010up in approximately 2 weeks after discharge. The survey is a rating system designed to obtain information on how important the patients feel that certain aspects of their health care are to them. Our hope with this study is to help find motivating factors for the inpatient CF patients to take charge of their own care and be the key component for their overall outcomes during hospitalizations. The study is currently taking place and thus far has 16 participants with 3 repeat admissions. It is our goal to complete this study by the end of May 2016 with enough information to determine if our inpatient rewards program has had a positive effect on our patients' overall well\u2010being and self\u2010motivation.",

A desire for normalcy was seen to be important to many, with literature acknowledging that this desire for normalcy can be accompanied with the engagement of normalised risky behaviours as a retaliation against the illness identity. Evidence of a life orientated perspective was also prevalent, with participants reporting that they engaged in risky behaviours for fun. Overall there was a reported lack of knowledge concerning consequences of risky behaviours, with many participants stating they had not been informed of these by their clinicians. This was in line with a transition evaluation conducted by the researcher, which indicated that many UK CF units do not integrate a discussion on risky behaviours into a patient's transition to adult care. However, the results of the current research highlight the importance of awareness, with patients who had good awareness of the consequences of risky behaviours often accepting that they cannot engage in such behaviours.",

Funding was awarded from CF Foundation (CFF) for support of a Mental Health Coordinator (MHC) and SCH psychiatry and psychology consultation. Two CF parents and colleagues from the SCH Department of Psychiatry joined our QI team. In monthly meetings, we reviewed algorithms and screening methods from external clinics. Parent input from the QI team and the parent advisory council recommended an electronic platform to improve adolescent engagement with tablet interfaces. Outcomes Monitoring and Analytics Platform (The OWL) is an electronic screening and tracking platform chosen to enable the team to assess behavioral health status through instant scoring and secure tracking of PHQ\u20109 and GAD\u20107.

More significantly, some patients dropped two categories of severity from moderately severe to mild (GAD\u20107) and moderate to normal (PHQ\u20104). Patients scoring higher on their initial questionnaire appear to respond better to this treatment; with this in mind we should consider auricular acupuncture as an adjunct to treatment in CF patients with high anxiety and depression scores. This could be a valuable adjunct to physiotherapy treatment which takes a more holistic approach and could help reduce the amount of medication required by a patient. With this technique the patient is responsible for pressing the acupuncture needle as little or as often as required/wanted, thus giving the patient more control of their own care. This can lead to improved adherence and improved quality of life.",

However, several studies have demonstrated that many young adults with CF have mental health problems and low rates of adherence to prescribed treatments, which affects their physical health. Treatment guidelines recommend interventions to improve self\u2010management and adherence to therapies. Interventions centered on patient self\u2010management are focused on motivating patients to take control of their own care and make behavioral changes. We examined whether life coaching was an effective intervention to promote these goals. The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of a life coaching\u2010intervention in adults with CF.",

Behav Ther. 2004;35:639\u201065), will reduce depression and anxiety in CF patients, improving clinical outcomes including treatment adherence. ACT increases acceptance of painful emotions, thereby eliminating the need for behaviors designed to reduce or avoid anxiety and depression (eg, not taking medications to avoid thinking about having CF). ACT has proven successful in managing chronic pain (McCracken LM, et al. Eur J Pain. 2006;10:23\u20109), smoking (Gifford EV, et al. Behav Ther. 2004;35:689\u2010705), and substance use (Hayes SC, et al. Behav Ther. 2004;35:667\u201088).",

Standard of comprehensive cystic fibrosis (CF) care recommends that transition discussions begin early in treatment and continue until transfer. Adult providers expect that their patients are adept at treatment and have greater ability to manage their care than pediatric patients would; however not all patients have sufficient self\u2010care skills by the time they transfer to adult care. The objective of this project was to examine patient reported self\u2010care skills in two groups: transition\u2010age patients in a pediatric clinic and posttransfer patients in adult care.

The illness burden experienced by patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and their caregivers is characterized by problems in many domains (eg, physical symptoms, psychological distress, and caregiver burden). This burden fluctuates over years and gradually worsens in the context of advanced illness. CF is representative of a type of chronic condition that is best managed by the integration of a palliative plan of care with routine care throughout the disease trajectory\u2014an approach known as concurrent care. In this approach, interventions to address unmet need in defined domains of palliative care are undertaken throughout the course of the illness by CF professionals who have the support of palliative care specialists; referral to the specialist palliative care team is considered when illness is advanced, death is perceived to be soon, and problems are multiple and complex. At the present time, there are no existing models of concurrent palliative and primary CF care in the United States. The proposed study describes the implementation and mid\u2010project evaluation of an innovative model jointly developed by the Cystic Fibrosis Center (CFC) at Beth Israel Medical Center (BIMC) and the MJHS Institute for Innovation in Palliative Care. Recruitment concluded in January 2015. Of the 160 patients and caregivers screened, 152 were eligible and approached for the study with 76 patients and 55 caregivers consenting to the study and 21 declining. Since the implementation of screening for symptom burden, patients have completed 852 monthly screenings in total. Of these screenings, 149 patients were triggered for a triage evaluation by a social worker in one or more of the following domains: global distress (78), severe distress from pain (62), severe distress from dyspnea (50), psychological distress (43), and/or a request for advanced care planning (40). Of these 149 patients triggered, 73 were reachable by phone and completed the triage evaluation, and 76 were missed due to the patient being unreachable by telephone but were seen at a subsequent clinic visit. All missed triages occurred prior to May 2015 at which point the staffing model was changed to improve follow\u2010up. Since that time there have been no missed patients. Of the 72 patients who completed a triage, 23 required a follow\u2010up by the CF Center clinicians and all 23 received this follow\u2010up. We continue to screen patients monthly for symptom burden and unmet palliative care needs, and collect quarterly data on outcomes to determine the effectiveness of the intervention. In May 2016 we will be implementing a music therapy program specially designed for cystic fibrosis patients and assessing patient satisfaction through the web\u2010based survey system.",

Her respiratory status was stable for the first three weeks of admission, at which point she had a worsening of respiratory distress and noted air hunger. Her Bi\u2010PAP settings were adjusted as her blood gases worsened and she began to have an increase in her CO2 levels from her baseline, which was in the 60s. As her clinical status worsened, discussions were made on how to treat further. The parents, with the guidance of the team, made the determination to neither intubate nor to use heroic measures to extend her life. She initially continued with Bi\u2010PAP, chest physiotherapy and nebulizer treatments but after a discussion with a respiratory therapist who told the patient that she could decide how and even whether to continue treatments (unknown to the team, including parents), the patient began to refuse all interventions.

Poor sleep in children has also been associated with lower self\u2010esteem and difficulties socializing. Children who experience fear or worry often have difficulties falling asleep.

Based on these recommendations, preschoolers (3\u20105 years) should sleep between 10\u201013 hours a night, school\u2010aged children (6\u201013 years) should sleep between 9\u201011 hours a night, and teenagers (14\u201017 years) should sleep between 8\u201010 hours a night. The current study indicates that during the hospitalization of a sibling with cystic fibrosis, their well\u2010siblings are sleeping on average 7.6 hours a night, which falls below the recommended amount of sleep for all represented age ranges. Further, well\u2010siblings were quick to fall asleep during the hospitalization, as indicated by their sleep onset latency. This indicates a pattern of sleep deprivation in this population. Future research is needed to assess the relationship between sleep deficits and negative outcomes in siblings of children with cystic fibrosis.",

Parents generally rated all questionnaires as acceptable with PHQ9/GAD7 mean ratings between 4.06\u20104.67 and PAT mean ratings between 3.94\u20104.50.

Sleep Health. 2015;1(1):40\u20103). Inadequate sleep is linked to a multitude of negative outcomes, including behavior problems and decreased overall quality of life (Lavigne JV, et al. J Dev Behav Pediatr. 1999;20:164\u20109; Sadeh A, et al. Child Dev. 2002;73:405\u201017). Sleep disruption also has deleterious effects on metabolic function (Van Cauter E, et al.

As the life expectancy of those with CF continues to rise, it is important to prepare pediatric patients to live as independent adults.

Pediatrics. 2009;125:566\u201073). Questions of adherence complicate transition and transfer. Adolescents struggle with adherence related to increased care responsibility, treatment burden, perceived treatment benefit, and lack of education. Literature related to transition and transfer agrees on the need for standardized programs within centers. However, much of the literature discussing transition is descriptive, with measured outcomes relating to satisfaction and perceptions. Little has been done measuring quantitative health outcomes of transition programs, and there is no consensus on the best program to improve transition, (Tuchman E, et al.

One CF inpatient mentioned he did not have the support network in place for his recovery: \u201cI'm still thinking about lung transplant; but, mostly, when they describe to me how it is\u2014they told me there must be a family member to be with you, but I have nobody to do that.

This may be due to prognostic uncertainty on the part of both clinicians and patients regarding which patients may end up needing to be intubated.

The fact that there is a great deal of variation in people's desires to hear prognostic estimates suggests that care should be taken when assessing whether to convey such information to a patient. Decision aids used to facilitate shared decision making should elicit not only patients' values and preferences for outcomes but also their lived experiences, preconceived notions about treatment, and fears, all of which may impact how people understand medical information conveyed by clinicians, and which may be critical to understanding data for informed decision making.",

The transition to lung transplantation is a complex process that involves shared decision between providers and patients that should take into account disease severity, social factors, and mental health physiologic criteria as well as social and mental health and requires multidisciplinary coordination. Despite advances in the transition process for CF from pediatric care to adult care, little is known about the transition process to lung transplantation for those patients with CF and end\u2010stage lung disease. The aim of the study, therefore, is to evaluate how CF centers transition patients to transplantation and to understand the interaction between CF and transplant teams at CF centers.",

Inpatient Infection Control is notified of EVERY new CF patient to our center so that their charts may contain an alert which allows prompt initiation of contact or droplet precautions as indicated. Patient and family education was also initiated through our regular newsletters, mailers and in the outpatient department during visits. Packets were given with a Children's Hospital CF \u201cFastpass\u201d unique to our system, masks, and a letter outlining the new policies.
