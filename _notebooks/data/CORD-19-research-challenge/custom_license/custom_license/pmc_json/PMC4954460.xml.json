Viruses must also be isolated to allow their antigenic identification using the type\u2010 and subtype\u2010specific reference reagents provided in annually distributed WHO kits. Further detailed characterization may include sequence analyses to monitor genetic changes and assessment of virological traits such as resistance to antiviral drugs. Sequence data are shared within the GISRS using public databases such as GenBank and GISAID EpiFlu. NICs in some settings then attempt to relate potentially important virological changes observed with clinical and epidemiological information and trends and may even conduct serological studies to evaluate the immune status of the population.",

Such antibodies can neutralize the infectivity of viruses, and their level in the blood has been shown to correlate with the level of protection against infection with a homologous virus. As a result, influenza vaccine virus selection has primarily been based upon the antigenic characterization of virus HA using the haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay. HAI tests provide a visual readout of the ability of specific antibodies to prevent the attachment of HA to red blood cells (RBCs) and thus prevent their agglutination. Antigenic drift in the HA of circulating viruses in response to host immunity reduces the effectiveness of vaccines and is therefore the major consideration when recommendations are made on the composition of influenza vaccines.",

The resulting sets of reference viruses and antisera are then used to evaluate the antigenic characteristics of the HAs of recent isolates. Where antigenic differences are detected, these are likely to affect human immunity against the new variants.

This subset is selected to include representative circulating viruses, as well as apparent antigenic variants and viruses from severe or fatal cases. Phylogenetic analyses are carried out to better understand the evolution of circulating viruses, their degree of genetic heterogeneity and the emergence of new genetic clades. Antigenic or other phenotypic variants may thus be defined in terms of separate genetic clades with distinct amino acid signatures. Relating the locations of amino acid substitutions to antigenic, receptor\u2010binding or glycosylation sites on the 3D structure of the HA molecule then helps to identify the individual substitutions associated with phenotypic (antigenic) changes. Identifying such amino acid signatures also facilitates global monitoring of the emergence, distribution and impact of different genetic variants. This is particularly helpful when data on emergent variants are limited at the time of a WHO vaccine consultation. Comparisons of the sequences found in clinical specimens and virus isolates are also useful in revealing amino acid substitutions which result from passage in different substrates, mainly MDCK cells and eggs.

The data are set against the broader epidemiological context collated by WHO and are supported by serological data from WHOCCs and WHO ERLs, as well as by additional information provided by NICs. HAI data obtained in the different centres using a wide variety of reference viruses and ferret antisera are correlated using common reference reagents. In recent years, antigenic cartography has been used to collate and statistically visualize the degree of antigenic variation. The interpretation of HAI data may, however, be complicated by the influence of changes in the receptor\u2010binding properties of natural viruses or by the selection of variants during isolation and passaging in different cell or egg substrates. Comparisons with sequence data are made to relate any differences in antigenicity with specific HA genetic clades and to more precisely define the identity of antigenic variants.

As a consequence, decisions often have to be made relatively early in the influenza season. In addition, post\u2010infection ferret antisera against potential antigenic variants are urgently required to define their antigenic relationships to previously circulating viruses. Panels of recent isolates must also be prepared to assess the degree to which they are neutralized by antibodies in the sera of previously vaccinated individuals. Finally, potential new candidate vaccine viruses must be prepared and evaluated for their suitability in vaccine production. Ensuring the timely availability of viruses with suitable growth properties is a crucial step in ensuring that sufficient quantities of vaccine can be produced in time for administration prior to the next influenza season. Although cell culture has steadily replaced the use of embryonated eggs for the primary isolation of viruses, candidate vaccine viruses must still be isolated directly in eggs according to current regulatory requirements. The limited availability of egg isolates, particularly of recent H3N2 viruses which generally grow poorly in eggs, has led to the establishment of Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) and similar agreements between the vaccine industry and a number of WHOCCs to increase the availability of egg isolates for vaccine use.",

These studies should provide the basis for the introduction of a universal qualified cell culture system for providing mammalian cell\u2010derived seasonal influenza candidate vaccine viruses. This would result in a greater choice of candidates, especially for recent H3N2 viruses, and may provide greater flexibility in responding to the \u2018late\u2019 emergence of a variant necessitating a vaccine composition change. Such virus isolates would not be subject to undesirable egg\u2010selected changes and would potentially provide a better match to the natural virus. However, the relative merits of egg and cell culture candidate vaccine viruses have still to be rigorously evaluated. Guidance on quality assurance aspects has already been published by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The finalization of new EMA regulatory guidelines may be accompanied by a WHO technical document on harmonizing regulatory approaches worldwide and the engagement of other regulatory authorities in vaccine\u2010manufacturing nations.",

In addition, despite international consensus on the key quality specifications for 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccines, reagents to calibrate the majority of candidate vaccines using conventional potency tests only became available immediately prior to the initiation of clinical trials. In some cases, candidate vaccines were available ahead of the reagents. Although national authorities proved flexible in accepting the use of validated alternative potency tests to allow clinical trials to proceed, newer methods such as high\u2010performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometry are now being evaluated.",
