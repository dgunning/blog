            "text": "Chinese mahogany (Taihe Toona sinensis Roem, syn. Cedrela sinensis, family Meliaceae) is a perennial woody tree that grows 25 m high, and is used as a source of food, timber, and medicine, particularly in the Anhui province of China. Regarded as nutritious food, the edible buds and young leaves are commonly used to make the condiment Toona Paste, which has a floral and onion-like flavor (Park et al. 1996; Edmonds and Staniforth 1998). The unique flavor results from various natural compounds including triterpenes, phenolics, flavonoids, and lysine amino acid (Mu et al. 2007; Zhou et al. 2011; Kakumu et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2015). The mature, fibrous leaves of T. sinensis are used in Chinese traditional medicines to treat conditions ranging from diarrhea and other intestinal complaints to reproductive concerns and cancer. Recently, other biological properties of T. sinensis leaf extracts have been reported, including anti-inflammatory, analgesic, inhibition of boil growth inhibition, antioxidant, anti-diabetic, and anti-neoplastic, as well as anti-atherosclerotic, and inhibition of replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and of the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus (Hsu et al. 2003; Chia et al. 2010; Huang et al. 2012; Yang et al. 2013, 2014; You et al. 2013).",

Currently, only very limited information is available about the compounds contributing to the flavor of young leaves and the medicinal content of mature leaves of T. sinensis. Only a few reports have addressed the effects of flavonoids on the taste of young leaves. Flavonoids, lysine, and polyphenols increase the antioxidant capacity of plant cells and associated tissues, and are responsible for the antioxidant properties of T. sinensis buds and young leaves (Wang et al. 2007; Vinodhini and Lokeswari 2014).",

RNA-Seq allows analysis of complex transcriptional regulation and variable metabolic pathways of different flavonoids, including across different groups or tissues (Shi et al. 2014).

RNA sequencing data was de novo assembled and annotated, and candidate gene expression changes were characterized. For the first time, molecular regulation of the phenylpropanoid and naringenin biosynthesis pathways was characterized in this species. Transcriptome differences between young and mature leaves described in the current study provide crucial resources for gene annotation and discovery, and gene function analysis. Moreover, our sequencing results enhance understanding of biosynthesis of phenylpropanoid and cutin, and provide insights into the potential molecular mechanisms of pharmacological action in T. sinensis, which can promote production and yield of phenylpropanoid for medicinal or culinary purposes of T. sinensis.",

RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit (RS-122-2001, Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Buffer reagent was used to fragment the extracted mRNA, and the resulting fragmented mRNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA, with purified short fragments used for end repair and ligated with adaptors. The cDNA was enriched by PCR amplification and quality was confirmed with BioAnalyzer, after which RT-PCR was used to quantify the cDNA library, and it was sequenced (Illumina HiSeq\u2122 4000, BGI, Shenzhen, China), generating paired-end reads with 150 bp in length.",

This clean, high-quality data were used to calculate Q20 and Q30 values, levels of GC content and sequence duplication, and for all downstream analyses. The resulting paired-end reads were clustered using TGICL software (Pertea et al. 2003) to analyze the length and distribution of the transcriptional and unigene clusters. Paired-end sequences were separated into two files, \u201cleft\u201d reads into the \u201cleft.fq\u201d file and \u201cright\u201d reads into the \u201cright.fq\u201d file.

Unmatched reads at this stage of the process were considered a set of singleton reads and also placed into the right.fq file.

Then Blast2GO was employed to determine GO annotation against the GO database for unigenes annotated by NCBI Nr (nonredundant protein sequences) (Conesa et al. 2005; G\u00f6tz et al. 2008). InterProScan (v5) was used to give further protein annotation. Prediction of protein-coding regions was performed with OrfPredictor software (Min et al. 2005).

It analyzes gene expression based on a random sampling model or raw counts in Poisson distribution model. DEGseq can also be applied to identify differential expression of exons or pieces of transcripts with or without a small number of replicates. In our study, to get higher sequencing depth and detect subtle gene expression changes, we directly pooled 20 individual biological replicates together into YL and ML sample groups. Due to lack of replicates, DEGseq was more suitable than the other programs to conduct differential gene expression analysis. When we use DEGseq package, it will first homogenize the sample when analyzing single replicate (this homogenization process will avoid the biasness to some extent) according to the internal arithmetic method, and then we analyze the difference based on the data after homogenization instead of directly analyzing the difference between the original data input. To sort off reliable DEGs, the software accounting calculates the corresponding p value and corrected q value. In addition, DESeq detected DEGs based on the level of gene expression according to the negative binomial distribution of statistical methods. The obtained p value will be corrected to control false-positive results according to Benjamini and Hochberg methods. The corrected q value < 0.05 and |log2 (ratio)| \u2265 1 set as the thresholds is defined as DEGs.",

The resulting RNA-Seq data provided a high-quality annotated assembly for T. sinensis generated by comprehensive analysis. Distribution patterns annotated similarly across several databases indicated that YL and ML of T. sinensis undergo multiple unique developmental processes (Fig. 1; Supplemental Table 2). The large number of annotated enzymes suggests the presence of genes associated with different pathways of primary and secondary metabolite biosynthesis across life stages (Zhang et al. 2016; Zhao et al. 2017).",
