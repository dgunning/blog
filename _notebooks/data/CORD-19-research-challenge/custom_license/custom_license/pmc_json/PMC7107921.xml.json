The in-hospital mortality rate among statin recipients before admission was 10.6%, with a rate of mortality attributable to bacteremia of 6.1%; for patients who did not receive statins, the overall and attributable mortality rates were 23.1% and 18.3%, respectively. The differences favoring statin therapy were statistically significant with both comparisons. Furthermore, continuation of statin therapy during the hospitalization was associated with a further reduction in both overall and attributable mortality rates to 1.8%. Examination of 28-day mortality data confirmed these results. Multivariate analysis confirmed the protective effect of statin therapy.",

These results are also consistent with the demonstration that initiation of statin therapy after the development of experimental sepsis in mice was associated with improved survival [3]. The mechanism by which treatment with statins improves outcomes for sepsis remains uncertain, but the leading hypotheses relate to their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. At any rate, the clinical studies\u2014although they are all retrospective\u2014appear to have achieved weight sufficient to warrant a prospective study. In the meantime, although I may not be ready to initiate statin therapy for all patients with sepsis who were not previously receiving one of these agents, I will be making certain that statin therapy will be continued for those who are already receiving it.",

Additional study raised doubts about these conclusions. Li and colleagues have now found a high seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV recovered from feral horseshoe bats in China. Coronavirus genomes detected in bat feces were highly homologous with those of SARS-CoV, but their sequences demonstrated greater genetic diversity than did the sequences for virus isolated from humans or civets. These findings suggest that bats, rather than civets, are the natural reservoir of coronaviruses within the SARS cluster. Frugivorous bats, such as the horseshoe bat, spit out partially digested fruits, which may then be ingested by other species, such as civets. In this construct, civets would be accidental hosts but could serve as a bridge for transmission to humans.",

The resulting human loss has been tragic, and the devastation inflicted on chimpanzee and lowland gorilla populations has raised concerns about species extinction. Despite these recurring events, the natural reservoir of virus has remained unknown. Leroy and colleagues collected candidate animals from sites near infected chimpanzee and gorilla carcasses in Gabon and the Republic of Congo. They examined 679 bats, 222 birds, and 129 small terrestrial vertebrates and detected IgG antibody to Ebola antigens in 3 fruit bat species, with 16 (8.3%) of 192 bats being seropositive. Ebola nucleotide sequences were successfully amplified by PCR of liver and spleen specimens obtained from 13 (4.7%) of 279 other bats from the same populations. No Ebola virus RNA was detected in any of the other animal species tested. Ebola sequences were detected in none of the seropositive animals, while none of the animals with detectable viral sequences were seropositive. Other evidence suggested that the PCR-positive bats were too recently infected to have developed an IgG antibody response. The habitat ranges of the 3 implicated bat species include regions where outbreaks of Ebola infection in humans have occurred.",

Two members of the Paramyxoviridae, Hendra virus and Nipah virus, may also have bats as their reservoirs (flying foxes in the case of the latter) [5, 6]. Some evidence suggests that bats may also be associated with Marburg virus, which, like Ebola virus, is a filovirus [7]. Finally, as noted above, recent evidence also indicates that fruit bats are the natural reservoir of the SARS coronavirus.",

The latter would, of course, include either clarithromycin or azithromycin, which have anti-inflammatory effects of their own. My own opinion is that MAC causes an overlapping spectrum of illnesses in patients with exposures such as these, which involve presumed aerosol exposure.
