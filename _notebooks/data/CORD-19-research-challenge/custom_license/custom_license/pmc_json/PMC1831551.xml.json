The existing literature on the subject comprises studies on various diseases and, although it is claimed that experimental and clinical evidence supports the use of homeopathy in some situations (see, for example [11]), more than 200 years in practice have not rendered convincing proof of its efficacy.",

The study design in the trials is a matter of debate, e.g. in the reviews of clinical trials on homeopathic treatment of mastitis by [3] and [9]. Clinical trials on calves have been reported, e.g. by [8], who found no discernible differences between the treated and control groups in their manifestation of resistance to bovine lungworm or their clinical responses to the disease produced, by [10], who found no effect on calf health after homeopathic treatment of their dams with periparturient diseases, and by [4], who claimed effect on calf diarrhoea by Arsenicum album C30, although the results were not statistically valid. To make interpretation of results possible, trials need to be double-blind and placebo-controlled, and the use of relevant statistical analyses should be made. Currently it is difficult to assess the efficacy of homeopathy from the present literature [6], and therefore scientific evaluation of the effect of homeopathic treatment is required as a matter of urgency.",

Rotavirus infection, which is likely to affect clinical signs, was more commonly diagnosed in younger calves than in the older animals.
