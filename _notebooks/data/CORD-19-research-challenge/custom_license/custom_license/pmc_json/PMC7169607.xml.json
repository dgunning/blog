This strategy is used in the treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV, DNA virus with reverse transcription, Hepadnaviridae family) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, RNA virus with reverse transcription, Retroviridae family) infections.1 It seems especially attractive for viruses with RNA genomes, replicated by viral RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerases. These enzymes are unique for viruses, thus a superior selectivity with less side effects is achievable for nucleoside\u2010based antivirals targeting these enzymes. On the other hand, viral RNA polymerases are rather similar to each other, and it is highly possible that the same compound may inhibit several of them. Despite numerous nucleoside analogues being available, spectrum of their antiviral activity remains poorly studied, with most compounds non\u2010systematically tested against one or two viruses.",

The need for small molecule drugs against enteroviruses is justified by diversity of these viruses and ability to cause outbreaks, the range of syndromes they cause and increasing number of neuroinfections with severe CNS damage, such as poliomyelitis, encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, and acute flaccid myelitis.2 High variability of enteroviral antigens prohibits development of a universal anti\u2010enteroviral vaccine, and more conserved replication machinery opens the possibility to create pan\u2010enteroviral drugs.2 Several dozens of enterovirus serotypes are grouped into the genus Enterovirus: species Enterovirus A to D and Rhinovirus A to C include human pathogens. According to our searches in ChEMBL database, containing annotated biological activity data for more than 1.3 million compounds,3 2406 different compounds were tested against at least one enterovirus, but only 32 of them were simultaneously assessed against Enterovirus A, Enterovirus B, and Enterovirus C species representatives. These 32 compounds interact with capsid proteins,4 host targets,5 or 3C protease6 and do not contain nucleoside\u2010like scaffolds. Although literature coverage by ChEMBL is not comprehensive, systematic studies of nucleoside antiviral activity against different enteroviruses are sporadic and do not show a consistent picture.",

Compound 3, N\n4\u2010hydroxycytidine (NHC), on the contrary, revealed itself as a pan\u2010enterovirus reproduction inhibitor with a preference for coxsackieviruses independently of the enterovirus species assignment. Nevertheless, this compound did not inhibit TBEV reproduction at 50 \u03bcM concentration. In the previous studies NHC was shown to inhibit the replication of viruses with various genomes and replication cycles: (+)ssRNA genomic bovine viral diarrhea (BVDV) and hepatitis C (HCV) viruses, both belonging to Flaviviridae family,15 severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2010associated coronavirus,16 norovirus,17 chikungunya virus;18 (\u2010)ssRNA genomic Ebola virus,19 and DNA genomic vaccinia, monkeypox, and cowpox viruses (family Poxviridae).20 However, it is not active against HIV\u20101, hepatitis B virus, and herpes simplex viruses.15 Such a profile of antiviral activity suggests that this compound may target host proteins, as well as viral ones.

Significant reduction of virus yields in the schemes D, E, and F suggests that NHC targets the stages of reproduction that occur after entry, i. e., replication and/or virion assembly, and does not prevent viral entry.

These compounds were previously assessed for inhibition of reproduction of HCV and BVDV (RNA viruses, Flaviviridae family).9 The only active compound in these assays was 9, with EC50 of 1.9 \u03bcM against BVDV and moderate HCV inhibition at 100 \u03bcM, without inhibition of RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase NS5B and RNA helicase NS3. Analogues with alkyn\u20101\u2010yl tails were tested against varicella zoster virus and human cytomegalovirus (DNA viruses, Herpesvirales order), and the most potent ones had C10 and C12 tails.21 For non\u2010enveloped RNA genomic enteroviruses an optimal chain length for alkyl also exists: compounds 7 and 8 with C5 and C6 alkyls are the only active ones, and elongation (9) or removal (6) of the chain lead to inactivity. This pattern also suggests that activity is unlikely to be attributed to the detergent properties of the molecule, given that only viruses belonging to Enterovirus A species, EVA71 and CVA16, are susceptible to these compounds. Such species selectivity profile was also observed for other classes of hydrophobic nucleosides, e. g., N\n6\u2010substituted adenosines [A. A. Orlov, V. E. Oslovsky, S. N. Mikhailov, L. I. Kozlovskaya, D. I. Osolodkin, manuscript in preparation]. This selectivity may be attributed to sequence differences of replication machinery proteins on the species level.22\n",

It is worth noting that the toxicity level itself is much lower for furano[2, 3\u2010d]pyrimidine nucleosides than for N\n6\u2010benzyladenosine, and it opens the way for the further design of more potent congeners keeping the same low toxicity.",

Structure of this compound falls into the same line with so\u2010called rigid amphipathic fusion inhibitors (RAFI, 11, Figure 1), typical representatives of which differ from 10 in hydrophobic moiety: instead of a long alkyl, an ethynyl connects a perylenyl moiety to uracil in RAFIs.12,23 RAFI mechanism of action is supposed to realize through the incorporation of the perylene moiety into the viral membrane leading to membrane fusion prevention due to the shape restrictions or singlet oxygen production.24 Incorporation of a flexible linker between perylene and nucleoside (11 b) instead of ethynyl (11 a) in our previous studies led to EC50 drop from two\u2010digit nanomolar values to micromolar ones.12 Change or even removal of nucleoside moiety does not impair activity of RAFIs, but substitution of perylene by phenyl (11 c) or 2\u2010pyrenyl (11 d) does.23 Compound 10 does not contain a perylene core, bearing a C12 n\u2010alkyl instead, and it shows slightly lower activity than RAFI with the flexible linker, justifying again the importance of perylene fragment. Activity profile of compounds 7\u20139 against TBEV, HCV, and BVDV (all Flaviviridae family), suggests that the ability of a compound to incorporate into the viral membrane does not guarantee antiviral activity of the compound, and the geometry of nucleoside head is important for alkylated nucleosides. Similar peculiarities were already observed for anti\u2010TBEV activity of N\n6\u2010substituted adenosines with hydrophobic substituents,8 where introduction of alkyls did not lead to the inhibition of viral reproduction, whereas large aryls (12) positively affected the activity.\n",
