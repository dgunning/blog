            "text": "The avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), is a highly infectious pathogen of domestic fowl and like other coronaviruses is an enveloped virus that replicates in the cell cytoplasm and contains a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of 28 kb for IBV. Molecular analysis of the role of individual genes in pathogenesis of RNA viruses has been advanced by the availability of full-length cDNAs, for the generation of infectious RNA transcripts that can replicate and result in infectious viruses. The assembly of full-length coronavirus cDNAs was hampered owing to regions from the replicase gene being unstable in bacteria. We therefore devised a reverse genetics strategy for IBV involving insertion of the full-length cDNA, under the control of a T7 RNA promoter, into the vaccinia virus genome. This is followed by the in situ recovery of infectious IBV in cells transfected with the vaccinia virus DNA and infected with a recombinant fowlpox virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase (1).",

            "text": "An advantage of using vaccinia virus, in addition to the stability of the IBV cDNA, is the ability to generate modified IBV cDNAs by homologous recombination for the subsequent rescue of recombinant IBVs (rIBVs). We use the vaccinia virus-based transient dominant selection (TDS) recombination method (2) for modifying the IBV cDNA sequence within the vaccinia virus genome (3\u20135). The method relies on a three-step procedure. In the first step, the modified IBV cDNA is inserted into a plasmid containing a selective marker under the control of a vaccinia virus promoter. In our case we use a plasmid, pGPTNEB193 [Fig.\n1; (6)], which contains a dominant selective marker gene, Escherichia coli guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Ecogpt; (7)), under the control of the vaccinia virus P7.5 K early/late promoter. In the second step, the complete plasmid sequence, containing a region of the IBV cDNA to be modified, is integrated into the IBV sequence in the vaccinia virus genome (Fig.\n2). This occurs as a result of a single crossover event involving homologous recombination between the IBV cDNA in the plasmid and the IBV cDNA sequence in the vaccinia virus genome. Recombinant vaccinia viruses (rVV) expressing the Ecogpt gene are selected for resistance against mycophenolic acid (MPA) in the presence of xanthine and hypoxanthine. In the third step, the MPA-resistant rVVs are grown in the absence of MPA selection, resulting in loss of the Ecogpt gene owing to a single homologous recombination event between duplicated sequences, present in the vaccinia virus genome resulting from integration of the plasmid sequence (Fig.\n3). During the third step two recombination events can occur, each of them with equal frequency. One event will result in the generation of the original (unmodified) IBV sequence and the other in the generation of an IBV cDNA containing the desired modification.\u2666\n\n\n\n",

Total RNA is extracted from the P1 to P3 CK cells and analyzed for the presence of IBV RNA by specific RT-PCR reactions (see\nNote 8). For passage 1 (P1):\nSeed CK cells in T25 flasks to be confluent monolayers on the day required.Remove the growth medium and wash once with PBSa.Add 1 ml of the filtered medium from the P0 CK cells (Section 3.11, step 7) to the confluent CK cells and incubate at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 for 1 h. Then, without removing the inoculum add 4 ml of BES medium.Check the cells for IBV-associated CPE over the next 2\u20133 days. When about 50\u201375% of the CK cells show a CPE, infect new cells with some of the cell medium as described in steps 1 to 3. Repeat for serial passages P2 and P3 CK cells. Filtration of the infected cell medium is not required after P1.After P3 any recovered virus is used to prepare a large stock for analysis of the virus genotype and phenotype.\n",

A paper towel should be put on the bottom of the boxes to absorb any possible spillage.During centrifugation of vaccinia virus infected cells use sealed buckets for the centrifugation to avoid possible spillage.Vaccinia virus DNA is a very large molecule that is very easy to shear; therefore when working with the DNA be gentle and use wide bore tips, cutting the ends off ordinary pipette tips.Always store vaccinia virus DNA at 4\u00b0C; do not freeze the DNA as this leads to degradation of the DNA.1% low-melting agarose can be substituted with 1% agar.There is always the possibility that the recovered rIBV is not cytopathic. In this case, check for the presence of viral RNA by RT-PCR at each passage, starting at P1.\n",

The second single-step recombination event is induced in the absence of MPA; loss of selection allows the unstable intermediate to lose one of the tandem repeat sequences including the Ecogpt gene. The second step recombination event can result in either: (I) the original sequence of the input vaccinia virus IBV cDNA sequence, in this case shown as a recombination event between the two copies of the 3\u2032-end of the replicase gene, which results in loss of the modified S gene sequence along with Ecogpt gene; or (II) retention of the modified S gene sequence and loss of the original S gene sequence and Ecogpt gene as a result of a potential recombination event between the two copies of the 5\u2032-end of the S gene sequence.
