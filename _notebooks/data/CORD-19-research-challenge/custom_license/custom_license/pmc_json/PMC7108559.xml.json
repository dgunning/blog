            "text": "Since the early 1990s, it has become increasingly apparent that there is a growing need for a wide range of biocontainment facilities that are properly designed to accommodate animals safely for infectious disease research. Since the 1980s, several countries, including Australia, the Netherlands, and Canada, have built state-of-the-art biological containment laboratories (Murray 1998); and the United States has embarked on a major regional construction program for new biocontainment laboratories. The defection of senior Soviet scientists Vladimir Pasechnik and Kanatjan Alibekov, and subsequent revelations of the Soviet research programs on biological weapons, awakened the world to the need for more research into biological defense (Albeck 1998). The events of September 11, 2001, and anthrax-related terrorism have changed the entire focus of many governments, especially the United Kingdom and the United States, as defense and homeland security have become an important focus of government funding agencies (Baker et al. 2004; BRA 2002; NIAID 2002). These events illustrated many weaknesses within the biological defense policies of governments, including prevention, diagnosis, disinfection, emergency response, and security planning (BRA 2002; NIAID 2002).",

The need was accentuated by long-term severe underfunding of biological containment facilities in the United States and around the world, which led to a huge deficiency in biocontainment infrastructure capacity that was incapable of meeting the growing demand. Constructed in the late 20th century, the facilities generally lacked in space and quickly became overwhelmed with projects. The deficit was most marked in the higher levels of biological containment, specifically Canadian containment levels (CLs1)-3 and -4 (BRA 2002) and US biosafety containment levels (BSLs1)-3 and -4 (NIAID 2002).",

It is important to note that each agent may require different research and animal facility characteristics. A variety of standards must be met in the design and operation of these facilities, which can be quite challenging and must include current and emerging construction guidelines and regulations. Pressure comes not only from government agencies for more accountability, but also from commercial companies vying for the profits of biodefense products. Facilities must also comply with new, existing, and increasingly rigorous and changing standards to qualify for certificates of good laboratory practices, good manufacturing practices, or quality assurance programs such as the International Organisation for Standards.",

The legal requirements for permits and acquisition of the newest strain of the organism can be problematic. The research facility and animal housing space must be certified for use of the infectious agent. Permits can take months, if not years, if regulatory agencies are overwhelmed with work or if existing regulations no longer apply. In Canada, for example, it is necessary to fulfill both a Health Standard and a Veterinary Standard, which are similar but not exactly the same. This is also the case in the United States, where there can be differences between, for example, Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (Richmond and McKinney 1999) and US Department of Agriculture (USDA/APHIS 1999) standards. These standards and other guidelines (e.g., CCAC 1984, 1993; NRC 1996) have been developed over the years as a result of much discussion among scientists, and considering the interests of the public, the scientist, the research staff, and the animals. Naturally, this necessary process may seem cumbersome to the scientist wanting to perform research.",

            "text": "The needs of the scientist may be vastly different from those of the research animal model criteria. The basic goal for most scientists is the observation or sample required to achieve the objective of the research. Samples and procedures must be scientifically and statistically justified, reviewed, and approved in the initial planning phases. Animal infectious disease models often require frequent sampling, which can engender debate with institutional animal care and use committees. A thorough knowledge of the laws and guidelines of each country, coupled with in-depth justification for the frequency, nature, and volume of samples, will help with this review process. Facing uncertainty with limited knowledge of a newly emerged organism, as well as the uncertainty of working with agents in new or unproven animal models for which the behavior of the agent may be unpredictable, can also challenge the scientist to devise with a working protocol. A mechanism must also be in place to ensure rapid access to animals in the face of an outbreak of a serious human or animal pathogen. Standing approved protocols can allow an animal care committee to review the document before the animals are required.",

Research on the agents of tuberculosis, AI, SARS, and other respiratory diseases may require nasal or aerosol challenge; others such as WNV may require intravenous inoculation, and intracranial inoculation is common with agents such as prions. Each route and agent requires different animal care facilities, SOPs, training of personnel, and personal protection equipment. When working with scrapie in hamsters, for example, it is important to develop SOPs before the work is undertaken to satisfy the permitting agencies, local animal care committees, local safety officers, and animal care staff. The detail requirements may include a description of a calibrated injector, gauge of needle, requirement for general gaseous anesthesia (including safety associated with the anesthetic agent), and personal protection.",

Most commonly, infectious disease research requires mucosal surface swabs, blood, and tissues. To accomplish these tasks, it is often necessary to develop novel approaches or search the literature for methodology. The \u201cholistic\u201d sampling method\u2014a request for everything from everywhere at every point in time\u2014is common. In CL-3 and -4, the personal safety requirements for protective equipment will affect the ability of the individual to obtain samples. Some sampling procedures may be considered too risky to perform; it is always important to keep the time factor in mind. For example, to take one blood sample from one pig will take about 15 min in a level 2 animal facility, 30 min at level 3 (including the time it takes to don and doff protective equipment and shower out), and 1 hr at level 4 because of the need to check all systems, change, get suited, restrain the animal, have a chemical shower, remove the suit and shower out. Therefore, the general rule is as the CL level increases, the number of procedures and frequency of sampling should decrease. It may be necessary to replace full necropsies with a preselected set of samples.",

Scientists enjoy overseeing experiments and dropping in to ensure that the project is proceeding well. To do so, the scientist, and even the director, must be adequately trained in high-containment safety procedures to be in the room with the animals. Initial training can take years, and all procedures that will be carried out must be reviewed, practiced, and discussed to ensure that safety is not compromised, even by these scientific observers.",

            "text": "Once the sample is taken from the animals, it is important to have planned where the sample will be manipulated and how it will be treated before the samples leave the animal room. First, the scientist must remember that removal of samples must follow the local, regional, and national biological safety regulations, as well as the guidelines for the transport of dangerous goods. Second, it may be necessary for the sample to be treated before it is removed from a higher level of containment to a lower level. For example, serum from CL-3 is frequently gamma irradiated at 2 mega rads to remove any possible contaminating pathogens. The irradiation can alter the protein configuration, which may negate its usefulness for analyzing antibody or antigen in the native configuration. Third, it may be necessary to fix samples in formalin for a length of time before they are eligible for removal, and the analysis will be unavoidably delayed. All staff, including animal care staff, must be aware in advance of how the samples are to be processed. Photographs and video clips of animals exhibiting signs or lesions of infectious diseases are extremely useful and easily accomplished. High-quality publishable digital pictures can be produced within 1 day and can be sent to as many sites as required.",

If sharps are used, it is critical to know the location of all staff, as well as the sharps container; constant control is vital to maintain a safe working environment. The use of sharps should be limited to a select few highly trained, highly experienced individuals to minimize potential accidents. Exposure can also be decreased by continuous improvement and review of procedures to eliminate the use of any sharp. For example, the elimination of use of a scalpel in favor of blunt scissors during a necropsy procedure greatly enhances safety. However, not all modifications can be adopted. Vanish PointTM needles can be used for injections; the needle retracts into the barrel of the syringe. For small animals that do not move, the use of these needles increases safety. However, if larger animals move, Vanish PointTM needles may bend or break more easily than conventional needles and cannot be retracted, decreasing the safety of the procedure. Vacutainer bleeding systems are used for both large and small animal bleeding techniques. The availability of sharps containers for the removal of the needle sharps will allow the staff member to dispose of the needle without handling the needle hub or fumbling when removing the needle from the holder. Alternatively, the entire needle and holder can be discarded.",

The building design frequently dictates how the animals can be housed, what kinds of animals can be used, and what kind of environment they can live in. Buildings with inadequate design for certain types of animals simply cannot be used for those animals despite the desire of the scientist. When designing an animal facility, it is important to consult with a wide range of experts, and it is vital to solicit input from the animal care staff. Only animals that are of the highest quality and free of adventitious pathogens should be used in high-containment facilities. The cost of operating a high-containment facility on a daily basis far exceeds the extra cost of quality animals. The facility must always yield the highest quality of results. Rodents, for example, should be selected for infectious disease studies based on a complete health profile, which includes serological panels and analysis for pathogenic parasites, fungi, and bacteria. When possible, it is beneficial to use calm strains that are noted for ease of handling, rather than strains known to bite or that are intractable. All animals must be properly acclimated to the high air flows, room temperature, feed, lighting regimes, and noise.",

For example, the volume of manure an adult cow generates is not the same as an adult mouse. It may be necessary to increase the frequency of cleaning or to keep the stocking density to a minimum to accommodate the volume of feces produced. The type of infectious disease agent also affects the requirement regarding treatment or sterilization of the waste. In Canada, the effluent human CL-3 from a facility may be treated directly within the laboratory, whereas an agricultural CL-3 pathogen requires secondary effluent treatment (CSVF 1996; Murray 1998). Most agricultural animals are governed separately if they are inoculated with CL-3 agricultural agents such as foot and mouth disease, classical swine fever, and capripox. Pretreatment of large volumes of organic material with disinfectants such as sodium hypochlorite, Virkon\u00ae, or iodine-containing compounds is widely advocated, but difficult to justify scientifically. It is well known that organic matter decreases or inactivates many disinfectants (Vesley et al. 2000). Heat and pressure in cookers provide one of the best methods of treating organic material (Edwards et al. 2002; Murray 1998).",

One SPF goat, for example, can cost up to $5,000 Canadian, but may be necessary for polyclonal antibody production destined for humans. Prior acclimation in conventional housing or a farm will decrease the amount of time for the animals to be housed in containment. It is possible to decrease certain acclimation periods from 2 to 3 wk to 1 wk, which increases annual program output. For example, nonhuman primates can be tested for tuberculosis while being acclimated to new caging systems, feed, cage mates, and personnel before they enter the high-containment area. Sheep can be shorn, dewormed, vaccinated, acclimated to pelleted feed or hay cubes, and treated for parasites. Furthermore, this period can be used to assess the temperment of larger animals, and thus their suitability, for use in the containment facility.",

Providing soft rubber mats for large animals is common; however, animals tend to defecate on the mat and become soiled and uncomfortable. Rubber inlaid flooring that contains channels will decrease but not eliminate soiling while providing a drier place for the animal to rest. It is important to keep in mind that large adult animals such as pigs can chew through rubber flooring. Tie stalls can successfully restrain the animal while the manure is channeled away, and soft rubber mats can provide comfort for the animals.

Animal nails, teeth, beaks, and horns should be considered sharps. Each species must be considered individually and the peculiarities understood. For example, mice can be manipulated with forceps, avoiding any contact with the animal, whereas this procedure would be impossible for Syrian hamsters, which have no tail. It is possible to move hamsters easily from one area to another by using a strainer. Rats and guinea pigs require the animal care staff to pick up the animals physically when moving between areas or cages. Armored (Figure 1) or Kevlar\u00ae (Figure 2) gloves can keep the individual staff member safe, but have the disadvantage of being bulky (Table 1).

Most CL-3 agricultural agents are not zoonotic and require only rubber boots, coveralls, and gloves. Zoonotic CL-3 and human CL-3 pathogens require extra protection, especially when necropsies are performed. When working in an infected large animal room, all staff should consider themselves to be in the biological safety cabinet with the organism. Commonly, hip waders and plastic rain coats (Figure 3) cover the pathologist so they can be rinsed and disinfected after the procedure. Within large animal facilities, the hoses and HEPA filter unit can be damaged by the pens, animals, and fellow workers.",

A veterinary pathologist completed the necropsy and selected the tissue samples. The scientist ensured that all samples were taken and placed in the appropriate containers, and transferred them to the high-containment laboratory. The laboratory technician immediately performed the tests as well as preserved and catalogued the samples.",

The paradigm has served well for the basic concept involved in building new animal facilities and working within existing facilities. Many papers, guidelines, and excellent references are available that describe requirements within the animal room. Briefly, the floors, walls, and ceilings must be impervious to water, and easily cleaned and sterilized. Epoxy-covered cement is the most common example. HEPA filtration of the exhaust air is essential, and high flow rates up to 20 air exchanges per hour are common. Frequently, noise can become a problem because the baffling of incoming air is expensive and often omitted unless considered essential by the animal care staff who will work in the area. Ante-rooms provide a high degree of safety and an area to don, doff, and store essential safety equipment. If the ante-room is not big enough for highly infectious agents, adjacent rooms and return hallways can provide large areas for safe decontamination and removal of equipment.",

In short, it forces staff to change clothing to prevent the spread of organisms. (2) Exit showers provide a mechanism to help remove any pathogen on the surface of the body. (3) The showers prevent quick access, which can lead to circumvention of safety protocols; and finally (4) showers refresh the staff members after a long experimental procedure.",

The requirements of modern HVAC systems are more centralized and highly dependent on computers and computer software (Murray 1998). Lighting, heating, and air flow all are governed by staff not directly within the high-containment facility. When the containment areas run smoothly, there are few problems. Minor problems can be analyzed with the data presented to management and regulatory bodies in an efficient manner. However, local input into the system is essential when obvious problems occur at the room level that may even register as normal in the computer. Safety can be compromised if the staff member is not taken seriously or the problem cannot be quickly solved. Containment facilities have been designed where the CL-4 animal holding area is controlled both locally and centrally, adding a second level of confidence in the system while allowing the input of the end user into the HVAC systems functioning (Abraham et al. 2002).",
