The unusual \u201catypical\u201d pneumonia, subsequently called \u201csevere acute respiratory syndrome\u201d (SARS), that emerged out of southern China in late 2002 was not caused by influenza, but was, in fact, caused by a novel coronavirus [1\u20133]. Epidemiologically, infection with the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is closely linked with SARS [1, 4], and experimental infection of cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) results in pathology reminiscent of the human disease [4, 5]. Human coronaviruses 229E and OC43 are known to be causes of the common cold and have received scant attention, either diagnostically or research wise, in the past few decades. Coronaviruses also cause disease in animals that varies from transmissible gastroenteritis in pigs, to feline infectious peritonitis in cats, to avian infectious bronchitis in chickens. However, phylogenetic relationships suggested that this new virus was not closely related to any of the previously known human or animal coronaviruses and that SARS-CoV may, in fact, be the first representative of a new group within the coronavirus family [6, 7]. The lack of serological evidence of prior SARS-CoV infection in the healthy population in many parts of the world, including regions where the disease outbreaks were the most severe, suggested that this was a virus that had recently entered the human population, presumably from an animal reservoir [1, 8]. Although the animal reservoir in nature remains to be defined, the recent isolation of SARS-CoV\u2013like virus from small mammals in live wild-game animal markets in southern China confirmed the zoonotic origin of the virus and suggested that these markets could potentially be the interface where the inter-species jump from animals to humans occurs [9].",

Detection of seroconversion to SARS-CoV using immunofluorescence and well-validated ELISA tests has been a very reliable means for confirming the diagnosis. However, the antibody response appears only around day 10 of the illness, and, in some patients, it may take even longer [12]. Thus, serological testing still remains the means for retrospective diagnosis. To date, IgM or other subtype assays have not been useful for closing the diagnostic window within the first week of illness, although future research and development may improve matters. Virus culture is still insensitive, and, in any event, primary virus isolation takes too long to be clinically relevant. Options such as shell vial culture may be considerations in the future, when monoclonal antibody reagents become available. However, given the current recommendation that culture of SARS-CoV be restricted to biosafety level 3 containment, culture-based diagnostic techniques are unlikely to be widely available. Conventional RT-PCR and recently established real-time PCR technologies have been reported to detect this deadly virus in patients with SARS [1\u20133, 13\u201317].",

Specimens obtained from the lower respiratory tract, including sputum samples [2], endotracheal aspirates [8], and bronchial lavage fluid, are excellent specimens for detection of SARS-CoV. However, few patients expectorate sputum during the early stage of the illness. Somewhat surprisingly, viral RNA was also detected in feces and urine samples, although urine was not the most sensitive specimen at any stage of the illness [8]. The suitability of serum or peripheral blood leukocytes as a diagnostic specimen remains to be examined. With the first-generation RT-PCR tests, the overall diagnostic yield in the second week of illness was >80%, and feces specimens yielded better results than did respiratory specimens [8]. By use of quantitative assays, it was shown that the virus load in the upper respiratory tract is low during the first week of illness and peaks around day 10 of illness [12]. Thus, in the first 5 days of illness, none of these specimens gave a satisfactory diagnostic yield, and it was clear that the low virus load at this stage of illness posed a diagnostic challenge. This may be partly because the virus targets the lower rather than the upper respiratory tract [10, 11]. In any event, when tests for diagnosis of SARS are compared, it is important to characterize specimens in relation to the duration of illness.",

[18] describe a real-time nested PCR method for detection of SARS-CoV. With their assay, cDNA obtained from a throat swab sample was subjected sequentially to 2 rounds of amplification in a real-time quantitative PCR platform. The test is able to detect <10 copies of viral genome per reaction. Although only a small number of samples were evaluated, the assay seems to be more sensitive than a commercial, single-round RT-PCR kit. Discrepant results were all validated by serological testing, which demonstrated the specificity of their assay. The assay has a dynamic range from at least 103 to 1 copies per reaction and no detectable background signal from negative control samples. More importantly, the turn-around time for this method was much shorter than that for the conventional nested RT-PCR assay. However, the actual sensitivity and specificity of this method remains to be evaluated with a study involving a larger number of clinical specimens.",

Because of the presence of a large amount of subgenomic viral mRNA in infected cells, one would expect that the detection rate of SARS-CoV might be increased by targeting subgenomic viral mRNA [6, 7]. To explore this possibility, with some colleagues, we recently compared the amounts of genomic and subgenomic RNA in clinical specimens [15]. To our surprise, our results indicated that genomic viral RNA is the predominant viral RNA species in clinical samples, suggesting that there is no advantage in targeting subgenomic mRNA sequences for clinical diagnosis [15].",

A nasopharyngeal aspirate specimen (rather than a throat swab specimen) must be used in this assay for optimal results. Obtainment of nasopharyngeal aspirates or nasopharyngeal swab specimens from patients with SARS has sometimes been a cause for concern. However, with appropriate precautions, the procedures can be done safely, and these specimens are the best for the rapid diagnosis of infection with alternative pathogens, such as influenza virus, which are more likely to be the etiological agent in many suspected outbreaks of infection that are investigated during this winter season. Recently, Tsang et al. [16] demonstrated that positive RT-PCR results for nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were independent predictors of mortality, implying that virus loads might also be very useful for prognosis. Thus, quantitative RT-PCR assays may provide useful information for clinical management.",
