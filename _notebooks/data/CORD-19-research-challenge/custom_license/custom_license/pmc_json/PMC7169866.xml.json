Viral pneumonia was defined as a positive RV PCR result from throat/nasopharyngeal swab or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) with a new infiltrate on chest imaging (taken 7 days before and up to 7 days after the positive RV PCR). A patient initially presenting with viral URTI and subsequently developing pneumonia was defined as progression to pneumonia, if no other cause could be found for the progression. However, if a bacterial or fungal co\u2010pathogen was isolated from respiratory samples, or if other laboratory or clinical evidence was suggestive of active bacterial or fungal infection (eg, a positive blood culture), then the progression was not attributed to the RVI.

Indeed, the group that developed the ISI\u2010RSV has found that it is similarly useful when applied to allo\u2010HSCT patients with influenza.15 We have now, with our modest number of patients with AdV (n=11) and HPIV (n=28) RVI, observed a similar pattern for these two viruses as well.",

HRhV are the commonest cause of the common cold,19 as well as the most common virus found in allo\u2010HSCT recipients.6, 7, 18 Milano et al.18 calculated the cumulative incidence of HRhV to be 22% at 100 days after allo\u2010HSCT. In these studies, HRhV infections were only infrequently associated with pneumonia. On the other hand, Ghosh et al.20 described 22 HSCT recipients who developed HRhV infection in the pre\u2010engraftment period, among whom 7 developed pneumonia and all 7 died. Ison et al.21 found that HRhV detected in the BAL fluid of HSCT recipients was associated with a high rate of co\u2010infection and mortality. In our series, 9 episodes of HRhV pneumonia and 2 deaths occurred within 6 weeks of the HRhV pneumonia, amid other transplant complications. A similar profile was observed for HCoV, with pneumonia seen in 6 of 19 cases, including 2 episodes that required mechanical ventilation.

As for RSV, RSV pneumonia in allo\u2010HSCT recipients is associated with significant mortality,3, 4, 5, 24 and a systematic review concluded that ribavirin (aerosolized, oral, or intravenous) was probably beneficial.25 Our data failed to show that early treatment (within 3 days of a positive PCR result) could prevent progression to pneumonia. However, this could be a result of selection bias, as all the untreated patients were outpatients who were very well and some had had symptoms for many days. The use of oral, as opposed to aerosolized, ribavirin which is unavailable locally, could be the cause of failure to prevent progression.",

Nosocomial viral infections are known to occur in HSCT units. The rather large percentages of nosocomial HPIV (32.14%) and AdV cases (63.64%) reflect the outbreaks with these two viruses that we had in 2012 and 2013, respectively. It is gratifying that only one case of influenza (3.85%) was of nosocomial origin, possibly owing to the annual influenza vaccination that all hospital staff receive. Nevertheless, the nosocomial rate might be lower if we had easier access to single rooms for our patients. Because of a shortage of single rooms, we reserve positively pressured single rooms only for patients undergoing transplantation and those who are neutropenic.",
