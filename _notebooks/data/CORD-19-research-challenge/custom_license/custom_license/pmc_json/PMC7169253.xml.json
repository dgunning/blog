            "text": "The diagnosis of FIP should be based on a combination of clinical and laboratory findings.2 The analysis of effusions is useful to support a clinical diagnosis of FIP or, conversely, a different disease and rule out FIP from the list of differential diagnoses.1, 5, 18 FIP, in contrast to other diseases, is characterized by protein\u2010rich effusions17, 18 containing a large amount of globulins, particularly \u03b3\u2010globulins7, 19 and fibrinogen.5 It is the latter 2 that react with acidic solution in the Rivalta's test and visibly clot in the tube. Recently, the Rivalta's test has been found to be highly diagnostic for FIP, although, as any other test, its specificity and sensitivity are not 100%.9 In the present study, it was investigated whether cell counts performed in the laser\u2010based Sysmex XT\u20102000iV that has the so\u2010called BASO channel in which cells are counted after precipitation in an acidic reagent provide diagnostic information similar to the Rivalta's test. This was suggested by a previous study that, however, included only a few specimens of effusions from cats with FIP.11 In our study, we had the opportunity to investigate a larger number of cats with or without FIP. Very stringent inclusion criteria for the FIP group granted for a very well\u2010defined positive study population. Unfortunately, the \u201cnon\u2010FIP\u201d group was composed largely of neoplastic effusions that were not as challenging for a differential diagnosis from FIP, as the 2 conditions may be easily differentiated by cytology. Therefore, a possible limitation of this study is the low number of nonneoplastic effusions that in routine practice may benefit from an additional test to distinguish FIP from other types of inflammatory or reactive effusions. However, also in the previous feline effusions study11, all the specimens from cats with inflammatory effusions other than FIP had a \u0394TNC < 1, confirming that a \u0394TNC > 1 has a high diagnostic accuracy for FIP.",

            "text": "The results of the current study confirmed that the instrumental analysis with the Sysmex XT\u20102000iV may represent an additional reliable method for confirmation of FIP in the analysis of effusions. Specifically, as cells are entrapped in clots formed by fibrinogen precipitation in the BASO channel, cell counts in the BASO channel (BASO\u2010TNCC) are usually lower than those of the DIFF channel. This mechanism explains why the \u0394TNC (in the Sysmex referred to as \u0394WBC) increases in such specimens. Based on our results, \u0394TNC has a high diagnostic accuracy for FIP, which was supported by sensitivity and specificity > 90% and the ROC curve. Specifically, with a positive likelihood ratio close to 14, a \u0394TNC > 1.7 makes it 14 times more likely that an effusion originates from a cat with FIP rather than a different disease. Conversely, a negative likelihood ratio of 0.11 suggests that with a \u0394TNC < 1.7, the probability that the effusion comes from a cat with FIP is about one\u2010tenth of the probability that the effusion comes from a cat with a different disease.",

            "text": "The specificity is 100% with \u0394TNC > 2.5, a value that was ultimately found in all FIP effusions except the 2 atypical cases. Specifically, the effusion in one cat with hypoalbuminemia and a hemorrhagic syndrome was classified as a transudate.20 All these changes are consistent with liver failure that may induce also hypofibrinogenemia, likely preventing clotting in the BASO reagent. In the other case, the cytologic pattern of the effusion was complicated by the presence of \u201catypical\u201d mesothelial cells that are usually less abundant in FIP effusions than neutrophils and lymphocytes. However, this may represent a feature typical for pericardial effusions, often leading to a misdiagnosis of neoplasia.17 Therefore, in both cases, the false\u2010negative results of \u0394TNC may be related to atypical features of the effusion rather than the low analytic sensitivity. As regards specificity, only 2 false\u2010positive results were found; one lymphoma case, which in people sometimes provides positive Rivalta's test results10, possibly due to the presence of fibrinogen associated with an inflammatory reaction against the tumor itself, and one case with a poorly cellular fluid, in which the high \u0394TNC was clearly a mathematical artifact due to analytical sensitivity of the instrument. However, both these cases do not represent a diagnostic challenge in routine practice as FIP may be easily excluded if additional investigations such as cytology of effusions are added to the diagnostic workup. Independently on these few cases, the analysis of effusions with the Sysmex\u2010XT2000iV counter evidenced a sensitivity and a specificity comparable to or even higher than that previously reported for the Rivalta's test9, likely because the mechanisms are very similar. The Rivalta's test is rapid, cheap, and accurate, but it may be limited due to some preanalytic or analytic factors. For example, the test may be inaccurate due to inappropriate techniques or intrinsic factors of the reagents such as concentration of acetic acid, different temperatures of the effusion, and the acetic acid solution. Moreover, the reaction may be negative when pH increased to 4.6 or higher.8, 10 Additionally, the Rivalta's test provides semi\u2010quantitative results (negative, weakly or strongly positive) and does not allow grading the severity of the change. Finally, the evaluation of the test is subjective and no information about inter\u2010observer variability is currently available. Conversely, the analysis with the Sysmex\u2010XT2000iV counter is more standardized in terms of reagents, although the repeatability study demonstrated that, limited to FIP effusions, it may suffer from a poor precision which however did not affect the interpretation of the results, as \u0394TNC was always > 1.0. Moreover, the test is rapid and, in one single measurement, provides information on the presence of precipitable proteins, and a provisional information on the cell types based on the scattergram11 in addition to the cell count. However, it must be stressed that the linearity under dilution test performed in this study demonstrated that the more accurate cell count provided by the instrument is the DIFF\u2010TNCC that is not affected by the entrapment of cells in the clots formed after contact with the BASO reagent. Therefore, in routine practice, it is not recommended to use the default WBC counts that are generated by the BASO channel. Conversely, when FIP is clinically suspected, it may be recommended to directly check the results of the DIFF\u2010TNCC and the \u0394TNC that are reported in the Service screenshot of the software. Moreover, in future studies, it may be interesting to assess whether other laser\u2010based instruments such as those of the ADVIA series that use a similar analytic principle to count basophils in peripheral blood14 provide the same interesting results on FIP effusions.",

This depends on the formation of clots in the BASO reagent that entrap the cells, similarly to what occurs in the Rivalta's test that has also been reported to have a high diagnostic accuracy for FIP. This reaction leads to a low BASO\u2010TNCC even when DIFF\u2010TNCC counts are high. Therefore, in routine practice, it is not recommended to use the default TNCC counts generated by the BASO channel, but to directly use the DIFF\u2010TNCC and especially the \u0394TNC, particularly when FIP is suspected. In these cases, a \u0394TNC > 1.7 is highly suggestive of FIP, and a \u0394TNC > 3.4 may be considered diagnostic for FIP.",
