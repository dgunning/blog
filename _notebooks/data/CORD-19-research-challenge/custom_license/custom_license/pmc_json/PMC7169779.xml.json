            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) was described for the first time in England in 1971, and some PED cases have been identified thereafter in other European countries (Jung & Saif, 2015; Song & Park, 2012). This disease, characterized by a severe, profuse watery diarrhoea with or without vomiting and dehydration, is caused by a positive sense, single\u2010stranded RNA enveloped coronavirus of 28 kb called the porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) (Jung & Saif, 2015). PEDV reference strain, CV777, was isolated in Belgium in 1977 (Pensaert & de Bouk, 1978). After several outbreaks in the 70s, PED has been persisting in Europe with sporadic cases until the late 1990s (Jung & Saif, 2015). Outbreaks of PED were also described in Asia in the 1980s and then between 2010 and 2012 (Jung & Saif, 2015; Wang et al., 2013). A new type of strain, genetically different from the reference strain, was isolated during those recent outbreaks, inducing a strong mortality despite the frequent uses of vaccines based on CV777 strain in Asia (Li et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013). In 2013, swine producers in the United States of America were hit by PED although the country had previously been free from the disease. The PED disease spread rapidly throughout the country and in neighbouring countries of North and South America such as Canada and Mexico. Two genetically distant PEDV strains were isolated in the USA, namely the non\u2010InDel strains, genetically similar to the aforementioned Asian strains, and the InDel strains, showing insertions\u2013deletions in the S1 part of the S gene (Jung & Saif, 2015; Vlasova et al., 2014). From clinical reports, these two strains seemed to behave differently in terms of morbidity and mortality: The non\u2010InDel strains were associated with more severe clinical cases and higher case fatality rate compared with the InDel strains (Vlasova et al., 2014; Wang, Byrum, & Zhang, 2014). In contrast with non\u2010InDel strains, exclusively reported in America and Asia, InDel strains were also identified in Europe since 2014 (EFSA, 2016; Stadler et al., 2015, Vlasova et al., 2014). To date, PEDV circulates in America, Asia and Europe with different patterns in terms of epidemiological behaviour and persistence of the virus in the pig population.",

            "text": "Several studies focusing on the different types of PEDV strains allowed for a better understanding of PEDV epidemiology and pathogenicity. Because of a very low infectious dose (Thomas et al., 2015), PEDV can be transmitted by contact with contaminated equipment, the staff or contaminated vehicles used for animal transport (Bowman, Krogwold, Price, Davis, & Moeller, 2015; Jung & Saif, 2015; Lowe et al., 2014), but oro\u2010faecal transmission is the main transmission route. PEDV is shed in faeces favouring a rapid transmission to susceptible pigs sharing the same environment as infected animals (Jung & Saif, 2015). Airborne transmission was evidenced over relatively long distances for non\u2010InDel strains (Alonso et al., 2014), but still needs to be investigated as a potential transmission route for InDel PEDV strains.",

Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare the pathogenicity and quantify the level of PEDV during transmission through different routes of strains that represent the two types of PEDV isolated in 2014, an American non\u2010InDel strain (PEDV/USA/2014/IOWA) and a French InDel strain (PEDV/FR/001/2014) under experimental conditions in a na\u00efve pig population.",

The PEDV InDel strain, PEDV/FR/001/2014 strain (GB No: KR011756), was amplified on a 3\u2010week\u2010old SPF pig inoculated with homogenate of jejunum collected from PED\u2010affected pigs belonging to a farm located in the north of France in 2014. The inoculum was prepared from the jejunum of the SPF PED\u2010affected pig. For the PEDV non\u2010InDel strain, PEDV/USA/2014/IOWA strain (GB No: MF37363), jejunum samples were collected from pigs from one herd affected by a non\u2010InDel PEDV strain in the state of Iowa (USA) in 2014 and homogenized in phosphate\u2010buffered saline. The two homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000\u00d7 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, and supernatants were passed through a 0.45\u2010\u03bcm filter. Next\u2010generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on each inoculum to obtain the PEDV complete genome sequence and to ensure the absence of other RNA viral sequences. The inocula were also negative for porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). These absences were assessed by the absence of seroconversion against PCV2 and PRRSV after inoculation.",

The experimental design was approved by the ethics committee on animal experiments registered under number #16 by the French Ministry of Research (referral no. 16\u2010032). For each strain, twenty large\u2010white specific pathogen\u2010free (SPF) weaned pigs, 28 days old, were equally distributed into two separate rooms (A and B) containing two separate pens (10 pigs per room) (Figure 1). Three additional SPF weaned piglets were housed in a third room C and used as negative control. In each room A and B, a seeder pig was placed in pen A in direct contact with four other pigs. In pen B, five na\u00efve pigs were placed in indirect contact with pen A. The pens A and B were 40 cm apart and separated by a solid partition between the two pens to prevent any direct transfer of faecal material. The same design was used for the American non\u2010InDel strain. The control animals were sampled first. Strict biosecurity measures were used during this two experiments to avoid any sample contamination. The outside portion of pen A and pen B was washed before every stage of sampling, and a footbath was set up before the entry of each pen. Individuals entering pens washed their boots and wading boots before passing through the footbath. The animals in pen B were also sampled before those of pen A. The manipulator also showered and changed clothes between each room of the two repetitions.",

            "text": "The severity of porcine epidemic diarrhoea can be linked to several parameters such as the animal age, the infectious dose, the susceptibility of pigs, the environmental conditions or the viral strain (Shibata et al., 2000). The objective of this study was to compare the pathogenicity and transmissibility of an American non\u2010InDel strain considered highly pathogenic and an InDel strain isolated in France in 2014 in experimental conditions. In case of infection with a non\u2010InDel and an InDel strain, 100% of morbidity (except for the InDel indirect contact pigs) was observed, but clinical signs were not apparent at the same time among the two types of PEDV\u2010infected groups. As early as 1 dpi, the first clinical signs were observed for the non\u2010InDel strain, although the InDel strain induced the first clinical signs only at 5 dpi. These results are in agreement with previous experimental studies involving the non\u2010InDel strain reporting the occurrence of diarrhoea and occasional vomiting from 2 to 10 days after inoculation (Crawford et al., 2015; Madson et al., 2014; Niederwerder et al., 2016; Shibata et al., 2000) and also with previous studies involving InDel strains reporting the appearance of clinical signs within 1 week after infection (Hanke et al., 2015; Mesquita et al., 2015; Stadler et al., 2015). Intermittent clinical signs were also noticed with the two strains after the occurrence of the first clinical signs; InDel\u2010infected pigs showed clinical signs (occasional diarrhoea, vomiting and despondency) from 8 to 49 dpi, and non\u2010InDel\u2010infected pigs showed clinical signs from 3 to 46 dpi. PEDV replicates in the enterocytes and leads to a significant reduction in both the intestinal epithelial cells, as well as the digestive enzyme activity (Jung, Ahn, & Chae, 2006). However, the regeneration of intestinal enterocytes was shown possible between 2 and 4 days after damage (Moon, 1971), which might explain the intermittent clinical signs observed in the InDel and non\u2010InDel trials. The clinical signs were more pronounced for the non\u2010InDel trial pigs in our study. It has already been shown that differences in severity of clinical signs could be linked to the different strains; the InDel strain leads to less severe clinical signs compared with the non\u2010InDel strain (Chen et al., 2016). The development of the disease was responsible for weight loss, which depended on the strain used. All the non\u2010InDel pigs had more severe weight loss during the first week after inoculation compared to the InDel pigs. As in our study, Madson et al. (2014) detected a significant alteration in ADWG during the first week postinoculation for non\u2010InDel\u2010infected pigs (Madson et al., 2014). Regarding the InDel pigs, growth retardation was observed the second and the third week after inoculation. After the first 3 weeks of the trial, no difference in ADWG was observed between controls and infected pigs within the non\u2010InDel group.",

The PEDV RNA was detected earlier in faeces of the non\u2010InDel trial pigs at 1 dpi compared to 2 \u00b1 0.5 dpi in faeces of InDel inoculated pigs, that is, 1 \u00b1 0.5 days earlier for the non\u2010InDel pigs. Similar results were observed from faeces of direct contact pigs where PEDV RNA was detected in faeces of non\u2010InDel direct contact pigs between 1 and 2 dpi and between 4.5 and 14 dpi in faeces of InDel direct contact pigs, that is, on average 7 days earlier for the non\u2010InDel direct contact pigs. These results suggest the non\u2010InDel PEDV strain replicates more quickly in the target cells and/or demonstrates the ability to propagate to higher levels more quickly in a pig population. The shedding periods were similar for the InDel (except for the indirect contact pigs) and non\u2010InDel strains. The shedding periods for the non\u2010InDel and InDel strains were close to previous observations from other studies which reported shedding periods of 17\u201323 or 18\u201320 days on average for the non\u2010InDel (Madson et al., 2014; Thomas et al., 2015) and for the InDel strain, respectively (Leidenberger et al., 2017; Lohse et al., 2017). Two others studies on PEDV InDel strains revealed that pigs inoculated with an InDel strain began to shed virus earlier than in our experimental conditions, that is, shedding began at 1 dpi, and the presence of PEDV RNA in faeces was detected until the pigs were necropsied at 7 dpi (Chen et al., 2016; Yamamoto, Soma, Nakanishi, Yamaguchi, & Niinuma, 2015). In accordance with the results of other studies (Chen et al., 2016), the amount of genomic copies in faeces was more important in infected pigs by the non\u2010InDel strain than for those that were infected by the InDel strain whatever the pig status (inoculated, direct contact, indirect contact) in our experimental conditions.",

The same phenomenon had already been described recently (Crawford et al., 2015). During the second phase of PEDV shedding in faeces, no clinical signs were observed. The presence of PEDV RNA in faeces in spite of the absence of clinical signs could raise problems in terms of occasional transmission of the disease by asymptomatic pigs that remain unknown to the producer.",

Results of our study confirmed the detection of non\u2010InDel and InDel PEDV RNA in air samples. The duration of detection of PEDV RNA in the air was similar for the InDel and for the non\u2010InDel strains (30 vs 34 days on average). Although the viral genome was detected in the air, airborne transmission to pigs in indirect contact was only effective for the non\u2010InDel strain under our experimental conditions. The amount of PEDV genomic copies in air was higher for the non\u2010InDel than for the InDel strain. Thus, we could hypothesize that the amount of PEDV genomic copies in air with the InDel strain was too low to infect pigs by airborne transmission (104 genome copies/L). The infectious capacity of PEDV by the air could also be linked to the strain. In fact, in a recent study using a different non\u2010InDel strain from ours, airborne transmission to pigs in indirect contact was not effective even when PEDV RNA was detected in nasal swabs of infected pigs but at low levels (Niederwerder et al., 2016).",

Indeed, the direct transmission rate quantified in our experimental conditions was more than twofold higher for the non\u2010InDel strain than for the InDel strain. An indirect transmission rate could only be calculated for the non\u2010InDel strain (\u03b2w = 0.5). A lower duration of latency for the non\u2010InDel strain was also observed which is in agreement with the faster replication observed from the virological data. From our experimental results, a faster transmission in case of non\u2010InDel strain should be expected in a pig population. This faster transmission could be linked to higher virulence and faster replication of the PEDV non\u2010InDel strain in the epithelial cells. The comparison of the transmission parameters calculated for the two PEDV strains with those estimated for other porcine viruses revealed a transmission rate sevenfold higher than those obtained for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (\u03b2w PRRS = 0.24) (Rose et al., 2015) or the porcine circovirus type 2b (\u03b2w\nPCV2b = 0.28) (Andraud et al., 2009; Rose et al., 2015). However, these parameters were comparable to those obtained recently for swine influenza viruses (Cador, Andraud, Willem, & Rose, 2017). Considering the high transmission rate for both strains and the duration of shedding of approximately 20 days, those viruses are expected to persist easily within the population. Differences in terms of indirect transmission suggest that InDel strains of PEDV could be more easily controlled by strict segregation of infected animals.",

The absence of seroconversion for some pigs could be linked to the sensitivity of the ID Vet ELISA test which could be too low (Tignon et al., 2017). The ELISA test used in our study is based on the PEDV N protein as an antigen, and the PEDV N antibodies might not persist as long as the antibodies directed against the PEDV S protein.",
