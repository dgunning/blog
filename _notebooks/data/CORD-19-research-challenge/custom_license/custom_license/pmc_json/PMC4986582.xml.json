The school includes students of Aboriginal and non\u2010Aboriginal backgrounds drawn from the local town and surrounding First Nations reserves. Because A(H1N1)pdm09 had recently emerged in mid\u2010April as a novel virus and in order to characterize its transmission, clinical profile, risk factors, and impact, an outbreak investigation was organized by public health authorities through household telephone survey between May 15 and June 5, 2009.",

For these analyses, we considered two scenarios where both index and secondary case had ILI (no. of pairs = 15) and where index case was laboratory\u2010confirmed and the secondary case had ILI (no. of pairs = 6). We assumed that transmission was possible only if the delay between symptom onset of the index case (infector) and of the secondary case (infectee) in the household was \u22651 day. Thus, according to this assumption, it is not possible for both the index and secondary case to start symptoms on the same day. We fit Weibull, gamma, log\u2010normal, and log\u2010logistic parametric models to the number of days, and the Weibull model achieved the lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC) of these distributions. From the Weibull distribution, we computed median serial interval and its 95% confidence interval (CI).",

We capitalized on a discrete, intense but community\u2010wide outbreak involving households associated with a first affected school and on\u2010reserve Aboriginal people to estimate epidemiologic characteristics uniquely across age groups and among on\u2010 and off\u2010reserve participants. Overall, we identified illness that was mostly mild and self\u2010limited with no hospitalizations or antiviral prescriptions. Young children, those with chronic diseases, and those who previously received the 2008\u20132009 seasonal influenza vaccine were more likely overall to report A(H1N1)pdm09\u2010related illness. Participants on\u2010reserve were more likely to report comorbidity and greater household crowding; they also reported higher ILI, MAILI, and SARs. Overall, the median interval between symptom onset and care seeking was about 5 days, and median time to recovery was 9 days, both also longer among on\u2010reserve participants. A similarly low proportion (20%) of on\u2010/off\u2010reserve participants sought care within 48 hours; access to health care services in the region is generally considered comparable both on\u2010/off\u2010reserve.

In our study, the overall SAR was 22%, higher in those age <1 year (38%) and 1\u20134 years (50%). There is a wide variation in report of SAR from various settings, which is not unexpected. Our estimates are similar to household transmission studies in Germany (26%),\n12\n Kenya (26%),\n20\n and the United States (18%).\n8\n These estimates were slightly lower than other studies in Canada (Sikora C et al: 30%; Papenburg J et al: any ILI: 29%, laboratory\u2010confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 ILI: 26%, and laboratory\u2010confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 including asymptomatic infections: 45%)\n15\n, \n21\n and the United States (27\u00b73%).\n22\n Conversely, our estimates are higher than others reported from Japan (7\u00b76%),\n23\n UK (17%),\n24\n and United States (4\u201313%; 11%; 14\u00b73%).\n9\n, \n16\n, \n25\n Many factors affect transmission and hence SAR within households including age, antiviral use, and ascertainment of index and secondary cases or contacts, as well as socio\u2010environmental factors such as climate, crowding, and control behaviors such as the use of masks and hand washing. The initiation of treatment for the index case upon illness onset or the following day was associated with a 42% reduction in secondary infections in households in a Japanese study.\n26\n In the study by Morgan et al.\n\n16\n (SAR: 4\u201313%), most of the index cases (72%) had received treatment. In the New York school household transmission study (SAR: 11%), about one quarter (26%) of index cases took antiviral treatment and 71% started within 2 days of illness onset.\n9\n About 7% of the household contacts also received antiviral prophylaxis. In the Suess et al.\n\n12\n study, SAR among those who did not receive prophylaxis was 26%, very close to our own measured rate. Reduced virus shedding with antiviral treatment for seasonal and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses has been reported.\n13\n, \n27\n, \n28\n Thus, differences in SAR may also in part be attributed to variation in antiviral use. The pattern we found of higher SAR among children than adults (highest in 0\u20134 and lowest in \u226550 years) is also consistent with other studies.\n9\n, \n15\n, \n16\n A higher SAR among children may be explained by differences in cross\u2010protective innate or acquired immunity as well as contact and hygiene patterns.\n22\n, \n29\n\n",

The study relied upon a non\u2010specific clinical outcome (ILI) for defining A(H1N1)pdm09\u2010related illness. There are many causes of ILI as evidenced by other contributing viruses identified through passive surveillance during the study period (see prior publication).\n1\n Other respiratory viruses detected from the local community during that period included coronavirus and rhinovirus/enterovirus. We thus attempted to validate the ILI case definition based on A(H1N1)pdm09 sero\u2010positive status and used that to define the study population, but participation in the sero\u2010survey was self\u2010selected and sample size was small. Secondly, we relied on report by one adult for all household members. ILI experience, duration of illness, and TIV history may have been less well known for other household members. Thirdly, sample size was small with large confidence intervals especially for stratified analyses. In comparing school A and on\u2010reserve households, we identified some overlap including 36 of 191 on\u2010reserve participants who also attended school A. To address this, we separately presented estimates for school A participants with and without on\u2010reserve residency but this further reduced sample size, introducing variability.",
