Today, the population of this city has grown to more than 7 million [2].

The territory of Hong Kong was initially restricted to Hong Kong Island, with the British then extending their boundaries in two phases. The first phase, in 1860, saw the British outpost being extended to the Kowloon Peninsula, and in 1898 it was again extended to include the New Territories. Hong Kong underwent its first peaceful and democratic transfer of power in 1997 when China regained sovereignty [4, 5]. The area had been occupied by the Japanese in 1941 after the Battle of Hong Kong, which occupancy ended after 3 years and 8 months [6] when Japan surrendered at the end of the Second World War, in 1945.",

The age structure of a population is directly related to that society\u2019s productivity and economy [10]. Hong Kong has an advantage in that the percentage of its population that is of working age is one of the highest in the world. Hong Kong\u2019s working-age population (15\u201364 years) is about 74.8 %, and the median age in the territory is 43.4 years. The older age group (65 years and over) comprises about 13.5 % of Hong Kong\u2019s population (Fig. 1). It has been observed that a higher proportion of older people leads to a critical shortage in manpower and tends to undermine productivity. The healthcare costs of an older population are noted to be economically unproductive, which is also a burden for society [10].",

In 1998, two more bioinformatics papers by different research groups were published in the journal Bioinformatics. Smith and Xue, from the Biochemistry Department of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), developed a method for summing up and presenting the information contained in a set of aligned sequences to identify patterns within the sequences and represent them in a more accurate and graphical form [13]. Chau et al.

Currently, several undergraduate or postgraduate programmes or courses are available in the specific area of bioinformatics (Table 1). The departments of Biochemistry and Computer Science at HKU offered the first undergraduate programme, a B.Sc. in Bioinformatics, in September 2001; this combined programme of biochemistry and computer science was supported by both departments. This course is not currently being offered by HKU. Instead, HKU\u2019s Department of Biochemistry offers \u2018Sequence Bioinformatics\u2019 (course code: BIOC3608), a course for B.Sc. students that carries 6 credit points. This course was planned to enable students to gain a full knowledge of sequence bioinformatics. Outcomes of the course include knowledge of algorithms for sequence alignments, BLAST searches and construction of phylogenetic trees. A course with the same name but a different course code (BIOC3605) is offered by the Faculty of Medicine at HKU for a Bachelor Degree in Medical Science. Although this course also carries 6 credit points, the course syllabus is different; students learn about computational methods for analysis of DNA and protein sequences. In addition, the Computer Science Department in the Faculty of Engineering at HKU offers a course entitled \u2018Computational Molecular Biology\u2019 (course code CSIS0326), also carrying 6 credit points, for students pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering degree. The course teaches the students how to use algorithms to work out computational problems related to the enormous amount of information produced by modern molecular biology techniques.\n\n",

Research laboratories in the Department of Biochemistry of the CUHK, the Department of Biochemistry and the Applied Genomics Center of the HKUST and the Genome Research Centre of the HKU were involved in the development of the second-generation human haplotype map in which researchers identified more than 3.1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [17]. Meanwhile, the Applied Genomics Center and Fok Ying Tung Graduate School of the HKUST, the Department of Biochemistry at the HKUST and the Institute of Digestive Disease at the CUHK participated in cancer genome projects as published in Nature [18]. Human brachydactyly type A1 (BDA1) was the first disorder recorded with autosomal-dominant type abnormalities. A study by Hong Kong researchers revealed that the BDA1 mutation (E95K) impairs the interaction of Indian hedgehog (IHH) receptor PTCH1 with the antagonist HIP1 [19].

Computational biology researchers are currently investigating the H5N1 virus, strains of which cause H5N1 avian influenza may be transferrable to humans [32]. This virus is highly pathogenic and has caused a pandemic \u2018bird flu\u2019 incident in the Hong Kong SAR. Several researchers have reported the emergence of multiple genotypes of the H5N1 virus in terrestrial poultry, leading to an outbreak of avian influenza in chickens in retail markets in Hong Kong and the molecular changes in the virus associated with this event [33]. One study published in Nature investigated the long-term evolution and dynamics of transmission of swine influenza A virus (SwIV) using a data set of more than 650 SwIV isolates and more than 800 swine sera from 12 years of systematic monitoring in Hong Kong, including the H1N1/2009 virus that caused a human pandemic [34]. Another study characterised a reassortant progeny of H1N1/2009 with swine viruses [35]. A study published in Nature on the origins and evolutionary genomics of swine-origin H1N1 influenza carried out phylogenetic analysis of the gaps in genetic surveillance and applied evolutionary analysis to estimate the timescale of the origins, finding that a remixture of swine influenza lineages may have occurred years before appearing in humans [36].",

Another study aimed to understand the dissimilarity of two new Dehalococcoides mccartyi strains through collaboration between US and Hong Kong scientists. In this study, Lee et al. [38] performed a comparative genomics analysis via a microarray and concluded that the observed functional incongruence between the activity and core genome phylogenies of D. mccartyi strains is probably caused by a horizontal shift in significant reductive dehalogenase-encoding genes.

Professor Tsui\u2019s group worked on genomic-sequence variations and the epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [42]. Dr. Jun Wang from the Department of Biochemistry at the HKU is working on computational and transcriptional genomics, structural bioinformatics, SNPs and copy number variation (CNV). He developed an SNP detection algorithm for next-generation sequencing data [43] and also worked on a genome-wide association study on alleles in the FGFR2 gene that is associated with risk of breast cancer [44]. Ascertaining the dynamic nature of gene regulation is a significant challenge in systems biology, an area of research interest in Hong Kong. The corresponding author of this review is working on reconstructing dynamic gene regulatory networks for human cancer, to unravel the dynamic mechanism of cancer development [45]. Dr. Yip Yuk Lap Kevin from the School of Life Sciences at CUHK is researching the use of computational methods to study biological and medical phenomena and networks, and has published work in the journals Nature and Bioinformatics [46, 47]. Other eminent Hong Kong researchers have been working in the field of computational biology for decades; an attempt to outline the activities of these researchers, to provide a bird\u2019s-eye view of their research activities, is given in Table 5. We have also attempted to determine the proportion of total research in Hong Kong that is related to computational biology, finding that publications in the area of bioinformatics comprise about 9 % of total publications (Fig. 5).\n\n",

A major focus of the Hong Kong SAR government, therefore, is assisting companies to fulfil the need for medical products. Recent trends in Hong Kong\u2019s population have shown a shift of disease types towards malignant neoplasms, heart disease, pneumonia, cerebrovascular disease, etc. There is a resulting increase in the demand for high-tech products and services that use biotechnology and bioinformatics tools. In response to the outbreak of SARS, many biotechnological companies were established to develop diagnostic kits. One such project involves the development of a biochip by Dr. Yu Cheung-Hoi Albert of the HKUST, which was highlighted in Science magazine [48]. This \u2018lab-on-a-chip\u2019 rapidly diagnoses emerging pathogens, including influenza viruses; Yu subsequently established the company Hai Kang Life to manufacture these DNA chips. Cluster Technology Limited (ClusterTech) is a computing technology company in Hong Kong which provides solutions for bioinformatics research that combine high-performance computing and cloud computing technology; several other companies have also been established in this area. To assist with world-class infrastructure for such companies, the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTPC) was established by the Hong Kong SAR government in May 2001 to provide core competency in manufacturing technology, biotechnology, information technology (including computational biology), environmental technology, management systems, etc. The HKSTPC manages three industrial estates and mentors technology-based companies through its incubation programme which assists with business development for potential new entrepreneurs.",

However, compared with other developed countries around the world, Hong Kong still has some way to go in this field. Research in the life sciences with the aid of computational biology is occurring on a large scale in Hong Kong and is still gaining impetus. Collaborative research activities between bioinformaticians and laboratory biologists at both a national and an international level are also increasing rapidly. Such collaborative research groups analyse biological data ranging from genes to proteins, attempt to solve important biological questions together with laboratory scientists, make various predictions and validate different hypotheses. Despite this positive outlook, however, several challenges exist. More national centres for bioinformation, similar to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) in the USA, are needed to provide a central depository and information source for biological data and tools.",

Research must be sustained as a key area of investment to improve efficiency and competitiveness in meeting Hong Kong\u2019s needs, such as in the medical sector. To identify and support the existing researchers in the field of computational biology, more professional societies and journals indexed in the Science Citation Index should be initiated to drive Hong Kong computational biology towards new heights.
