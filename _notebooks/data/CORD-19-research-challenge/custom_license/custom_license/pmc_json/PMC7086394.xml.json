The position of the cross-linker and the macrocycle size were\ndeemed the most influential characteristics in the previously mentioned\ncross-linking strategies; therefore, we wanted to evaluate both of\nthese criteria independently for our system. The most favorable candidates\ncould then be used to test the effect of structural changes on coiled-coil-based\nmembrane fusion. One stapling strategy that attracted our attention\nwas developed by the DeGrado lab, and it is based on the alkylation\nof cysteine using dibromoxylenes.31 The\nadvantage of this system lies in the rigidity provided by the aromatic\nring, allowing precise spacing between the two thiol moieties by selecting\none of the three different structural isomers of dibromoxylene: ortho, meta, and para; Scheme 1. In the original\nstudy, meta-xylene showed the most promise as a cross-linker,\nand further investigations in the same group have therefore focused\non this variant.32,33 Other recent investigations have\nalso predominantly used the meta derivative,34,35 and when a comparison was made between the isomers, only short or\nunstructured peptides were used. This means the question of whether,\nfor a helical or coiled-coil peptide, meta-xylene\nis indeed the best cross-linking moiety is unanswered. Therefore,\nto probe the effect of stapling on coiled-coil peptides, we elected\nto investigate dibromoxylene cross-linking of cysteines, employing\nall three structural isomers in order to elucidate the role of cross-linker\nsize and its effect on structure and activity.",

Notably, when para-xylene was used as the\ncross-linker in the second heptad, the overall peptide helicity was\nreduced, Figure 1B,\nshowing para-xylene is too large to form an ideal\n\u03b1-helix. The N-terminal positions (K3GW-1 variants)\nall show a moderate increase in helicity, largely independent of staple\nsize, confirming the previously observed trend for hydrocarbon stapling\nto be most effective at peptide termini.37 Using temperature-dependent CD spectroscopy, an increase in melting\ntemperature (Tm) could be determined for\nthe stapled peptide variants, as shown in Figures 2 and S2, with\nthe change in Tm closely following the\nobserved changes in helicity. C-terminal modification showed the largest\nincrease in melting temperature, with the ortho-xylene\ncross-linker yielding the most stable peptides over all three peptide\nvariants, followed by the meta-xylene cross-linker.\nAll stapled peptides interacted with E3GY, showing typical\ncoiled-coil spectra as is evident in Figures 1C and S1. C-terminal\nstapling showed the highest helicity, while the N-terminal stapled\npeptides did not have increased coiled-coil helicity compared to the\nstaples located in the central heptad. In contrast to the stapled\npeptides in isolation, meta-xylene-modified peptides\nshow the most \u03b1-helical structure as a coiled coil. ortho-Xylene stapled peptides had the largest increase in Tm for all three positions (Figure 2), and the trends in coiled-coil\nstability are similar to those observed for the single peptides, with\nan average increase in Tm of 4.9 \u00b0C\nfor the stapled peptides (Table S1) and\n4.8 \u00b0C for their coiled coils (Table S2). meta-Xylene was previously shown to have the\nlargest increase in helicity in small unstructured peptides,31 but in the E/K system ortho-xylene stapled variants yielded the highest single-peptide helicity\nand largest increase in Tm for both the\npeptides and their respective coiled-coils. Because it is possible\nthat stapling affects coiled-coil interactions without changing peptide\nhelicity as observed via the thermal unfolding experiments, the effect\nof peptide stapling on coiled-coil binding was further investigated\nusing isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).",

The effect of enthalpy can be\nexplained via the formation of amide hydrogen bonds and electrostatic\ninteractions upon folding of the peptide. When the C-terminally stapled\nvariants of peptide K3GW are analyzed, the Kd is decreased from 73 to 22 and 24 nM for the 3O and 3M variants, respectively, and to\n51 nM for the 3P variant. A large decrease in \u0394Sb was observed and was directly related to the\nsize of the implemented staple. ortho-Xylene stapling\nat the C-terminus reduced the effect of entropy upon binding from\n37 to 24 kJ/mol, a reduction of 35%. At the same time, an increase\nin the \u0394Hb from \u221277 to \u221268\nkJ/mol was observed, counteracting the observed entropic effects and\nleading to the conclusion that the mechanism of peptide stapling relies\non a preorganization effect: through conformational restriction, the\npeptide is preorganized in a helical conformation which reduces the\nentropic effects of binding, but some of the energy that is gained\nupon formation of an \u03b1-helix is also lost. Although the Kd for the C-terminal ortho-\nand meta-xylene stapled peptides is comparable, the\n\u0394Sb is more favorable for the ortho variant, explaining the large differences in Tm observed for these two peptides. At all three\nstapling positions, the ortho variants show a reduced\neffect of entropy upon binding compared to the meta variants, which is likely caused by the smaller size of the ortho cross-linker. A smaller cross-linker restricts the\nmaximum distance between the two helical turns and therefore limits\nthe number of possible conformations that the peptide can assume.",

            "text": "For SNARE-mediated membrane\nfusion, it is known that multiple protein\ncomplexes are required to drive fusion of a single vesicle, and the\nlikelihood of fusion occurring is dependent on the number of protein\ncomplexes at the fusion interface.45,46 This cooperativity\nis likely also necessary for our coiled-coil based system, and any\ninteractions that influence the amount of coiled-coils that can be\ncoassembled around a fusion interface will influence the amount of\nfusion observed. In this case, both K3GW-3O and K3GW-3M show increased binding and lowered binding entropy and\ntherefore increased fusion via a lower dissociation rate. For K3GW-3M, this difference is less significant\nand is likely to be partially counteracted by the increased membrane\naffinity of the peptide. This is a competitive interaction in the\nformation of the coiled-coil complex, and an interaction which can\nprovide a pathway for dissipation of the free peptide after dissociation\nof the coiled coil.41 In this manner, the\ntotal number of peptide complexes that are formed around a membrane\nfusion interface is reduced, and no increase in membrane fusion is\nobserved. This reasoning can also be applied to homomeric peptide\ninteractions, which could provide a pathway for dissipation of the\nlipopeptide away from the fusion interface. CD titration was performed\nwith K3GW and the K3GW-3O and\nK3GW-3M analogues to test for homodimerization\n(Figure S9 and Table S5), but the dimerization constant was found to be comparable\nfor all variants and weak enough that this should not be considered\nan important part of the fusion mechanism. This mechanistic understanding\nderived from the observed differences between the two stapled peptide\nvariants will require further confirmation in different systems and\nexperiments.",

CD and ITC experiments showed that both stapling\nlocation and choice of staple affected the properties of the resulting\npeptides and coiled-coil complexes, with the largest increase in structure,\nbinding, and stability observed for peptides stapled close to the\nC-terminus with ortho-xylene.

This effect was true for all three\nstapling sites and is due to the smaller size of the ortho-xylene cross-linker.
