SFTSV is infected mainly by tick stings, and it also can be infected by contacting with the blood and secretion of SFTS patients [1, 2]. SFTSV is a novel phlebovirus within bunyavirus family [3], which can damage cells and tissue widely [4]. SFTS is an acute illness with clinical presentations of abrupt fever, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, gastrointestinal symptoms, neural disorders, proteinuria, hematuria and bleeding tendency [5\u20138]. The case fatality rate for this severe disease was 30 % [3]. However, the pathogenic mechanism in patients with SFTSV infection is still unclear.",

Some authors had found that SFTS patients were at least partly immune-mediated, which might play an important role in determining the severity and clinical outcome [10]. Lymphocyte played an important role in the induction of cellular immunity in organism. Dysfunction of lymphocyte subsets caused immunofunction abnormality, which made disease deteriorate progressively and protractedly. Lymphocytes could stimulate the organism to produce immune response against viral antigens when organism was infected with SFTSV. It is clear that many viruses encode specific gene products that antagonize the immune response in recent years [11, 12]. Therefore, figuring out how SFTSV interacts with the host immune system is essential to understand the molecular mechanisms of SFTS. Until recently, immunofunction and lymphocyte subpopulation studies with respects to SFTSV infection are insufficient. We analyzed T-cell subgroups and their possible roles in SFTS disease.",

The viral RNA of all SFTS samples was detected to confirm positively for SFTSV infection by using a certificated real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kit [13]. Serum samples from 20 healthy volunteers (who neither suffer from any disease nor take medicine in recent weeks) were normal control, and we divided SFTS patients into different groups based on consistent clinical features. The serum samples of the acute phase of the patients were collected in an initial week, and after 2 weeks, they were in recovery phase. For mild and severe cases, the serum samples were collected around 7\u201312 days post the onset of illness according to the patients\u2019 condition.

However, some SFTS patients died of heart and respiratory failure during the initial several hours of hospitalization, so we did not get the samples. Among these patients, there were 12 patients (35.29 %) in acute phase, including 9 females and 3 males, with an average age of 57 years; 14 patients were severe, including 11 females and 3 males, with an average age of 58 years (Table 1).

It had been shown that innate immune responses determined the pathogenesis of SFTS, as well as high level of viral replication [10]. The amount of lymphocyte and its subsets was stable relatively in peripheral blood and tissue. And lymphocyte produced moderate immune response, which could eliminate foreign antigen without injuring intracorporal organism. But the balance was broken when SFTSV invaded and the amount of lymphocytic subpopulations changed. Our study showed that the expression level of lymphocyte subsets was abnormal in the peripheral blood of SFTS, especially in acute phase and severe SFTS patients.",

The total number of T cells in SFTS patients decreased significantly and the decline in the number of CD3+ T lymphocytes prompted that the number of active cells was insufficient to participate in cellular immune response, and then, the cellular immune function was low in SFTS patients. The expression of CD4+ on T cells was obviously reduced in SFTS, which made the function of immune globulin downgrade. At the same time, we also found that the percentage of NK cells was significantly high. It was well known that NK cells were classified as lymphocytes on the basis of their morphology, expression of lymphoid markers and common origin. NK cells had been shown in humans and mice to participate in the early control against virus infection [15]. NK cells could kill virally infected or transformed cells [16]. Therefore, NK cells were highly important for the pathogenesis of SFTS disease progression.",

            "text": "It was revealed in our study that the variation of lymphocyte subpopulation was associated with the phase of the disease and the patient\u2019s condition. In acute phase, the leukocyte count was less than 4 \u00d7 109/L, and it gradually returned to normal level in convalescence phase, while the leukocyte count was 2-4 \u00d7 109/L in mild SFTS patients, and it was less than 2 \u00d7 109/L in severe SFTSV infection. The percentages of CD3+ and CD4+ were significantly lower in the acute phase and severe SFTSV infection than those in recovery phase and mild SFTSV infection. The balance of immunocytes was broken and lymphocytopenia took place due to the effects of multiple stimuli. Li et al. [17] found that CD4+ T lymphocytes had a sharp decline in the research of severe acute respiratory syndromes (ARDS), which resulted in the damage of cellular immune function. CD4+ T lymphocytes could induce the virus specificity cytotoxic T cell forming specific polyclone immunity and assist B cell to produce neutralizing antibody, which made key roles in incubation period and acute phase when virus infected. We presumed that the reasons for the reduction of CD3+ and CD4+ T cells in acute and severe SFTS were as follows: firstly, T lymphocytes which struggled with SFTSV avoided fierce injuries to the organism; secondly, complicated immune made T lymphocytes damage and weakened the ability of immune response in the urgent condition of disease [18]. In contrast to T cells, we found that the count of NK cells was showed to increase, and the differences were statistically significant in acute and severe cases. NK cells, as components of innate immune defense, could directly induce the death of virus-infected cells in the absence of specific immunization, such as cellular immune. NK cells possessed immunoregulatory functions since they secreted cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-10 and G-CSF. These inflammatory cytokines and chemokines played roles in the pathogenesis of virus infection, and the levels of them were related to the severity of the illness [19, 20]. Simultaneously, NK cells might exacerbate the disease by releasing multiple inflammatory cytokines and chemokines or damaging the affected tissues through direct cytotoxicity [21]. It had been found that the level of IFN-\u03b3 increased in fatal SFTS cases[20], and IFN-\u03b3 could induce apoptosis of lymphocytes[22]. This might be one of the possible mechanisms of lymphocytopenia in SFTS patients due to direct and indirect attack of SFTSV. Therefore, we inferred that NK cells educed main roles against SFTSV infection when cellular immune function was weakened obviously. However, the indicators would rise again obviously during the recovery phase, which prompted that it was temporary for the cell immunosuppression resulting from SFTSV infection.",

Moreover, as the SFTS disease developed, the level of T leukocyte count was progressively diminished, and there was a more significant decline in the expression of CD3+ and CD4+ T cells. Th1 was the positive cell in CD4+ T lymphocytes, and SFTSV triggered the immune system mechanisms mainly by stimulating the Th1 cells to produce immune responses against the viruses [21]. Deng et al .[21] had demonstrated that SFTSV activated mainly Th1 immune response against viral invasion. The decline of CD4+ T lymphocytes caused the suppression of immunofunction, which might aggravate the patient\u2019s condition. At the same time, we found that the percentage of B cells in death cases was significantly higher than that in the survival cases. It might indicate that humoral immunity could be activated when patient\u2019s condition was extremely serious, and then, humoral immunity produced antibody to develop the neutralization and enhance the phagocytosis. The immunofunction was extremely low in severe SFTS that increased the risk of secondary infection. However, the difference in the lymphocyte subgroups might not be helpful to judge the prognosis of death and survival owing to higher variations and lower case numbers.",
