The development of this industry has increased the density (concentration) of poultry farms in some parts of the country. Poultry farming ranging from extensive free range to intensive integrated production systems has provided conditions for the incidence of complex multifactorial infections such as bacterial, mycoplasma, and viral ones. In many cases, respiratory problems are due to infection with several infectious factors rather than with single one (Swayne et al. 2013). Avian influenza (AI), Newcastle disease (ND), and infectious bronchitis (IB) are the major viral infections in broilers that present with respiratory signs.",

These infections occur either in the solitary form or in combination with multifactorial infections. Evidence indicates that most of these factors are synergistic and potentate themselves in infected flocks. In recent years, despite national and domestic prevention and control measures against AI, ND, and IB, coupled with widespread usage of diverse vaccines, outbreaks of these viral diseases still cause respiratory syndromes in broiler flocks resulting in high mortalities annually. Based on available statistics from the Iran Veterinary Organization (IVO), maximum economic damage in broiler flocks is related to losses arising from respiratory complications (Ebadzadeh et al. 2015).",

Newcastle disease caused by avian paramyxovirus I (APMV-I) is also endemic in Asian and the Middle East countries. Co-infections in broiler flocks with AIV and NDV result in great economic losses due to severe morbidity and mortality rates. A third co-infection with IBV worsens the scenario.

Based on Iran Vet GIS, on an annual average, nearly 19,000 farms of the total 25,000 broiler farms are active with about four breeding periods in a year. The aggregation of broiler farms in the various provinces of Iran shows that the highest number is located in Mazandaran and Esfahan provinces. In addition, the number of breeding periods in these farms during each year is distinct on disparate zones (different areas of the country), so that it varies from three times in most central provinces with warm and dry climate up to five times in the northern provinces with moderate and wet climate, on average per year. The study population included all active (in production) broiler farms (based on Iran Vet GIS) that were infected with respiratory diseases as a new case during the study period. A farm infected with respiratory disease was defined as a flock with core clinical signs such as depression, snickering, sneezing, coughing, dyspnea, rattling, and nasal discharges with or without diarrhea or central nervous system signs (wing paralysis, legs paralysis, or twisted neck) that entailed rising mortality rates for at least 3 days.",

Of these, infectious bronchitis, Newcastle disease, and H9N2 influenza have been the major endemic diseases in Iran with numerous studies carried out in this regard (Hadipour and Golchin 2011; Hosseini et al. 2015; Hosseini et al. 2014; Pourbakhsh et al. 2008; Seifi et al. 2010). Furthermore, these diseases were found to be some of the most critical factors for infections in the poultry industry, particularly in broilers, in other countries too (Hassan et al. 2016; Naeem et al. 2007; Xia et al. 2017).",

However, the main challenge in control of IB is the circulation of variable genotypes of virus in different locations and in diverse time intervals. In addition, there is no vaccination available for establishing cross immunity among disparate exploited genotypes. Recently, a different vaccine of IB, containing H120 and 4/91, has been frequently used, but, notwithstanding this issue, again infectious bronchitis is being counted as a critical complication of broiler farms. Through complete fact-findings over the past years, it seems like the circulating serotypes were in morphism, with serotypes 793/B and variant 2 showing the most capacity and frequency on incidence of the disease (Ghalyanchi-Langeroudi et al. 2015). The continuous observations of circulating viruses and using vaccines similar to these circulating strains, along with observation of health principles and biosecurity issues, are strategies that can be implemented for reduction of disease morbidity to infectious bronchitis.",

Furthermore, the roles of H9N2 influenza and velogenic Newcastle viruses in the outbreak of respiratory syndromes are distinct, while their simultaneous infection is the cause of virulence in the farms. On the other hand, due to arguments of distinct strains, combined with alternation of dominant viruses, the serotypes, genotypes, and circulation of strains between viruses are also exposed to unremitting anamorphic conditions. Thus, necessary measures for strategic control of this process include permanent monitoring of respiratory syndrome cases that have occurred as well as the review of vaccination plans for affected flocks in each year. It is recommended that epidemiologic studies should be conducted frequently on risk factors of prevalence of these diseases and effectiveness of vaccination strategy in the flocks.",
