It is generally known that taste is extremely important for the efficacy of preparations. Severe bitter taste, caused by andrographolide,[10] imposes restrictions on the oral compliance, and widespread application of GKSQDT. With the rising number of elderly people and health burden caused by AURTIs in children, the administration of drugs to pediatric and elderly patients is becoming more important and should be more considered.[11] Hence, to ensure patient compliance and promote the application of GKSQDT, the problem of bitter taste needs to be settled.",

            "text": "The reason of bitter taste could be perceived by human is as follows. First, drug and bitter taste receptors on taste cells are combined to produce stimulations in oral cavity. Moreover, the stimulations shoot the gustation center in cerebral central region and are integrated by nerve center.[121314] Based on the formation mechanism of bitter taste, there are three kinds of commonly used masking approaches. One way is through adding sweet taste substances, flavors, or effervescent agents to interfere with the perception of bitter drugs. Commonly used accessories include sucralose, aspartame, orange, mint, tartaric acid, and sodium bicarbonate. Another way is slowing down or stopping drug release in oral cavity, including polymer coating, hot-melt extrusion, complexation (adding cyclodextrins or ion exchange resins), modification of solubility of drug (adding magnesium aluminum silicate), and spray-drying.[151617181920] The third way is preventing the combination of G-protein coupled receptors and bitters through bitterness blocking agent, such as adenosine monophosphate, lipoproteins, and phospholipids.[2122] The common point of these methods needs to add other substances on the basis of original prescription.[2324] However, the proportion of baicalin and andrographolide in GKSQDT is as high as 62.5%. Thus, the amount of accessories is limited. Moreover, oral dispersible tablets are intended to dissolve and/or disintegrate rapidly in the mouth.[25] It is thus difficult to mask bitter taste using above methods for GKSQDT.",

Moreover, to measure the masking effect of particle coating technology for GKSQDT, electronic tongue test, animal preference experiment, and human sensory test were produced. The method was displayed in Figure 1. It showed that particle coating technology can be used to mask bitter taste of GKSQDT and improve the oral compliance without adding any other substance.",
