They were monitored weekly for IgM and IgG1 antibodies to BRSV as described 14  and they were free of clinical signs of respiratory tract disease at the time of inoculation. None of the calves experienced BRSV infection before inoculation. The calves were inoculated at the age of \u223c3 months. A total of 32 calves were included in this study of which 24 were inoculated with BRSV and 8 were mock-inoculated. The inoculation was divided into four experiments (experiments IV, IX, XI, and XIV) and in each experiment all of the calves were inoculated on the same day. Inoculum were either lung wash fluid from a calf infected experimentally with a field isolate of BRSV (used for experiment IV) or cell culture material of BRSV-infected fetal bovine lung cells (used for experiments IX, XI, and XIV) as described. 15,16  Lung wash fluid from an uninfected calf served as mock inoculum in experiment IV, whereas uninfected cell culture of fetal bovine lung cells was used as mock inoculum for the remainder. 16  The calves were only inoculated once by combined intratracheal and aerosol route. A dose of 104.6 (experiment IV) to 105.2 (experiment IX) tissue culture infectious dose50 (TCID50) diluted to 5 ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was administered throughout 10 minutes through a mask covering nostrils and mouth (Waechtomat inhalator VM 82, Kruse, Denmark, most droplets less than 3 \u03bcm). Subsequently, a dose of 104.6 to 105.2 TCID50 diluted to 20 ml in PBS was injected into the trachea. All calves were housed together until the time of inoculation then the control calves were moved to separate, but similar isolation units. To investigate the influence of other agents, three calves in experiment XI were treated daily with 2.5 mg/kg of enrofloxacin (Baytril, Bayer) from 1 day before inoculation until the calves were killed on postinoculation day (PID) 6.",

A few of the apoptotic cells were desquamated to the bronchial lumen, but most cells were situated in vacuoles demonstrating that the phagocytized material described above consisted of apoptotic cells. It was difficult to characterize the phagocytizing cells because of the large vacuoles and the very sparse cytoplasm. In general, CD68-positive mature macrophages were only rarely detected in the bronchial epithelium during the infection. The number of phagocytizing cells and their morphology suggest that the phagocytizing cells were neighboring epithelial cells, but immunostaining with anti-cytokeratin to demonstrate epithelial origin was difficult because of the intense staining of neighboring epithelial cells. Later, on PID 8, many of the alveolar cells were demonstrated to be apoptotic, several of which were phagocytized by other cells. The identity of these alveolar phagocytizing cells are uncertain.

A higher number of neutrophils was seen on PID 4 and some of these cells observed in the lumen of the bronchi did contain BRSV antigen, whereas BRSV antigen was not demonstrated in the neutrophils that were migrating between bronchial epithelial cells toward the lumen. Later, on PID 6 and especially on PID 8, the lumen of bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli were filled with inflammatory exudate composed predominantly of neutrophils containing an abundant amount of viral antigen (Figure 6A) \u25b6 , but not replicating BRSV (Figure 6B) \u25b6  as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, respectively. In comparison, the number of alveolar macrophages was much smaller and only a few contained BRSV antigen. Therefore, the neutrophil is probably the major phagocytizing cell of virus antigen and particles that have reached the bronchial lumen. However, together with mucus and desquamated epithelial cells the neutrophils are also responsible for the obliteration of bronchi and later (PIDs 6 to 8) also the bronchioles and the alveolar lumina. Later, on PID 15, immunostaining using anti-CD68 demonstrated a high number of alveolar macrophages in the alveoli especially in animal IV-8 (Figure 6C) \u25b6 . These macrophages, seen late in the course of infection, were large and activated and some of them contained phagocytized neutrophils (Figure 6D) \u25b6 .

At the time of extensive viral replication in the bronchial epithelium, the infection then spread downwards to the bronchiolar and alveolar epithelium, maybe as a result of the cilia destruction of the bronchial epithelium.

This plugging by cellular debris has also been described in autopsy studies of infants and young children after fatal HRSV infection. 23,29,30  However, in some cases the main changes in children were described to be mononuclear infiltration. 29  This variance is probably caused by different duration of infection because we also observed an increased infiltration by T cells and macrophages during infection. Similar to our studies, analysis of cells obtained by bronchial lavage of infants with HRSV infection demonstrated excessive numbers of neutrophils in both the upper and lower airway. 31  Our study shows that the neutrophils are important for clearance of BRSV excreted into the lumen of the respiratory tract, whereas neutrophils migrating through the bronchial epithelium did not contain BRSV antigen. Further investigations are needed to determine whether the neutrophils might contribute to the observed tissue damage by releasing inflammatory products. However, the blocking of the airways by neutrophils is probably part of the reason for the advanced respiratory distress; and the emphysema seen especially on PID 8 might be caused by trapped air.",

However, our results demonstrate that the severe pathological changes appear when replication of RSV spreads to the alveoli. Moreover, the fact that RSV infection in immunocompromised infants and adults causes severe and even fatal lower respiratory tract disease shows that the amount of virus replication also is important for the pathogenesis as these individuals have prolonged RSV excretion. 25,26,48  This indicates that both a vigorous host immune response and an insufficient restriction of viral replication can contribute to development of severe disease.",

We can conclude that apoptosis is an important way of clearing BRSV-infected bronchial epithelial cells probably followed by phagocytosis by neighboring epithelial cells, whereas neutrophils are important for clearance of virus situated in the lumen of the respiratory tract. Increasing infiltration with CD8+ T cells was seen during infection, but they could not be demonstrated between the bronchial epithelial cells until PIDs 8 to 15 when viral replication no longer could be demonstrated in the bronchial epithelial cells. This suggests that there is no direct contact-dependent CD8+ T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity involved in the clearance of virus in the primary infection. However, this observation only relates to the bronchi. On PID 8 there is a high number of apoptotic cells in the alveoli as well, but because of the anatomical structure and the severe alveolitis it is not possible to determine whether or not the CD8+ cells are in close contact with the apoptotic cells. Further investigations are required to study this issue.",
