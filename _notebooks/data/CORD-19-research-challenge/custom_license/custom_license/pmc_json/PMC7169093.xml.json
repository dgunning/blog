Satisfying outcome requirements is better than attempting to optimize the outcome quality (Section 4.).3.Adaptable choices allow innovation or improvisation as new information and understanding emerges. Adaptable or reversible choices are more robust than \u201clocked\u2010in\u201d choices (provided the decisionmaker avoids indecision). More options are better than fewer, unless we become indecisive. Adaptability is a proxy for robustness against surprise and ignorance (Section 5.).\n",

On the one hand, HIV/AIDS enhances the spread of TB by making individuals more vulnerable to infection. On the other hand, HIV/AIDS is a major cause of death and can thereby reduce the spread of TB. These conflicting tendencies make it challenging (though not impossible) to use quantitative epidemiological models of TB to formulate public health policy in the presence of HIV/AIDS. For instance, if prevention of HIV/AIDS is enhanced, existing TB models do not always provide clear indication of whether intervention against TB can be reduced or must be enhanced, and by how much. Nonetheless, the main features of the disease are understood, and existing TB models can be usefully employed by robustifying them against uncertainties resulting from HIV/AIDS.5\n",

Because the predictions are highly uncertain it might well be that quarantine is more propitious than expected, and that complete closure more pernicious than predicted.

DO includes \u201cparalysis by analysis\u201d and may be driven by accountability requirements, need for self\u2010justification, or perceived magnitude or importance of consequences. Thus, DO usually results in decisions being delayed or revisited many times, whereas DA results in failures to initiate the decision\u2010making process at all.

Second, we explained the tradeoff between the level of uncertainty and the quality of an outcome that can be guaranteed. Finally, combining the first two points, we concluded that alternatives should be prioritized according to their robustness against uncertainty in achieving acceptable outcomes. In short, we advocated robust satisficing rather than optimizing the outcome. Plant refers to an idea somewhat related to the idea of satisficing when she describes her responses to questions from the public as being \u201cas good as I could manage in a changing state of understanding about the outbreak\u201d(Ref. 6, p. 52).",

The use of analogs between new unknown phenomena and previous experience is commonplace, especially for decision making in complex dynamic environments,20 but its robustness to uncertainty is debatable. The high uncertainty of analogical reasoning motivates the strategy of learning and adapting, as the SARS team did very explicitly. The SARS team had to gather more information (including surprises) to resolve the issue of when to \u201cthink outside the box\u201d or to continue reasoning analogically from past experience. Plant also indicates an adaptive approach to resolving uncertainties, saying that questions about why the outbreak occurred and possible health system failures had to await the identification of the virus, inventing a test for it, and determining its modes of transmission.",

Thus, a major proportion of the team's resources and time were devoted to obtaining new information. Implicit is the recognition that treatment decisions and policies had to be malleable as new information came in, and that other options might need to be kept open. The team also was aware that new information might not immediately resolve uncertainties and could even generate new ones: \u201cEven as information accumulates, we may still not know how to interpret that information. Does the [newly obtained] fact that SARS virus can no longer be detected in respiratory secretions mean that the person is no longer infectious?

Anxiety arising from unknowns is a key concern for her because in her view it is chiefly responsible for the variety of dysfunctional or irrelevant ways of coping with the outbreak that she describes (Ref. 6, pp. 49\u201351). A few of the coping styles in her list correspond to our descriptions of DA and DO, both of which are types of indecision. We recognize that anxiety is likely to be a major concern for decisionmakers under extreme uncertainty and pressure. However, our discussion of indecision focused on factors contributing to the difficulty of selecting among alternatives, and a full discussion of ways of dealing with anxiety is beyond our scope. Nevertheless, our recommendations of ways to decrease selection difficulty would decrease anxiety as a byproduct.",

She refers to the importance of trust in establishing effective links with key stakeholders, that is, leaders, spokespeople, and media.

This change reflects our current knowledge in dealing with an outbreak, namely that it is important to recognise the framework within which the affected population operates ...
