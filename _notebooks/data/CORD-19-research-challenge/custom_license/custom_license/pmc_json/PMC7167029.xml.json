These products do not generally contain preservatives or antimicrobial agents and rarely undergo any heat processing prior to consumption. For many years raw fruits and vegetables have been implicated as vehicles for transmission of infectious micro\u2010organisms. Although fresh produce can support the growth and/or survival of many pathogenic bacteria there is little published information on the stability of human pathogenic viruses on these food products. Viruses cannot grow in or on foods but may sometimes be present on fresh produce as a result of faecal contamination. This contamination can arise at source in the growth and harvesting area from contact with polluted water and inadequately or untreated sewage sludge used for irrigation and fertilization. Alternatively, fruits or vegetables handled by an infected person might become contaminated with virus and transmit infection. The most frequently reported foodborne viral infections are viral gastroenteritis and hepatitis A: both have been associated with the consumption of fresh fruit or vegetables.",

Foods become contaminated either directly by infected people or through sewage pollution. Those enteric viruses, which are commonly associated with foodborne outbreaks, either cannot be cultured in the laboratory or can only be cultured with difficulty. Hence information and experimental studies on survival and recovery of viruses from foods often relates to other virus types that are readily cultured. Some of these viruses may be good models for important foodborne viral pathogens, but others may have widely differing characteristics. Enteroviruses, such as Coxsackieviruses and vaccine strains of poliovirus, have been used particularly. They infect via the gastrointestinal tract, occur in the environment as a result of sewage contamination and are relatively stable. However, there are very few published reports of foodborne outbreaks of illness caused by enteroviruses.",

            "text": "This group of viruses infects all age groups. There is a variable incubation period of 12\u201360 h, which is thought to be dose\u2010dependent. It occurs all year round, although in temperate climates most infections occur over the winter months. These viruses are responsible for both sporadic cases of gastroenteritis in the community and for outbreaks in schools, hospitals, old people\u2019s homes, hotels and cruise ships. The national IID study indicated that viruses are the most common cause of IID in the community, with NLV the most frequently reported organism (Wheeler et al. 1999; Food Standards Agency, 2000). From 1992 to 1997, NLVs accounted for one\u2010third of all gastroenteritis outbreaks reported to the PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC) and the number of outbreaks of NLV gastroenteritis exceeded the number of outbreaks of salmonellosis. Unlike the salmonellosis outbreaks, however, only 6% of the NLV outbreaks were known to be food or waterborne (Appleton, 2000). The virus is extremely infectious and secondary cases are a characteristic feature of foodborne outbreaks. Therefore, it is not always possible to determine whether illness is acquired from a foodborne source or by person\u2010to\u2010person transmission (see Table 1). This accounts partly for under\u2010recognition of the extent of foodborne transmission of these viruses. In a review of NLV (SRSV) infection in England and Wales between 1990 and 1995 by the PHLS, direct foodborne transmission could be ascertained in only 14% of outbreaks (Dedman et al. 1998).",

            "text": "The virus was discovered in 1972 by electron microscopy (Kapikian et al. 1972) (Fig. 1). The first virus originated from the town of Norwalk in the United States, and became the prototype of the group. The name small round\u2010structured virus (SRSV), which describes the morphology of the virus particle (Caul and Appleton 1982, Appleton, 2000), was used in the United Kingdom and elsewhere until recently. It has now been agreed informally by virologists working with this group to adopt the name Norwalk\u2010like virus, for the present, so as to bring some conformity to the nomenclature of these viruses. However, formal names have not yet been agreed by the International Committee on Virus Nomenclature. The NLVs form a complex group of viruses. They have formally been classified with the Caliciviridae and are often referred to as human caliciviruses. They are split into two broad genogroups. Most viruses in these two groups have the typical morphology of a 30\u201335 nm diameter particle with an amorphous surface and ragged outline, as originally described for the SRSV group (Caul and Appleton 1982). Within the Caliciviridae there is a second genus of human gastroenteritis viruses, provisionally named Sapporo\u2010like viruses (SLVs). The SLVs have the morphology of classical caliciviruses and are genomically distinct from the NLVs (Green et al. 2000). On sequencing, some strains with classical calicivirus morphology fall into the NLV genus. There are suggestions that the epidemiology of SLVs differs from NLVs, in that SLVs mainly cause infections of young children. It is not clear whether SLVs are of significance in foodborne infections and more studies are needed to clarify their role. Genotypic analysis is being used increasingly to investigate the epidemiology of these two groups of viruses (Fankhauser et al. 1998; Maguire et al. 1999; Hale et al. 2000; Hedlund et al. 2000; Koopmans et al. 2000). There are several serotypes of human caliciviruses, which correspond broadly with the genotypic groups. Most studies have been carried out with NLVs, and indicate that immunity is complex and short\u2010lived (Matsui and Greenberg, 2000). Volunteer studies have shown that people can be infected repeatedly with the same virus strain (Parrino et al. 1977; Johnson et al. 1990).",

It is estimated that they cause one million deaths a year in children under 5 years of age, mostly in developing countries. In developed countries deaths are relatively rare, but rotavirus gastroenteritis is the most frequent reason for admission of young children to hospital. Rotaviruses consistently account for around 80% of all gastroenteritis viruses reported to CDSC, although this figure is probably biased by reports of hospitalized children, rather than the occurrence in the community, where NLVs are of greater significance. Foodborne and particularly waterborne spread are probably a significant route of transmission in developing countries, but in developed countries reports are rare (Table 1).",

Astroviruses have mainly been associated with illness in young children, often under 1 year of age. Reports of astrovirus infection in older children and adults are infrequent, although outbreaks have been reported in the elderly. This may reflect testing policy: detection normally relies on electron microscopy, which is insensitive and often not performed on sporadic samples from adults. The use of more sensitive molecular detection methods is required to assess the incidence and epidemiology of these viruses. Astroviruses have been seen in some adults following the consumption of shellfish or contaminated water, but these incidents appear to be comparatively rare (Kurtz and Lee 1987; Kurtz 1994) (Table 1).",

This technique is fairly insensitive and requires a minimum of 106 virus particles per ml of sample. It has been used widely for detection of virus in faecal samples from patients, but cannot be used for looking for the lower concentration of virus particles present in contaminated food, water and environmental samples. Sequencing of the genome of the Norwalk virus has led to the development of PCR assays, with greatly enhanced sensitivity for virus detection (Ando et al. 2000). However, there is great genomic diversity among the NLVs and one set PCR primers will not detect all strains (Norcott et al. 1994). PCR assays are being used for the examination of food samples, particularly shellfish, but far more complex nucleic acid extraction techniques are required than when working with clinical specimens from patients (Atmar et al. 1993; Green et al. 1998b). There are also greater problems with naturally occurring inhibitors to the PCR reaction in these types of samples. NLVs have been detected in samples of raspberries associated with an outbreak of gastroenteritis in Quebec. Sequence analysis demonstrated that the strain of NLV identified in the raspberries was identical to that found in the patients (Gaulin et al. 1999). Expression of recombinant virus capsids in yeast and insect cells is allowing the development of ELISA\u2010based diagnostic assays, but reagents are not widely available and so far the tests only detect a very limited number of NLV strains (Jiang et al. 2000). Further development and more widespread use of ELISA tests will greatly facilitate the detection of NLVs in clinical samples, although such tests may not be sufficiently sensitive to detect virus in food samples.

Sewage sludge is sometimes applied to agricultural land, with the benefit that useful plant nutrients and organic matter are recycled to the soil. However, the UK government is proposing more stringent controls for harvesting vegetables from land where conventionally processed sewage sludge is applied (ADAS, 2000). The transmission of viruses is thought to be mainly by surface contamination. There are relatively few reported studies on the possible uptake of viruses within damaged plant tissues during primary growth. Studies with poliovirus report that virus can infiltrate into the roots and body of plants from the soil (Oron et al. 1995), but there is no evidence of illness from this source. Viruses from sewage do not bind readily with soil particles and can enter groundwaters leading to contamination of water sources.",

Large numbers of virus particles can be excreted in the faeces from an infected person. Levels of the order of 106\u20131011 infective units per gram have been estimated (Feachem et al. 1983). Poor personal hygiene is therefore a major route through which viruses can directly reach foods. Virus can be transferred from faecally contaminated fingers to foods or to work surfaces and door handles. There is a significant risk of contamination from field workers who do not have adequate on\u2010site toilet and hand\u2010washing facilities. Even when these facilities are put in place, the workers need to be supervised in such a way as to ensure that the facilities are used (Cliver 1994). In an outbreak of hepatitis A, associated with frozen raspberries, infection was confirmed in a fruit picker on the farm where the raspberries were cultivated (Ramsay and Upton 1989). A number of outbreaks have also been linked to contamination of fresh produce from the vomitus of infected food handlers (Caul et al. 1988). It has been suggested that between 20 and 30 million virus particles are liberated during vomiting (Reid et al. 1988; Caul 1994). As well as direct transmission, aerosols produced by vomiting can contaminate exposed food, or surfaces with subsequent transfer to foods.",

Mounting evidence suggests that viruses can survive long enough and in high enough numbers to cause human diseases through direct contact with polluted water or contaminated foods (Nasser 1994; Bosch 1995). Irving and Morris (1999) concluded that a thorough and valid assessment of the occurrence and significance of viruses in natural waters is hampered by lack of reliable information. They suggested that this is due to inefficient analytical techniques, and because different analytical methods have been used so that comparisons on survival data between different studies cannot be made. However, it does appear that different types of viruses are inactivated at different rates under identical conditions, and therefore no single microorganism can be expected to be an indicator for all viruses.",

A number of research studies have investigated the survival of human pathogenic viruses in soils with conflicting results. Survival appears to depend on a number of different variables, particularly the growing season, soil temperature, rainfall, soil type and composition. For example, viable poliovirus was recovered from spray\u2010irrigated soil after 96 days during the winter season (Sullivan and Tierney 1976; Tierney et al. 1977). This compared to a maximum survival period of only 11 days during the summer, which suggested the higher temperature and solar radiation levels in the warmer seasons accelerated viral inactivation. The possibility also exists that viruses may be mechanically transmitted to fruits and vegetables during harvest. Sadovski et al. (1978) noted the persistence of inoculated poliovirus in drip irrigation pipes and soil. Moderate environmental conditions and alluvial\u2010type soil, which restricts water infiltration, enhanced viral recoveries in the upper soil layers. Oron et al. (1995) found that relatively high soil temperature (30\u00b0C) and a low moisture content hindered poliovirus survival. Wet soil conditions are frequently associated with low soil temperature. Gerba (1983) reported that a large proportion of outbreaks of waterborne disease in the Unite States resulted from contaminated groundwater. Climate, the nature of the soil and the nature of the resident microflora determine virus survival and retention within soil particles. Both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions are thought to contribute towards virus adsorption and are controlled by the characteristics of the soil.",

(1994) observed that a range of enteric viruses, including hepatitis A virus and rotavirus, persisted for extended periods (greater than 30 days) on several types of porous and nonporous surfaces. Greater virus survival was noted at 4\u00b0C than at 20\u00b0C. The effect of relative humidity on survival of hepatitis A virus on non\u2010porous surfaces has been investigated (Bidawid et al. 2000; Sattar et al. 2000). At 5\u00b0C, relative humidity had little effect on survival time, but at 20\u00b0C survival was longest when relative humidity was low. It is apparent from the lingering outbreaks that have occurred on cruise ships that NLVs survive well on environmental surfaces. NLVs have been detected in swabs of lockers in hospital outbreaks and from hotel carpets (Green et al. 1998a; Barry\u2010Murphy et al. 2000). A disinfectant formulation is considered to be effective if it is capable of inducing a 1000\u2010fold (99\u00b79%) or greater reduction in the virus titre (Lloyd\u2010Evans et al. 1986; Springthorpe et al. 1986). Experimental studies have shown that a free chlorine level of 5000 ppm reduced the infectivity titre by more than 99\u00b79% on stainless\u2010steel disks contaminated with the enteric viruses Coxsackievirus B3 and hepatitis A virus, and the respiratory viruses adenovirus type 5, parainfluenza virus type 3 and coronavirus 229E (Sattar et al. 1989; Mbithi et al. 1990). The virucidal action of sodium hypochlorite (1250 ppm at pH 9\u00b756) was also tested against hepatitis A virus, human rotavirus and a Bacteroides fragilis bacteriophage dried on polystyrene (Abad et al. 1997a). Overall, a less than 1000\u2010fold titre reduction was achieved for all the viruses examined. Chlorine is a common disinfectant used by many fresh produce processors to wash fruits and vegetables (Beuchat 1998; Seymour 1999). However, chlorine levels greater than 200 ppm are thought to cause adverse discoloration (bleaching) and off flavours in the finished product (Hurst and Schuler 1992).",

Viral inactivation at room temperature (25\u00b0C) was significantly greater than at 4\u00b0C; however, viable rotavirus SA\u201011 was still detected on lettuce after 25 days. They concluded that the rough or irregular surfaces present on lettuce might offer some additional protection for virus particles. Indeed, protected segments of plants such as the roots, closed leaves and internal fruit parts, may offer favourable conditions that increase survival time up to 60 days (Smith 1982). Viable poliovirus was recovered from effluent spray\u2010irrigated lettuce and radishes 23 days after inoculation (Tierney and Sullivan 1976; Tierney et al. 1977). Sadovski et al.

Sewage sludge is applied to agricultural land, with the benefit that useful plant nutrients are recycled to the soil. In April 2000, the Agricultural Development and Advisory Service (ADAS, UK) published the Safe Sludge Matrix (ADAS, 2000). This document gives clear guidance on the minimum acceptable level of treatment for any sewage sludge applied to agricultural land and provides a framework to ensure microbiological safety. As from 31 December 1999 application of all untreated sludge on agricultural land used to grow food crops has been prohibited in the United Kingdom. Use on all agricultural land will be prohibited from the end of 2001. Untreated sludge is produced by either the primary settlement or secondary biological stages of sewage treatment. Further processing may be undertaken to produce treated sludge, resulting in improved stability and a reduction in health hazards and odour problems. (MAFF 1998).

Current recommendations state that food\u2010handlers should be allowed to return to work 48 h after symptoms have ceased. (PHLS 1993). These recommendations appear to work satisfactorily, but were based on the rapid decrease in virus excretion observed by electron microscopy. Using more sensitive PCR assays, NLVs can be detected for longer periods than electron microscopy and, in some instances, for up to a week after onset of symptoms. It is not clear if people shedding virus detectable by PCR are infectious, but recommendations on how long to exclude people from food\u2010handling need to be kept under review. The main period of excretion for hepatitis A virus is before symptoms become apparent and therefore control is difficult. The wearing of disposable gloves is recommended if foods are to be manipulated by hand, but this does not prevent transfer of viruses to gloves by touching contaminated surfaces.",

No vaccines have been developed for NLVs but research studies with NLV recombinant capsid antigens offer the potential for future development of vaccines. There are challenges, however, in designing effective vaccines in that first, there are multiple types of NLVs and secondly, the mechanisms for inducing immunity to these agents is poorly understood (Estes et al. 2000).",

Studies are therefore required to provide this information for NLVs and hepatitis A virus in particular. There is a need for information on rotaviruses and astroviruses. Both these viruses have been implicated in foodborne and waterborne outbreaks in the United Kingdom, although only very infrequently. The role and extent of food or waterborne transmission needs to be more clearly defined for both these viruses.",

NLVs cannot be cultured in vitro and culture techniques for hepatitis A virus are time\u2010consuming. Other viruses that can be cultured readily have been used as models for these pathogens in a number of studies. Although only the use of specific human pathogenic viruses will give clear and unequivocal data on survival, inactivation and removal, this is not always safe and practical. Model systems using similar non\u2010pathogenic human or mammalian viruses may be the most satisfactory alternative. For example, feline calicivirus has been used as a model system for NLVs in assessing the efficacy of commercially available disinfectants (Doultree et al. 1999). Feline calicivirus was also used as a model for NLVs in another study on the heat treatment of shellfish (Slomka and Appleton 1998). This organism would appear to be a good candidate for virus studies on fresh produce. In order to undertake studies on the survival and removal of viruses, there is a need to develop better methods for inoculation and recovery of virus from a range of fresh produce items.",

However, several authors have found no significant correlation (Keswick et al. 1982; Le Guyader et al. 1993). Despite the shortcomings of indicator organisms such as bacteriophages, there is a need for a safe and convenient model that can be used to help the food industry to assess and optimize new treatment processes. This is not intended as an indicator to monitor food samples directly. Other studies have shown that the behaviour and survival of bacteriophages mimic human viruses more closely than bacteria and would be suitable for such purposes. The optimization of washing and decontamination processes to remove viruses from fruits and vegetables will ultimately contribute to the overall safety of these food products.",
