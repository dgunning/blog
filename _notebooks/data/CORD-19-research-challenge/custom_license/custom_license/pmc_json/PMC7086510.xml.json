These recombinant bacterial strains will replicate the plasmid, producing large quantities of the target DNA6. A typical process of plasmid DNA generation includes the construction and selection of appropriate expression vectors, production of recombinant microorganisms and cell growth, followed by lysis of the cells, and the extraction and purification of plasmid DNA7. When the plasmids are extracted and purified, they usually result in one of two forms: either open-circled or supercoiled. However, when they are used in gene therapy or vaccine immunization, the plasmid with the supercoiled form is preferred. During plasmid DNA extraction, the step of lysing bacterial cells without losing plasmids is probably the most critical for downstream processing8, as the quantity of plasmid DNA recovered is mostly determined by this step after fermentation9,10.",

However, during alkaline lysis, precipitates form that contain cell debris, denatured proteins and nucleic acids, which must be removed. Centrifugation on a fixed-angle rotor is the most common operation during this process12,13 and is a rate-limiting step for a large-scale preparation14. An alternative method is boiling lysis, in which the 100 \u00b0C thermal treatment disrupts and makes cells release the plasmid DNA15. Although boiling lysis can isolate more plasmids than alkaline lysis, the inconsistent plasmid yield and purity, and the difficulty in operation, make this method undesirable even for laboratory research-scale preparations16. For large-scale production, a high-pressure homogenizer is used to continuously disrupt cells17. However, this often causes problems in collecting fragmented DNA plasmids and more contaminated genomic DNA due to its severe fluid dynamic forces for destruction17. Therefore, the development of a highly efficient continuous lysis and scalable protocol becomes a challenging but important issue.",

            "text": "Based on the conventional boiling lysis protocol18, Lee and Lander have made several modifications to improve the method19,20. Although these modifications significantly improve the efficiency of boiling lysis and the yield of plasmid DNA, they require centrifugation steps at the bacterial-collecting and plasmid-extracting stage, special equipment and reagents. In a recent report21, we described a design for a flow-through protocol from cultured bacteria for the extraction of plasmid DNA. The schematic design of the device and set-up is shown in Figure 1. The use of a 0.2 \u03bcm pore size hollow fiber-membrane module to harvest the fermented bacteria will minimize the centrifugation step, which is one of the limiting steps in large-scale preparation. Pumping through the heat-exchanging coils, cells receive uniform thermal treatment regardless of the volume of the sample, which ensures continuity and homogeneity of cell lysis. The diameter of copper coils can vary, depending on the volume of fermentation. This provides versatility for any given volume of samples. This protocol does not aim to increase the yield of plasmid, but to provide consistency between batches, which can otherwise be lacking in boiling lysis methods. A centrifugation step is, however, still required to separate the plasmid-containing supernatant from the lysed bacteria, which will require further optimization. Overall, this protocol provides a scalable, efficient and cost-effective preparation system to meet the needs of large-scale plasmid production for both laboratories and industry. The protocol mainly details the lysis of cells and the extraction of plasmid DNA, and although further purification procedures may be required, they are not explained in detail within this protocol.",

It may be necessary to plate 10 \u03bcl and 100 \u03bcl of transformed bacteria onto different plates to obtain appropriate colony separation.Pick a single recombinant bacterial colony carrying the target plasmid and seed onto 10 ml of antibiotic-selective LB medium.Critical StepSelect a single well-separated E. coli colony and use it for seed culturing.Incubate at 37 \u00b0C overnight at 200 rpm in an orbital shaker for 10\u201312 h.Critical StepThe bacteria should not be used to seed cultures beyond their log phase (if their OD value is more than 0.6), otherwise a low yield of plasmid can occur.Inoculate 5 ml of the seed bacteria onto 50 ml of LB medium containing an appropriate amount of antibiotics, and incubate at 37 \u00b0C for an additional 12 h in the orbital shaker.Inoculate 50 ml culture into 4 l of semi-synthesized media with antibiotics in an automatically controlled fermentor.Ferment using the following conditions: set the temperature at 37 \u00b0C and the dissolved oxygen (DO) at 30%. Maintain the pH at 7.0 by the addition of ammonium hydroxide solution (30%) and 5 M hydrochloric acid (HCl). Set the inflow sparge air to 7 l min\u22121 and add 400 ml of feeding media at the rate of 20 ml h\u22121. It takes 10\u201312 h to complete the fermentation, but it can be varied and is dependent on the bacteria used.Critical StepDuring fermentation, a constant volume of DO should be maintained at 30%; when DO is more than 30%, the bacteria will grow quicker, but the plasmid copies will be lost as the plasmid could not replicate quickly enough to keep up with the rapid cell division. We found the optimal DO value to be 30% in different bacterial strains and different plasmid DNAs.To monitor cell growth, collect a sample of 2 ml of the culture every 2 h during fermentation to determine the density at OD 600 nm, and stop the fermentation once the density reaches a plateau after two consecutive readings.\n",

The flow rate of fermented culture must be deliberately controlled to allow the liquid to pass into the module and through the fiber membrane, discharging into the waste container (C1), while keeping the retained cells on the outside of the membrane and so inside of the column. The permeate flow control can be achieved by reducing or increasing the feed pump (P1) velocity to reduce or to increase the inlet transmembrane pressure. Outlet valve V2 must be open to allow waste discharge into C1.11When all the fermented culture has been pumped into the module and discharged into the waste container, leaving the concentrated bacteria within the module, switch inlet valve V1 to allow one bed volume of TE buffer to be pumped into the module by pump P1 to rinse cells as the V2 remains open to discharge the rinsed TE buffer into C1.12Close outlet valve V2 and increase the feed pump (P1) velocity by 1.5\u20132 times to increase the inlet pressure of TE, in order to discharge cells from the module through the top outlet into C2 container.Pause pointThe concentrated cells can be stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until use.

We have found this to be an optimal time period for the thermal lysis of cells; however, other times may be tested if an optimal yield can not be obtained. As indicated in Figure 2, the temperatures of 70 \u00b0C and 80 \u00b0C achieved a higher yield of plasmids with a minimum contamination with genomic DNA. However, 70 \u00b0C is probably the most appropriate setting in terms of the balance between energy costs and the quality of plasmids produced. An immediate connection from the heating coil to the coil submerged in ice should be used to avoid excess lysis.\n",
