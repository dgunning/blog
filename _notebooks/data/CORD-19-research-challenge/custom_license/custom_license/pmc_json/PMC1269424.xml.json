Infectious diseases, whether they be natural or the result of bioterrorism, have the potential to create a large influx of critically ill patients, and disaster management planning should take such eventualities into account. This need was demonstrated in February 2003, when a new illness \u2013 SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) \u2013 spread from the People's Republic of China to 28 countries, resulting in 8096 probable cases with 774 deaths [2]. This review explores the Toronto critical care experience of coping in a disaster outbreak situation. By sharing our experiences and our coping strategies, we hope that others will learn from our successes and avoid the problems we encountered, many of which were a direct result of lack of preparedness. We hope that this review will encourage others to make plans to cope with similar outbreaks in the future, should they occur.",

Likewise, it is expected that other emerging infectious agents will pose diagnostic challenges. Because of this, as infected individuals present to medical institutions where staff are unprepared, the risk for spread is considerable. An outbreak situation may arise quickly and without much warning, taxing the resources of any health care system and the ability of its personnel to cope. The most fundamental guidance we offer is that you need to have a plan in advance. Since 11 September 2001, the USA and other countries have run exercises to prepare for attacks, including bioterrorism [7-12]. We believe that, based on the way in which SARS crippled our health care system (in particular critical care delivery) and dealt significant blows to our economy, a great deal could be gained from simulating similar events and planning a system wide response to emerging pathogens.",

In Toronto one of the greatest challenges that arose was handling the uncertainty of exactly what level of precautions were needed to ensure staff safety. This was an issue that had to be addressed immediately because getting appropriate staff to work required that they felt as protected as possible. Anecdotally, we found in some centres that distrust occasionally emerged between front-line health care workers and leadership. This may have been due to several issues, including the following: there was no clear system-wide communication strategy, and as a result rumours and speculation frequently went unchecked; infection control and other recommendations changed frequently, leading many individuals to question the validity of previous directives; and confusion over whether the responsible virus could be airborne and variable use of airborne versus droplet protection. Of note, subsequent evidence suggests that airborne transmission may in fact be possible [16]. In retrospect, we believe a city-wide, consistent and regular communication strategy (which occurred in some institutions) that acknowledged the fact that leadership was making decisions in the face of uncertainty would have minimized the distrust.",

Disaster planning for these circumstances is unique in that it challenges us to develop practical means to conduct ongoing, widespread surveillance and screening [1,11,13], particularly in light of unclear prodromes and illness presentations and in the absence of diagnostic testing. There is a need to develop a team to track and follow potential epidemiological linkages quickly and to engage in surveillance for de novo cases. This team will potentially have to collaborate across wide geographical regions, engage in open discussion of uncertainty, and develop a surveillance and quarantine strategy that is practical, as comprehensive as possible and does not needlessly isolate individuals and restrict their freedoms. In the face of uncertain diagnostic criteria, it is important to acknowledge that some individuals will be isolated needlessly and some infected asymptomatic individuals will be missed, leading to new cases with the potential to perpetuate the outbreak. It is important that the surveillance team does not seek to assign blame under these circumstances; instead, an analysis of each 'failed' surveillance or error should be undertaken to improve overall knowledge of disease transmission and presentation, and to prevent other infected individuals from falling through the cracks. From the critical care point of view, it is important that there is a feedback loop from these surveillance teams to the critical care leadership, so that that subsequent reliable communication and preparation can be assured.",

Indeed, internet-based technology proved invaluable during the SARS outbreak in Toronto by allowing our experiences and our newly, on occasion painfully, gained knowledge to be shared with other affected centres and countries. Colleagues in unaffected countries were warned and prepared (for example, see SARS resources [17]).

During an outbreak, providing support does not necessarily require a complicated plan. Providing meals or refreshments to staff working in cumbersome, hot and heavy protective gear, and providing safe areas to relax in are simple, easy and well appreciated means to convey support. The presence of leaders who are prepared to risk their own health alongside front-line staff, who listen to staff concerns and address them to the best of their ability, and who discuss and/or reiterate management plans is another straightforward means to provide much needed support and a boost to staff morale. It is important that leadership demonstrate willingness to participate in the front-line environment. Finally, consideration of the need for management of post-traumatic stress disorder, in consultation with psychiatric colleagues, is prudent, and such investment is likely to prevent some of the long-term disability we have seen.",

As seen with SARS [22] and the emergence of HIV [25-27], most health care providers never anticipated being in a situation that put their personal safety, health and potentially their lives and those of their families on the line. Questions arose regarding whether there is a duty to care and how much personal risk should be expected [22]. Some refused to care for SARS patients, and some refused to even enter wards containing SARS patients [22]. Others demanded 'danger pay' and compensation for illness and quarantine. Understandably, some worried about the extent of their disability and life insurance coverage. These views raised further challenges, fracturing the front-line teams who found themselves asking what, if anything, made their colleagues' lives more 'valuable' than their own. Issues of duty to care and of balancing personal risk and professional obligations remain for a large part unanswered. Further research and debate is required. Disaster planning must, however, consider whether such issues are likely to arise and include potential strategies to deal with them. Consideration should be given to developing means to decrease the anxiety regarding transmission of illness to family members; these could include child care and arranging the provision of alternate living quarters for staff, among others.",

This was a big problem because our occupancy rates were already unacceptably high. This supply issue will become a crucial concern in any future outbreak or disaster situation. In addition to our problem with bed availability, the human resources component further exacerbated the problem; the staff numbers were reduced by fear of contracting the disease, quarantine and illness. When SARS transmission occurred in ICUs, entire units were quarantined for 12\u201314 days. Of tertiary care university medical/surgical ICU beds and community ICU beds in Toronto, 38% and 33%, respectively, were closed at some point [28]. Maintaining provision of ICU services to non-SARS patients became an important consideration as the outbreak progressed. In anticipation of future outbreaks, plans to organize critical care resources to meet the needs of all critically ill patients should be developed. For example, critical care beds can be rapidly augmented by other areas of the hospital that are adequately equipped (e.g. recovery rooms, operating rooms, emergency rooms, etc.).",

The scope of future outbreaks or disasters will always be uncertain, but, potentially, critical care providers will need to be able to care for many, many more patients very quickly. Because most ICUs currently function at very high occupancy rates, absorbing such additional numbers is unimaginable. Meeting these needs clearly requires us to move from institution-based to system-based thinking. In addition, critical care providers must be prepared to make tough decisions regarding triage and standards of care. Critical care providers should pre-develop engineering plans to isolate wards, rather than those that were developed by necessity on-the-fly in Toronto.",

Consideration should be given to designating specific hospitals as main centres for screening suspected cases and treating those affected; identifying hospitals to meet general and those to meet more specialized care needs of other critically ill patients; devising means to increase critical care resources within the affected region; and identifying institutions to decant certain patients to (e.g. alternate level of care patients) and to provide for specific ongoing needs of the population (e.g. cardiac services).",

Such measures may also result in faster disease containment (by decreasing breaches in infection control) and better patient care as the teams become more familiar with the disease. Unlike the Toronto experience, in which SARS hospitals were designated late in the outbreak, SARS hospitals in other countries experienced little to no transmission to staff [30]. In Toronto, entire ICUs were quarantined as a result of transmission of SARS to staff [28]. Subsequently, provision of critical care to both SARS patients and all other critically ill patients was jeopardized. Although designation of outbreak hospitals seems a simple solution, it is not as easy as it appears. For example, finding staff willing to work in such a setting is a challenge. In addition, such a plan does not preclude other hospitals from knowing how to deal with the illness because, for the most part, the diagnosis is not clear for several days and originating hospitals will need to be prepared to manage patients until that point. Furthermore, designated hospitals will need access to other medical services as affected individuals develop other complications. Finally, the act of transporting such contagious individuals is not without considerable risk, and hence transportation requires careful planning. We recommend that regions develop and, importantly, test plans for working as a system during a disaster like this.",
