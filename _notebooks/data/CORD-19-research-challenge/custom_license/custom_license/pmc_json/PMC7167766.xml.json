The diagnosis of KD is based on the following criteria: presence of fever for \u22655 days and four or more of the five principal clinical features which include polymorphous exanthem, extremity changes, mucosal changes involving the lips and oral cavity, bilateral bulbar conjunctival injection, and unilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, which appear sequentially in a cascade.1 The diagnosis has to be made on clinical grounds alone as there is no pathognomonic laboratory test for confirmation. The clinical course of KD can be divided into three phases2: (a) Acute febrile phase\u2014lasts for initial 10\u201014 days; characterized by fever, muco\u2010cutaneous changes and other less commonly recognized findings such as hydrops of gall bladder, sterile pyuria and myocarditis; (b) Sub\u2010acute phase\u2014lasts from weeks 2\u20104 after symptom onset; characterized by periungual desquamation and coronary abnormalities along with resolution of principal clinical features; (c) Convalescent phase\u2014characterized by complete resolution of clinical signs and laboratory parameters. Exact etiology of KD remains unknown, though various hypotheses on the role of micro\u2010organisms and superantigens have been postulated.2\n",
