It also appears that clinicians were reluctant to stop antibiotics prior to discharge in children in whom other viruses were identified, even when these provide a plausible aetiological explanation for the child's LRTI.

The benefits include a better understanding of the changes in prevalence of particular viruses in LRTI in the community, the ability to provide more definitive information for the parents on the aetiology of the child's infection and the potential to reduce the amount of antibiotics children receive.

Many clinicians may feel uncomfortable not prescribing antibiotics in children with LRTI, particularly those severe enough to need hospitalisation, and start empiric antibiotics routinely. Diagnostic tests for bacterial infections of the lower respiratory tract are limited and insensitive in young children which may contribute to this practice. However, it makes sense to stop antibiotics when the clinical presentation is consistent with infection by a virus identified on NPS sample.",
