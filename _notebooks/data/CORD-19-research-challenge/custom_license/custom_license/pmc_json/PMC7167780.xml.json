Since the clinical course and length of hospital stay varied widely from child to child, a substantial quantity of serum cytokine data was missing. To account for missing data and irregular intervals between serial serum cytokine collections, we used a generalized linear mixed\u2010effect model for comparing the slope of changes in the serial serum cytokines among the survivors and non\u2010survivors.24 We evaluated the slope of changes as estimate values with standard errors. Also, we used the slope comparison test for comparing the trend of TGF\u2010\u03b21 and the trends of the other cytokines according to survival. The differences of the trend of TGF\u2010\u03b21 and the trends of the other cytokines were significant in P < 0.05 and the more close to zero the value of estimates were, the more significant the relationship with the trend of TGF\u2010\u03b21 and the trends of the other cytokines were.",

It is the only study of acute lung injury due to a toxic inhalant that provides information about the pathophysiology, related therapeutic considerations, and prognostic factors, as determined by analyzing serial changes in cytokines, instead of single data. The most important limitations are the very limited number of patients and the analyzing of the only blood samples without any lung tissue and exudates, but it was inevitable because the clinical course of HD\u2010chILD was severe, aggressive, and unpredictable. The small number of subjects, plus the irregular sampling and substantial quantity of missing cytokine data, made the statistical analysis difficult, although a generalized mixed model called a spaghetti plot was used to help overcome this.
