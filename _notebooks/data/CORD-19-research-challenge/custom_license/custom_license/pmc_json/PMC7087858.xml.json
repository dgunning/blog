The inappropriate assembly of modular components plays a role in oncogenic transformation and other diseases and can be exploited for therapeutic purposes. These target structures, however, are conventionally considered as \u201cnot druggable\u201d. As protein\u2013protein interactions are mediated by surface structures of folded proteins, peptides embedded in the context of a scaffold protein can serve as competitive inhibitors of protein recognition modules. Such peptide aptamers can target non-canonical drug binding sites and disrupt intracellular protein functions. Applications of this principle are dependent upon the binding specificities and affinities of the peptide aptamers to their target structures, recombinant expression, and purification of the peptide aptamer-scaffold protein and delivery of the purified protein into cells. We improved upon the scaffold structure and utilized the human thioredoxin molecule. Removal of five internal cysteines allows the purification of a monomeric protein with high yield. Provision of this molecule with a protein transduction domain, consisting of nine arginines, results in a fusion protein, which is taken up efficiently by cultured cells, inhibits intracellular signaling functions and associated cellular phenotypes. A peptide aptamer which recognizes the intracellular part of the ErbB2 receptor was introduced into breast cancer cells. They reduced the extent of AKT kinase induction upon heregulin treatment of the cells and enhanced resistance towards chemotherapeutic agents in ErbB2 overexpressing cancer cells. A peptide aptamer directed against the dimerization domain of the transcription factor Stat3 prevented Stat3-mediated transactivation and induced growth inhibition and the induction of apoptosis.",

The probability of long-term survival after relapse from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is predicted from well-established prognostic, mainly clinical, factors. However, the underlying biological determinants of these prognostic factors are poorly understood. In collaboration with the department of Pediatric Oncology that houses the BFM ALL-REZ study group, we have defined molecular prognostic markers for risk stratification, identified gene expression programs that characterize ALL pathogenesis in patients with poor outcome, and searched for genes that modulate therapeutic approaches. We found that early onset relapse of ALL, which is typically associated with a particularly low event-free survival rate, is distinguished from late disease recurrence by an increased proliferative capacity of leukemic blasts and a distinct expression of genes with functions in cell cycle control, particularly during the process of mitosis. In addition, by employing a genetic shRNA screen, we have identified sets of genes that modulate therapeutic approaches in cell culture-based models. The implications will be discussed.",

It has been shown that YB-1 regulates the expression of a number of genes linked to cell proliferation and growth. In addition, YB-1 is a multifunctional protein involved in regulating translation, mRNA splicing, and DNA repair, indicating that YB-1 is involved in controlling cell survival. In recent years, several laboratories have demonstrated that YB-1 in response to genotoxic stress like chemotherapy translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Besides transcriptional activation of the human MDR1 and MRP1 genes, nuclear localization of the transcription factor YB-1 is associated with base excision and mismatch repair pathways through binding to several DNA repair proteins. YB-1 is found amongst others highly overexpressed in many malignancies, and current results suggest that YB-1 is important in conferring, e.g., drug resistance in many types of tumor cells. Oncolytic adenoviruses have attracted considerable attention for their use as an innovative class of promising cancer therapeutics. We have developed several oncolytic adenoviral vectors which replicate in the presence of YB-1 in tumor cells. The application of YB-1-dependent oncolytic vectors produces a strong antitumor effect in several carcinoma cell lines, and application in vivo in subcutaneous established tumors led to strong tumor growth inhibition, which could further be enhanced by radiation and chemotherapy. In conclusion, YB-1-dependent adenoviruses are highly effective against different malignancies and deserve further clinical testing.",

Hundreds of transcriptional targets are up-regulated or down-regulated on transition from the normal to the Ras-transformed state. A minority of targets is equally deregulated in different cell types, indicating that there exist a limited number of common Ras pathway targets. The set of up-regulated genes comprises factors involved in growth control, invasion, and metastasis, while many down-regulated genes encode proteins with anti-proliferative, anti-invasive, and anti-angiogenic properties. The involvement of most of the deregulated genes in triggering or executing various aspects of malignant transformation is unknown. Moreover, the global mechanisms controlling their expression are not yet understood. To unravel the regulatory mechanisms perturbing the transcriptional networks downstream of the Ras signaling cascade and to find out which of the targets are primarily involved in tumorigenesis, we are employing several experimental strategies: We have narrowed down the number of critical targets by correlating the effects of blocking individual effector pathways, using pharmacological inhibitors or RNA interference, with the transcriptional patterns and specific phenotypes. We have selected a few targets exhibiting significant differential expression in Ras-transformed vs normal cells for RNA interference experiments. To study the role of DNA methylation in target gene suppression, we subjected Ras-transformed cells to treatment with demethylating agents and determined the fraction of responding targets. As an example, we have shown that clusterin gene suppression is controlled by promoter methylation and by the MAPK-pathway, suggesting a dynamic relationship between Ras signaling and DNA methylation.",

Tumorigenesis is widely recognized as an intricate multistep process that involves malfunction in protooncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and other key cellular genes implicated in cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and genome integrity. Malfunction of protooncogenes and signaling components has been reported. Among them, the Ras/Raf/MEK [mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK kinase]/ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) signaling components have been identified to play important roles in tumorigenesis.

Here, we report that hRJL, a nucleus-localized representative of RJL family, can mediate the accumulation of active MEK1/2 in the nucleus by masking the NES of MEK1/2, which in turn results in constitutive activation of ERK1/2 and malignant transformation. We show that hRJL is overexpressed in most of the tumor cells and tumor tissues and is oncogenic both in vitro and in vivo. Silencing of hRJL expression or disruption of hRJL-MEK1/2 interaction results in regression of tumor growth and metastasis. Our findings suggest that hRJL-mediated nuclear entrapment of MEK1/2 plays important roles in promotion of autonomous tumor progression, and hRJL is a novel oncogenic therapeutic target.",

He stated that cobalt chloride and desferrioxamine-mimicked hypoxia and moderate hypoxia can trigger acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells to undergo differentiation, and intermittent hypoxia significantly prolongs the survival of the transplanted leukemic mice through inducing growth arrest and differentiation with inhibition of leukemic blast infiltration. Based on these in vitro and in vivo observations, we explore the role of hypoxia-inducible factor 1(HIF-1), a protein in leukemic cell differentiation. Our results show that the conditional HIF-1a induction triggers granulocytic differentiation of myeloid leukemic U937T transformants in which HIF-1a is tightly induced by tetracycline withdrawal. The suppression of HIF-1a expression, but not HIF-1b (an essential partner for transcription activity of HIF-1), by specific short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) effectively inhibits hypoxia-induced differentiation of U937 cells. Further, the inhibition of hematopoietic differentiation-critical CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-alpha (C/EBPa) significantly eliminates HIF-1a-mediated myeloid leukemic cell differentiation. Furthermore, HIF-1a is also shown to interact physically with and to increase the transcriptional activity of C/EBPa and AML1, two critical factors for granulocytic differentiation. Collectively, this work provides several lines of direct evidence for the role of HIF-1a protein through its non-transcriptional activity in myeloid cell differentiation in which C/EBPa elicits a role as an effector downstream to HIF-1a. These discoveries would shed new insights for understanding mechanisms underlying leukemogenesis and designing the new therapeutic strategy for differentiation induction of AML.",

The constructed bispecific antibodies (SM5.1-Flt3L, Anti-her2-Flt3L, and anti-CD20-Flt3L) efficiently target hepatoma, breast, and lymphoma cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo, leading to accumulation of DCs, NK cells, and lymphocytes in local tumor tissues. Administration of these bispecific monoclonal antibodies can protect bone marrow injury caused by chemotherapeutic drugs and stimulates proliferation and maturation of lymphocytes, APCs, and NKs. Systemic administration of these bispecific antibodies (100 \u03bcg/each injection \u00d7 3) significantly inhibited tumor growth and cured established tumors. These bispecific therapeutic proteins are effective in elicitation of long-lasting antitumor immunity. The tumor-specific immunity can be adoptively transferred into na\u00efve animals successfully by transfusion of CD3+CD8+ T cells from the treated mice. The results suggest that fusion of Flt3L with therapeutic antibodies can create novel immunotherapeutic proteins, which are more effective in induction of antitumor immunity, and may provide a novel strategy for treatment of cancers.",

Steroid receptor coactivators (SRCs) exert profound effects on animal development and physiology. These coactivators are nuclear proteins and transcription co-regulators that function to facilitate the transcription initiation mediated by nuclear receptors as well as by other well-known transcription factors. However, how these co-regulators are functionally regulated is poorly understood. During genome-wide screening for SRC-interacting proteins, we identified a novel ankyrin-repeat-containing protein, SRC-interacting protein (SIP), which interacts with SRC coactivators in the cytoplasm. We demonstrated that extracellular stimuli, such as the addition of estrogen, induced phosphorylation of SIP in its PEST (proline, glutamate, serine, and threonine-rich) domain by casein kinase II. The phosphorylation of SIP resulted in dissociation of SRC proteins from SIP in the cytoplasm and led to subsequent nuclear translocation of SRC proteins and gene coactivation. Both gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments indicate that SIP functions to sequester SRC coactivators in the cytoplasm and buffer the availability of these coactivators, thus, providing a mechanism for the regulation of the transcription regulators.",

The expression levels of SIRP\u03b11 were decreased in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues, as compared with the matched normal tissues. Exogenous expression of wild-type SIRP\u03b11, but not of a mutant SIRP\u03b11 lacking the tyrosine phosphorylation sites, in SIRP\u03b11 negative Huh7 human HCC cells resulted in suppression of tumor cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Treatment of Huh7 transfectants with EGF or HGF induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SIRP\u03b11 and its association with SHP-2, which were accompanied by reduced ERK1 activation. Expression of SIRP\u03b11 significantly suppressed activation of NF-\u03baB and also sensitized Huh7 cells to TNF\u03b1 or cisplatin-induced cell death. In addition, SIRP\u03b11-transfected Huh7 cells displayed reduced cell migration and cell spreading in a fashion that was dependent on SIRP\u03b11/SHP-2 complex formation. In conclusion, these results suggest a negative regulatory effect of SIRP\u03b11 on hepatocarcinogenesis through, at least in part, inhibition of ERK and NF-\u03baB pathway. The heightened sensitivity of cells restoring SIRP\u03b11 function could be exploited in the development of therapeutic regimens which may potentiate the antineoplastic effect of conventional cytokines or chemotherapeutic agents.",

The essence of successful mitosis in mammalian cells is the generation of two genetically identical daughter cells. The successful mitosis requires the assembly of a strictly bipolar mitotic apparatus that will ensure that chromosomes equally distribute to the daughter cells. This process is controlled by the centrosomes that are required for spindle formation and function. Centrosome stability is required for the successful mitosis in mammalian cells. Amplification of centrosome leads to chromosomal missegregation and generation of aneuploidy, which are closely associated with cell transformation and tumorigenesis. The machinery that controls centrosome stability involves multiple important cellular proteins, including p53, BRCA1, Gadd45, p21, and Cdk2/cyclin E. The precise coordination among those regulators maintains centrosome duplication and stability. However, there are currently limited insights into mechanism(s) for this critical biological event.",

Suppression of endogenous Bacp results in aberrant spindle formation, failure of chromosomal segregation and cytokinesis, and aneuploidy. Bacp is overexpressed in human breast and lung carcinomas, and its deregulation is in part associated with BACP amplification. Bacp exhibits strong oncogenic property and induces NIH3T3 fibroblast transformation. Importantly, Bacp transgenic mice mimic the phenotypes of disrupted BRCA1, including centrosome amplification and spontaneous tumorigenesis.
