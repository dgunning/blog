            "text": "The mechanism(s) of initiation and perpetuation of multiple sclerosis (MS), a human immune\u2010mediated demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) are unknown. Clinical and epidemiological studies suggest that both genetic and environmental factors are important in the initiation and pathogenesis of MS 1. Viral infections have been associated with other demyelinating CNS diseases, both in humans and animals 2\u20135, and various environmental factors have been associated with the initiation and exacerbation of MS, including viral infections 6, 7. MS is believed to be mediated by myelin\u2010specific CD4+ T cells. Although myelin\u2010specific autoreactive T cells can be isolated from the blood of normal healthy individuals, they do not have an activated phenotype. Therefore, a critical question is how do these cells become activated in MS patients? One potential mechanism is molecular mimicry, whereby autoreactive T cells may be cross\u2010activated by epitopes from infectious agents that share structural or sequence homology to self antigens 8, 9. Direct evidence for molecular mimicry in human autoimmune disease is difficult to obtain and support is limited to demonstration of in vitro reactivation of myelin\u2010specific T cell clones from MS patients by panels of antigens from infectious agents 10. In this regard, molecular mimicry between the U24 protein of human herpesvirus\u20106 (HHV\u20106), a virus that may be associated with MS, and a candidate autoantigenic epitope for MS, MBP96\u2013102, has recently been demonstrated 11.",

            "text": "Therefore, better understanding of the potential mechanisms of molecular mimicry\u2010induced autoreactive T cell activation is important in elucidating the pathogenesis of MS. Previously, we demonstrated that infection of SJL mice with a non\u2010pathogenic strain of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) encoding a myelin mimic peptide from Haemophilus influenzae (HI) can cross\u2010activate myelin proteolipid protein (PLP)139\u2013151\u2010specific CD4+ Th1 cells and induce an atypical CNS autoimmune disease 12, 13. The HI mimic peptide shares 6 of 13 amino acids with the major encephalitogenic peptide in SJL mice, PLP139\u2013151. Although the sequence identity between the peptides is only 46%, structural identity of amino acids at the primary MHC class II (I\u2010As) and TCR contact residues is vital to the mechanism of molecular mimicry 14. Another potential PLP139\u2013151 mimic peptide has been identified from murine hepatitis virus (MHV), a single\u2010stranded RNA coronavirus 15. The MHV3821\u20133832 mimic peptide only shares 3 of 13 amino acids with PLP139\u2013151 (23% homology), including the primary TCR and MHC class II contact residues, but neither the secondary MHC class II proline residue nor the secondary TCR contact residue. The MHV peptide binds I\u2010As and induces limited activation of T cell clones derived from PLP139\u2013151\u2010primed SJL mice 15 and a proline residue at position 9 (p9) of the MHC binding motif is important for binding to I\u2010As\n16.",

Finally, we demonstrate that autoimmune disease can be initiated in mice infected with replicating virus engineered to express the natural MHV mimic sequence, but not by immunization with the MHV peptide in CFA. Therefore, this paper highlights the structural requirements of pathogen\u2010derived myelin mimic peptides and the critical importance of studying a \u201clive\u201d infection concomitant to presentation of mimic peptides.",

            "text": "A previous investigation had identified a potential PLP139\u2013151 molecular mimic peptide expressed by MHV 15. We thus asked if this mimic peptide could cross\u2010prime/activate PLP139\u2013151\u2010specific T cells. Following the immunization of mice with PLP139\u2013151 or a PLP 30\u2010mer peptide (PLP130\u2013159) encompassing the core PLP139\u2013151 encephalitogenic epitope, in CFA, 100% of SJL mice exhibited a typical acute\u2010phase disease course of EAE (Table 1). In contrast, mice immunized with the PLP139\u2013151 mimic peptide, MHV3821\u20133832 (MHV), or an MHV 30\u2010mer peptide (MHV3813\u20133842) containing the MHV3821\u20133832 minimal epitope did not exhibit clinical disease (Table 1). The ability of MHV immunization to induce the cross\u2010activation of PLP139\u2013151\u2010specific T cells was measured by in vivo delayed\u2010type hypersensitivity (DTH) and in vitro T cell proliferation assays. DTH rechallenge with PLP139\u2013151 in MHV\u2010immunized mice on day 16 post immunization did not cross\u2010activate PLP139\u2013151\u2010specific T cells; however, PLP139\u2013151 DTH responses were significantly higher in PLP139\u2013151\u2010immunized mice compared to MHV\u2010 or OVA\u2010immunized mice, or naive mice (\u00a7\np <0.05) (Fig. 1A). MHV\u2010immunized mice had significantly greater DTH responses following rechallenge with MHV compared to control groups (*p <0.05) and, interestingly, PLP139\u2013151\u2010immunized mice responded to both PLP139\u2013151 and MHV rechallenge, suggesting unidirectional molecular mimicry (Fig. 1A). We also tested whether the putative MHV\u2010encoded PLP\u2010mimic sequence was a natural epitope for SJL mice in the context of I\u2010As. Mice immunized to the 30\u2010mer MHV3813\u20133842 peptide, encompassing the candidate PLP139\u2013151 mimic epitope, demonstrated DTH responses in vivo (Fig. 1A) and in vitro proliferative responses (Fig. 1B) upon rechallenge with the MHV short peptide, indicating that the short\u2010length mimic MHV epitope may be processed by APC and induce MHV\u2010specific T cell responses. However, in contrast to the in vivo DTH data, in vitro MHV rechallenge in both PLP\u2010immunized groups of mice did not induce T cell proliferation (Fig. 1B). This result may reflect the differences between in vitro and in vivo antigen processing and the sensitivity of the microenvironment in vivo to peptide rechallenge. In contrast, MHV\u2010immunized mice responded to in vitro rechallenge with the PLP139\u2013151 peptide, albeit at a significantly lower level than rechallenge of PLP\u2010immunized mice (Fig. 1C). Anti\u2010CD3 antibody stimulation of T cells from peptide\u2010immunized mice was equivalent between all groups (Fig. 1B, C).",

Clinical disease was not induced in either group compared with the positive control mice immunized with PLP139\u2013151 (Table 2). To determine whether MHV+P immunization induced cross\u2010reactive PLP139\u2013151 proliferative responses, mice were rechallenged in vitro with either the immunizing peptide or PLP139\u2013151 on day 14 following peptide immunization. Rechallenge with PLP139\u2013151 in PLP139\u2013151\u2010immunized mice induced significant T cell proliferation compared to control groups (Fig. 3A).

In MHV\u2010immunized mice, in vitro rechallenge with MHV induced the greatest proliferative response, as expected, and a lesser response in MHV+P\u2010immunized mice (Fig. 3B). Responses in PLP139\u2013151\u2010 and OVA323\u2013339\u2010immunized mice were similar to those of naive mice (Fig. 3B). Rechallenge with MHV+P induced strong responses in both MHV\u2010 and MHV+P\u2010immunized mice (Fig. 3C).

Surprisingly, MHV rechallenge induced a significantly greater IFN\u2010\u03b3 response (Fig. 3G) in MHV+P\u2010immunized mice compared to MHV\u2010immunized mice. The populations of cells that respond to MHV or PLP can be thought of as separate populations in which some cells can be cross\u2010activated by mimic peptides.

MHV3821\u20133832 is another potential PLP139\u2013151 mimic peptide with 23% homology to the major encephalitogenic peptide in SJL mice, PLP139\u2013151\n15. Although the majority of the amino acid sequence is different between the natural PLP and viral MHV peptides, they share similar primary TCR (W at p5) and MHC class II (K at p4) contact residues. MHV3821\u20133832 is located in the ORF1a gene which codes for the replicative polyprotein PL1\u2010PRO (Papain\u2010like proteinases), a multifunctional protein involved in the transcription of negative\u2010stranded RNA, leader RNA, subgenomic mRNA and progeny virion RNA, as well as cleaving the polyprotein into functional products located at the N terminus of the replicase polyprotein. We and others have demonstrated that immunization of SJL mice with HI574\u2013586 can induce expansion of PLP139\u2013151\u2010specific T cells, although Th1 differentiation is minimal and mice do not exhibit clinical signs of CNS autoimmune disease even after multiple immunizations in CFA \u00b1 pertussis toxin and/or LPS as additional innate immune stimuli 12, 13, 15. It has been proposed that the sequence of mimic peptides need not be homologous to self peptides; rather, homology at the key structural TCR and MHC residues is important for mimicry. Our study of the properties of the MHV mimic peptide confirms that of Carrizosa et al. 15, as although immunization of SJL mice with the MHV mimic epitope induced a robust recall T cell response to MHV peptide, we observed only minor PLP139\u2013151\u2010induced recall responses, particularly IFN\u2010\u03b3 production. Nevertheless, these data demonstrated the potential for cross\u2010activation of PLP139\u2013151 T cells by the MHV peptide. In PLP139\u2013151\u2010immunized mice, we also observed a trend towards cross\u2010reactivity following recall with the MHV mimic peptide. To further confirm these initial observations, we demonstrated that despite limited cross\u2010reactivity between the MHV and PLP peptides, MHV3821\u20133832 peptide\u2010coupled splenocyte tolerance of PLP139\u2013151\u2010induced EAE was ineffective at inhibiting disease and T cell recall responses, in contrast to PLP139\u2013151\u2010 or HI574\u2013586\u2010induced tolerance.",

Secondly, we wanted to establish whether viral delivery of the MHV mimic peptide could overcome the threshold necessary for cross\u2010reactive activation of pathogenic, autoreactive PLP\u2010specific Th1 cells similar to what we had previously reported for disease induction by the HI574\u2013586 mimic peptide.",

Interestingly, substitution of the secondary MHC class II contact residue at p9 (N\u2192P) conferred an ability on the MHV peptide to induce stronger cross\u2010reactive PLP139\u2013151\u2010specific T cell responses, as measured by T cell proliferation or IFN\u2010\u03b3 ELISA assays. In contrast, substitution of P\u2192N at p9 of the HI mimic peptide (HI\u2013P) abrogated the ability of that peptide to induce cross\u2010activation of PLP139\u2013151\u2010specific T cells. In each case, mice made the most robust response to the immunizing peptide, as expected, but the gain or loss of proline at p9 either induced or negated the \u201cmimic potential\u201d of the peptide, respectively. Interestingly, mice immunized to MHV responded more strongly to recall with HI\u2013P than HI, probably as neither peptide contained P at p9. Conversely, only MHV+P and not MHV peptide recall challenge induced IFN\u2010\u03b3 production by T cells from HI574\u2013586\u2010immunized mice, likely due to the presence of P at p9 in both peptides.

As the mimic peptide\u2010specific T cells were shown to be competent IFN\u2010\u03b3 producers this suggests that they do not recognize or are not sufficiently reactivated in vivo in the CNS by endogenously presented PLP peptides and therefore do not induce clinical EAE 20.",

Previously, we demonstrated the importance of studying PLP\u2010mimic peptides in the context of a concomitant infection 12, 13. Here, we corroborate this hypothesis as infection of mice with TMEV engineered to express the 30\u2010mer MHV peptide induces a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by atypical clinical symptoms, similar in severity and time course to disease initiated with PLP\u2010 or HI\u2010expressing TMEV 12, 13, 21. In contrast MHV/CFA\u2010immunized mice do not develop disease. This is likely due to the fact that MHV30\u2010BeAn\u2010infected mice develop a robust IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010secreting PLP139\u2013151\u2010specific T cell population, unlike MHV/CFA\u2010immunized mice. It is likely that activation of peripheral and central immune cells by TMEV infection provides innate immune stimuli that can overcome the threshold for activation of PLP139\u2013151\u2010specific T cells by the MHV peptide. Interestingly, Th1 recall responses, particularly IFN\u2010\u03b3, to the self PLP139\u2013151 epitope were significantly higher in MHV30\u2010BeAn\u2010infected mice than were responses to the MHV mimic peptide itself. This likely reflects prolonged restimulation of high\u2010avidity PLP139\u2013151\u2010specific CD4+ T cells by self peptide endogenously released as a consequence of chronic myelin damage presented locally in the CNS by infiltrating dendritic cells 22, and the increased affinity of PLP139\u2013151 (IC50 87 nM) for I\u2010As compared to MHV3821\u20133832 (IC50 727 nM) 15.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that the MHV mimic peptide is a natural epitope for the SJL mouse as infection with MHV30\u2010BeAn encoding the MHV 30\u2010mer mimic sequence could be processed and presented by APC as measured by in vivo DTH responses.",
