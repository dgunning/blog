Neurologic illness onsets occurred during 8 August\u201315 September 2014. The median age of the children was 8 years (range = 1\u201318 years). Other than neck, back, or extremity pain in some patients, all had normal sensation. All had a preceding febrile illness, most with upper respiratory symptoms, occurring 3\u201316 days (median = 7 days) before onset of neurologic illness. Seven of 8 patients with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spinal cord had nonenhancing lesions of the gray matter of the spinal cord spanning multiple levels, and 7 of 9 with MRI of the brain had nonenhancing brainstem lesions (most commonly the dorsal pons). Two of 5 with MRI of the lumbosacral region had gadolinium enhancement of the ventral nerve roots of the cauda equina. Eight children were up to date on polio vaccination.",

There are 2 case reports in the literature of EV-D68 causing neurologic illness (acute flaccid paralysis and encephalomyelitis) as evidenced by detection of EV-D68 in the CSF. However, given the current suspected widespread circulation of EV-D68 respiratory infections in Colorado, and the antecedent respiratory illness in most of these children, the detection of EV-D68 in nonsterile upper respiratory tract specimens in those with neurologic illness might be coincidental. On 19 September, the CDPHE issued a Health Alert requesting reports of similar cases. One additional case with similar neurologic findings was reported as a result of this. On 26 September, CDC issued a national Health Advisory (available at: http://www.bt.cdc.gov/han/han00370.asp), which provides guidance for identifying and reporting cases. Clinicians should report to their local and state health departments patients aged \u226421 years with (1) acute onset of focal limb weakness occurring on or after 1 August 2014, and (2) MRI showing a spinal cord lesion largely restricted to gray matter.",
