The objective of this study was to provide the first investigation of a BCU's ability to contain aerosolized simulant fluorescent pathogen particles under different HVAC operating conditions.

For detailed explanation of the chamber setup used to conduct these measurements, see Ratnesar\u2010Shumate et al33 Briefly, the optical brightener/urea/water suspension was nebulized using a Sono\u2010Tek ultrasonic atomizer (nozzle power setting = 3 watts, liquid injection rate = 100 \u03bcL/min) (Sono\u2010Tek Corporation, Milton, NY, USA). The particles were allowed sufficient time to desiccate to a core particle size in aerosol capacitance chambers, well\u2010mixed using a high chamber flowrate (2500 L/min), and sampled isokinetically to measure particle size and number concentration using a UVAPS (Ultraviolet Aerodynamic Particle Sizer, Model 3314, TSI Inc., Shoreview, MN, USA). While a Sono\u2010Tek atomizer was used for chamber measurements, the Collison nebulizer was used during the JH\u2010BCU experiments due to its ease of transport and setup. Also, since the experimental repeats conducted in the JH\u2010BCU monitored particle dissemination for 20\u2010min post\u2010nebulization, chamber desiccation was used during the measurements of the suspension's particle number size distribution to mimic aerosol aging; thus, the nebulized particles were dried to a solid, core size to simulate droplet nuclei.34 Further, as described below in results, nebulization of the fluorescent suspension by the Collison nebulizer during experiments at the JH\u2010BCU was found to produce a particle number size distribution with 82.3% \u00b1 0.8% of the particles in the 0.5 to 1.7 \u03bcm size range. In comparison, the particle number size distribution produced by the Sono\u2010Tek atomizer resulted in 87.4% \u00b1 2.5% of particles in the 0.5 to 1.7 \u03bcm size range.

The IBAC samples ambient air at 3 L/min and provides the total number concentrations for fluorescent particles (particle number per liter of air, particles/L) every second. The IBAC utilizes ultraviolet laser induced fluorescence (UV\u2010LIF) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm to discriminate fluorescent particles from ambient background particles.35 The particles are binned into two size categories: 0.5\u20101.7 and 1.7\u201010 \u03bcm.36 The IBACs used in this study were within calibration, and particle concentration, particle sizing, and fluorescence were confirmed to be within tolerance prior to conducting testing using fluorescent polystyrene latex spheres of known size (2 \u03bcm, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).",

However, practical limitations during the design and building process should also be considered; the inlet and outlet vent locations in the JH\u2010BCU were selected in the patient room to be furthest from the doors and closest to the patient beds so that the net airflow of the patient room moves across the patient and then exits. It was also desired to locate the exhaust vents as far as practically possible from the donning and doffing room doors to remove particles away from these corridors to reduce the risk of particles entering into these spaces when the doors open.43 Furthermore, in the present experiments in the JH\u2010BCU under normal HVAC conditions, the exhaust vents appear to sufficiently remove released tracer particles.",

However, the donning space is also located on the opposite side of the room from where the tracer particles were released. On the other hand, the pressure differential between the patient room to the doffing space and the doffing space to the hallway corridor was close to zero (<\u22120.001 Pa to +0.05 Pa) (Figure 5). This suggests that the exhaust failure emergency protocol of increasing airflow to the areas adjacent to the patient rooms was not sufficient enough to create a negative pressure differential between the doffing room and patient room. It should be investigated if further increasing the airflow into the doffing space can reestablish the negative pressure differential between the doffing room and patient room. Also, since it is hypothesized that particles were transported out of the patient room through cracks in the doors, another recommendation to improve the airborne isolation capabilities of the patient rooms is to replace the hinged doors with sliding doors.43\n",

In this test, the following factors were similar between the HVAC exhaust failure condition with and without the ductless cooling/heating unit turned on: (a) average concentrations of fluorescent particles in the patient room and doffing room (Figure 7), (b) the net airflow in the patient room (~17 \u00b1 5 m3/h), and (c) the pressure differentials between the patient room and adjacent rooms (Figure 5). However, the time of appearance of fluorescent particles in the doffing room was different between the two exhaust failure conditions with and without the ductless cooling/heating unit on. By shutting off the ductless cooling/heating unit, the time required for particles to transport from the patient room to the doffing space was increased by approximately 3 min (Figure 7B). It is hypothesized that the airflow of the ductless cooling/heating unit helped push particles into the doffing room when the patient room lost negative pressure. The ductless cooling/heating unit in the patient room as depicted in Figure 6 faces the doffing room door. Therefore, assuming the ductless cooling/heating units are necessary for maintaining the comfort of the patient and HCWs upon failure of the BCU central HVAC system, future research should investigate different placement locations for the cooling/heating unit away from locations that will promote particle transport out of the patient room.",

During normal HVAC operation, there were no fluorescent tracer particles detected outside of the patient room suggesting that the locations of and ventilation rates used by the patient room exhaust vents were sufficient to contain particles in the patient isolation room. For these tests, no HCWs were present and no patient care activities were performed. During HVAC exhaust failure, fluorescent tracer particles were detected in the areas adjacent to the patient room, including the doffing room and the hallway; ~6% of the fluorescent particles detected in the patient room were transported into the doffing space by airflow alone and not by HCW movement or opening/closing of doors. Thus, the HVAC automated response during exhaust failure to increase airflow to spaces adjacent to the patient rooms is not sufficient for maintaining negative pressure differentials and complete airborne isolation conditions.

Additionally, the use of polydisperse, fluorescent tracer particles in combination with a networked array of real time, fluorescent aerosol sensors could be flexibly applied to other clinical spaces to investigate particle fate and transport throughout facilities. Because the fluorescent tracer particles used in this study (ie, optical brightener suspension) have been approved for release into public spaces,32 this type of research could be conducted in both empty and occupied spaces to investigate the influence of patient and healthcare provider movement on pathogen simulant transport.
