Participants were officially welcomed to Yokohama at the evening reception, where old friends and new were met over a smorgasbord of local cuisine. The main meeting was divided into sessions showcasing the wide-ranging research interests of IMGS members. These included human disease models and immunology, neuroscience, development and stem cells, genomics and computational analysis, epigenomics and noncoding RNAs, advances in genome editing, and large-scale resources. The Verne Chapman lecture was given by Professor John Mattick, Director of the Garvan Institute of Medical Research in Sydney, and the inaugural Darla Miller Distinguished Service Lectureship was awarded to Janan Eppig, Professor at The Jackson Laboratory and a pioneer of the mouse genome informatics (MGI) Program Project. Several poster sessions, a mentor lunch for trainees and workshops on bioinformatics, systems genetics, scientific literature curation, gene enrichment analysis, and FANTOM were also featured in the meeting program, which culminated in a feast of epic proportions. Abstracts from the meeting are available at www.imgc2015.jp.",

Fernando Pardo-Manuel de Villena (O-05; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill) demonstrated how his group has used CC mice with extreme phenotypes to generate new disease models for spontaneous colitis, drug-induced Parkinsonism and bronchiectasis. Many CC lines model aspects of disease that are not observed in standard mouse models, highlighting the importance of genetic diversity in experimental systems. This theme was echoed by Heike Kollmus (O-14; Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research), who demonstrated a variety of host responses to influenza A in the founder strains of the CC. Founders were categorized into highly resistant, intermediate, and highly susceptible, with a range of immune responses and global gene expression changes in the different strains. Clare Smith (O-15; UMASS Medical School) showed that resistance loci underlying tuberculosis pathogenesis could be mapped in ~60 CC lines and ~20 lines of the incipient C57BL/6 \u00d7 DBA/2 (BXD) cross. Interestingly, bacterial modules could be mapped onto the host genome to understand how both host and pathogen genomes determine disease outcome. The mapping resolution of the DO population was also highlighted in cancer, with Nigel Crawford (O-19; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) using quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in TRAMP \u00d7 J:DO F1 males to identify metastasis susceptibility loci for prostate cancer.",

Miyakawa\u2019s group drew the opposite conclusion from the data, demonstrating that responses in mouse models greatly mimic human inflammatory diseases (Takao and Miyakawa 2015). Alterations to the Seok et al. (2013) analysis included comparing genes that exist in both mouse and human, not just human disease genes that lack rodent homologs. He emphasized the need to define appropriate phenotypes and choose appropriate statistical methods. Ultimately, he concluded, the 15 % overlap in gene expression between mouse and human does not mean that the mouse is a bad model; instead, the overlapping 15 % probably contain the genes that are the most important for disease. The panel responses also emphasized other advantages of mouse models, including but not limited to access to tissue, ability to measure responses at different time-points on the same background and the capacity to do epigenetic studies.",

Future transcriptional profiling may uncover why the combination of X chromosome dosage and 2i culture conditions leads to attrition of female lines and will have important implications for those using mESCs. Sandra Richardson (O-07; University of Queensland) used retrotransposon capture sequencing (RC-seq) to deduce the timing and frequency of retrotransposon insertions in multigeneration C57BL/6 pedigrees. She presented data showing retrotransposition in the early embryo resulting in somatic and germline genetic mosaicism, adding to the evidence for retrotransposition as an important source of genetic diversity. Patrizia Rizzu (O-08; German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases) shared how she used FANTOM5 data to understand how a hexanucleotide repeat expansion influences the transcriptional profile of C9orf72, a gene involved in neurodegenerative disease. Yasuhide Furuta (O-09; RIKEN) derived compound mutant mice from mESCs containing multiple targeted mutations in the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling system to study the role of FGF family genes in eye development. Due to tight linkage between the genes of interest and reduced fertility in FGF mutant lines, it was previously impossible to generate compound mutants from an experimental cross.

Olfactory dysfunction is one of the earliest and most common symptoms of neurodegenerative disease in humans, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. Sanchez-Andrade\u2019s impressive analysis of the olfactory epithelium measured differential expression and protein dynamics in wild-type and transgenic mice to identify a set of candidate genes correlated with onset of FTDP.

His work showed that while the levels of many proteins are regulated by nearby variants that influence mRNA expression levels (cis-eQTL), the relative stoichiometry of proteins in stable partnerships and complexes is a key post-translational regulator of protein abundance that can act to buffer individual member proteins against cis-acting transcriptional variation. Robert Young (O-35; University of Edinburgh) presented evidence of divergence in the patterns of promoter gain and loss in humans and mice, offering insight into the evolutionary processes that contribute to gene expression and phenotypic diversity in both species. Peter Williamson (O-54; University of Sydney) used a panel of inbred mouse strains to identify QTL related to metabolism, body composition, lactation, and other complex traits.",

In addition to the several talks mentioned above, we heard from David Beier (O-32; Seattle Children\u2019s Research Institute) who analyzed the genomewide distribution of nonsense mutations in the exomes of individuals without severe Mendelian disorders. He found that the strength of heterozygote selection correlated with the likelihood of recessive lethality and that many genes with established roles in developmental diseases had high heterozygote selection. Martin Frith (O-51; National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tokyo) used sequence data from humans, chimps, orangutans, and dogs to classify different types of human chromosomal rearrangements, which occur in slowly evolving regions. Finally, Isaac Adeyemi Babarinde (O-37; National Institute of Genetics) introduced the audience to the capybara (the world\u2019s largest living rodent) and shared how he used its genome to understand the relationship between mutation rate and body size in rodents.",

She also showed that the expressed alleles of imprinted genes have greater chromatin contacts than the silent alleles, suggesting that these expressed regions are under greater organizational constraints. Reanalysis of the publicly available ENCODE data led Siddharth Sethi (O-27, MRC Harwell) to the discovery that transcription factor-binding sites are highly enriched in DNase1 hypersensitive sites compared to promoter and enhancer regions.

He presented data supporting enhancer transcription as the earliest event in successive waves of transcriptional change. This phenomenon was observed in multiple biological systems, suggesting this may be a general feature of mammalian transcriptional regulation, contrary to models showing coexpressions of enhancers and promoters. Albin Sandilan (O-43; University of Copenhagen) provided a clinical application, presenting RNA-seq data profiling colon specimens from patients with inflammatory bowel disease. A promoter set was identified, which could accurately distinguish between the primary disease subtypes: Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis.

This analysis revealed two classes of miRNA: cell-type-specific miRNAs and ubiquitous miRNAs. Cell-type-specific miRNAs are highly expressed in only a few cell types and may act as buffers of gene expression. Ubiquitous miRNAs are expressed in most cell types, but depleted in particular cell types and may be important in preventing inappropriate activation of transcriptional programs.",

Mattick is known for his research in revealing the central role of non-protein-coding DNA in the production of regulatory non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and his efforts to understand how ncRNA regulation contributes to the staggering level of phenotypic complexity observed throughout the animal kingdom. He began his lecture with the quote \u201cAre we letting a philosophy of the protein-coding gene control (our) reasoning? What then is the philosophy of the gene?\u201d He pointed out that this quote was not from this year or even this century\u2014it was in fact a concern attributed to Nobel laureate Barbara McClintock 75 years ago. He reminded us that the mammalian genome contains only ~20,000 protein-coding genes, the same number as in simple nematodes. On the other hand, the extent of non-protein-coding DNA increases with increasing developmental and cognitive complexity, reaching 98.5 % in humans. He guided us through the events leading up to his discovery and the explosion of studies that followed, peppering his tale with vivid descriptions of the findings and figures that have influenced him over the years. He shifted effortlessly between concrete descriptions of data and philosophical speculations on the evolution of paradigm shifts, the mysteries of biological complexity, and the silent assumptions that inform (and occasionally hinder) scientific practice. He entertained the audience with his encyclopedic knowledge of molecular genetics, framing his research within a larger historical context that served to complement data-driven descriptions of his and others\u2019 work establishing ncRNAs as prominent regulators of development, cognition, and disease in the mammalian genome. Mattick also elaborated on the relevance of ncRNAs to incipient areas of research and technology development in epigenomics and neurobiology, creating a memorable and thought-provoking experience for both experienced investigators and trainees (Fig. 3).\n",

It is remarkable that the field has gone from the invention of iPSC technology to the clinic in only 7 years. Dr. Takahashi presented the first human application of iPSC-derived targeting age-related macular degeneration, a retinal disease. She described an impressive panel of experimental validations for retinal pigment epithelial cell sheets derived from iPSCs, including whole genome, genotyping arrays, methylome, and single-cell analysis. Next, her group hopes not only to treat the retinal epithelium but also to use iPSCs to derive photoreceptors to completely restore vision in patients.
