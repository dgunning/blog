Ebola viruses were titrated by end-point titration in quadruplicate in Vero E6 cells cultured in DMEM supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum, 1 mmol/L L-glutamine, 50 U/mL penicillin and 50 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin. Cells were inoculated with 10-fold serial dilutions of virus and scored for cytopathic effect 14 days later. The median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) was calculated by the method of Spearman-Karber [15].",

The slope of the nonlinear regression of the nonnormalized data is \u22120.0029, and the slope of the nonlinear regression for the normalized model is \u22120.0016. Using the single-slope regression model generated for the data normalized to genome copy number, the time required for a reduction of 1 log TCID50 was calculated to be 619 minutes, or 0.43 days. This value is similar to the decay rate reported elsewhere for virus dried on stainless steel or plastic at 27\u00b0C (0.45 days for both substances) [23].
