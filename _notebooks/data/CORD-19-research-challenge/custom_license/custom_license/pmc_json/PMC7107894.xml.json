One quarter of the population is under 15 years old and the ethnic distribution within this age group is as follows: Melanesian (44.1%), European (27.8%), Polynesian (10.9%), people of mixed ethnicity (13.8%), Indonesian (0.6%) and other ethnic groups (2.8%). This multicultural population is mainly urban; 33.3% have a rural lifestyle and 2.1% live in tribal villages. New Caledonia has two marked seasons: a warm and wet season (December\u2013March) and a cooler one (June\u2013September). The population has excellent access to the health care system, which possesses European standards. However, medical consultation is sometimes delayed for people living in tribal villages and/or for those who use traditional medicine as the first point of care.",

However, we did not use PCR to detect classical bacteria, so the low bacterial detection could be the consequence of the use of less sensitive tests.

First, molecular tools enabled us to detect newer viruses including hMPV, hCoV and hBoV, which had been previously described in respiratory infections but never before identified in our setting. Second, RSV infections were clearly seasonal and peaked at the beginning of the cool season, likely promoted by community life (the beginning of the school year). Third, the seasonal distribution of influenza in children appeared to be concordant with previous findings in adults, in which the majority of cases occurred between June and September [4]. However, our ability to assess flu seasonality was limited because the total number of influenza cases observed during our study period was surprisingly small and all were associated with viral types B and C. None of these cases was accompanied by a pneumococcal superinfection, which differs from other descriptions [4, 20], but the absence of this infection may be due to our small numbers. This finding is important, as it emphasizes the value of long-term continuous surveillance to monitor trends in influenza and other respiratory viruses over time. Finally, hRhV was detected throughout the year and was as common in cases as in controls, calling into question its role as a LRI pathogen.",

However, nearly one third of the controls without respiratory infection had at least one virus present in their upper-respiratory airways, suggesting that the presence of a virus in NPS may not be sufficient to ascribe etiology. Even for RSV, the difference in viral prevalence between cases and controls was not statistically significant (P = .30), although the number of RSV detected was small. Seven viruses were found only in induced sputum, suggesting that induced sputum analysis could be of relevance for viral detection in some cases. Cultures of good-quality induced sputum yielded only 13 bacteria of 3 different species (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis); of note, all of these bacteria are also known to be involved in nasopharyngeal colonization in healthy children and in children with upper respiratory tract infection [22, 23], as confirmed in our study by bacterial colonization among 31.8% of the controls. The fact that 4 of the bacteria isolated from induced sputum were also cultured from the matched NPS indicates that we cannot exclude the possibility of contamination by upper respiratory secretions. Therefore, it would be interesting to determine if a pathogen isolated from a good-quality induced sputum sample is more likely to be responsible for the respiratory infection if absent from the NPS collected simultaneously. In order to progress in the interpretation of findings from paired samples of induced sputum and NPS, a comparison with a gold standard method (eg, transthoracic needle aspiration) is needed. Alternatively, assessing differences in the bacterial load at each site may help distinguish colonization from infection. Both approaches are planned in the PERCH study.",

In other settings with good primary care, high H. influenzae type b (Hib) and pneumococcal vaccine coverage and high access to antibiotics, most pediatric respiratory illness of bacterial origin will be prevented or treated in the outpatient setting and never require hospitalization. In a trial of Hib vaccine in Lombok, Indonesia, which used active surveillance to identify sick children at home and treat them in village clinics early in the course of illness, the vaccine showed no protective effect against hospitalized LRI, suggesting that the early treatment of Hib cases prevented the progression to severe disease [24]. Similar results were observed for protection against hospitalized LRI by pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in a trial among Native Americans (K. O\u2019Brien, personal communication). Together, these results indicate that viruses cause the majority of severe, hospitalized cases of LRI in locations with good access to outpatient antibiotic treatment and support the etiological findings from our study. Related to this point, our study also likely differs from the PERCH study because the majority of enrolled patients had a diagnosis of bronchiolitis, rather than severe pneumonia. The PERCH study will enroll hospitalized cases of severe and very severe pneumonia as defined by WHO. Because this definition is nonspecific, it will likely capture some cases of bronchiolitis as well as pneumonia. The PERCH study will attempt to exclude children with bronchiolitis by giving children a bronchodilator challenge [25]. Children with an indrawn lower chest wall that resolves with this therapy, regardless of its effect on wheeze, will be considered to likely have bronchiolitis, and will be excluded from the main PERCH study.",

Bacterial detection remained challenging and induced sputum analysis was hampered by difficulties in obtaining good quality specimens, which may have been a consequence of the collection method. Further studies are needed in order to properly distinguish between infection and colonization and will consist of comparing findings in NPS and induced sputum with other reference standards. This pilot study allowed us to improve the study design of the multi-site PERCH study in the following respects: (i) emphasizing the importance of good induced sputum collection technique using a method shown to yield high quality specimens [21, 27] (ii) highlighting potential barriers to control enrollment.",
