Further development of such a microbe with probiotic effects as a live vehicle carrying immunological molecules would provide the gastrointestinal tract with extra medical benefits. To implement this goal, L. reuteri, along with many other Lactobacillus species already applied in the probiotic field, has been intensively explored for its possible role as a vaccine carrier during the last decade.",

Given the considerable phylogenic distances existing among the more than 60 Lactobacillus reuteri species (Reveneau et al., 2002), which usually vary greatly in efficacy of transcription, translation and secretion signals (Grangette et al., 2002; Scheppler et al., 2002; Seegers, 2002), a broad host-spectrum ESV functional in many L. reuteri species seems unlikely to be developed in the near feature. Accordingly, an L. reuteri-specific nisin-inducible ESV, the pNIES, was constructed and found to possess advantages, including a high secretion efficiency, a high constitutive ES activity and also a satisfactory inducible capacity, appropriate for use in L. reuteri as a vaccine vector (Wu et al., 2006).",

Standard PCR was carried out with an automated thermal cycler (PerkinElmer).

First, its size (48 kDa), detected in the supernatant of the rL. reuteri culture (Fig. 3), when probed with the specific anti-GFP or anti-LTB antibodies, corresponded to the expected molecular mass of the mature GFP:STLTB protein. This indicated the fusion protein was not only expressed and secreted successfully, but also preserved its important GFP and LTB antigenic properties. Second, the appearance of fluorescence, though in yellow in color, signified a successful expression and folding of GFP in the two totally different environments of cell supernatant and cytoplasm. This kind of color change has been described in the Qbiogene manual as a normal result of the excitation-spectrum shift, caused by the interaction of two moieties in a fusion protein. Third, the receptor (gangliosides GM1 of the intestinal epithelial cell) binding ability, a property naturally possessed by the LTB and correlated with the mucosal immunogenicity and adjuvanticity of LTB when coadministered with other antigens (Guidry et al., 1997), was significantly detectable in our GFP:STLTB protein. This finding strongly qualified the fusion product as an excellent vaccine candidate. Finally, the fusion product, being >27 times greater in NOAEL (Table 2) than the purified ST, indicating that it was free from ST-associated toxicity. The exact reason for the lost of toxicity in our GFP:STLTB fusion is not clear. However, Clements (Clements, 1990) fused an LTB upstream to the ST, resulting in a fusion protein (i.e. LTB-ST) free of toxicity, and suggested the toxic determinant of ST had been masked by the upstream LTB moiety. Accordingly, the N-terminal GFP in our GFP:STLTB product may have the same masking effect on its downstream ST. Studies are required to address this suggestion more stringently.",

Generally, the fecal persistence time for a nonadhesive lactic acid bacteria was <24 h after an oral inoculation of 1 \u00d7 109 CFU (Oozeer et al., 2002). The extra 4 fecal persistence days of our rL. reuteri strongly indicated their capability of colonizing in the gastrointestinal tract. Accordingly, the gradational and extended secretion of rL. reuteri in feces (Fig. 6) might be attributed to the periodical sloughing of the adhered rL. reuteri from the mucosal membrane.",

It is therefore important to develop vaccines that can induce a mucosal immune response, mediated predominantly by the secretory IgA (sIgA), to neutralize the pathogens at the point where their initial infection and replication takes place. Furthermore, as many infections that have gained entrance through the mucosal surfaces will become systemic, the vaccines should also be able to elicit specific immunity in the systemic lymphoid tissues. In general, foreign antigens, delivered by the oral live vaccine carrier system, were able to elicit both specific sIgA and systemic serum IgG (Shaw et al., 2000; Grangette et al., 2002; Scheppler et al., 2002; Ho et al., 2005). Failures to induce antibody response, especially when using lactobacilli as a carrier, were mainly attributable to the low concentration of antigen expressed (Shaw et al., 2000; Seegers, 2002), although other factors, including bacteria strain, cellular location of antigen, immunization scheme and even mice breed, were also found to have certain impacts on it (Seegers, 2002).",

Notably, a rapid and substantially higher antibody response was seen in the latter group. To provide a possible reason for this observation, we inspected all in vitro analyses and were able to find two obvious differences existing between rL. reuteri 20016 and rL. reuteri 3-3: the plasmid stability of the vaccine vector pNIES-GFP:STLTB in rL. reuteri and the persistent CFU number of the rL. reuteri in the gastrointestinal tract. Apparently, these two differences eventually would lead to a higher level of the GFP:STLTB antigen being presented in the gastrointestinal tract by the rL. reuteri 3-3. This therefore confirmed the previous description that the level of the immune response is intimately associated with the level of the antigen expressed by an oral vaccine carrier (Seegers, 2002).",
