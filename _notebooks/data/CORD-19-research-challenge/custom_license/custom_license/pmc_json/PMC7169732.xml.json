The first is that certain pathogens might cause both. The second is transmission through hand contact with fomites. Both enteric and respiratory pathogens are often transmitted on surfaces of domestic and communal objects. Frequent contact between fomites, hands and faces is a likely transmission route. Handwashing (preferably with soap) can interrupt this transmission. The SARS outbreak has given this issue greater urgency. In a recent review of SARS prevention measures, Gamage et al. (2005) mentioned handwashing as a type of environmental decontamination. However, they located only the study by Seto et al. (2003) and not the others discussed below.",

It was a telephone survey of households of \u2018all probable SARS patients whose cases were reported to the Department of Health on or before May 16, 2003 (n = 1690)\u2019 (Lau et al. 2004c). Of the 1690 probable cases, 140 patients (8.2%) did not have a correct telephone number, 163 (9.6%) could not be contacted after at least five attempts, 163 (9.6%) refused to participate and 10 (0.6%) were either not in Hong Kong or could not communicate in English or Chinese. The remaining 1214 patients (72%) from 996 households were interviewed. Apart from 22 with incomplete questionnaires, the data for 1192 of these 1214 patients were analysed. A total of 727 patients fell into one or more of the following four categories: (1) probable cases of secondary or tertiary household transmission, (2) hospital workers, (3) residents in the Amoy Gardens or (4) inpatients who had been hospitalized for diseases other than SARS and kept on wards with SARS patients. Another 118 patients were in contact with a SARS patient within a 10\u2010day period before onset of fever. The source of infection of the remaining 347 (29.1% of 1192) was undefined. Excluding 17 patients who were below 16 years of age, 330 SARS patients aged 16 years or above became the cases of the case\u2013control study. Two controls per case, matched for age and sex, were drawn by a random telephone survey.",
