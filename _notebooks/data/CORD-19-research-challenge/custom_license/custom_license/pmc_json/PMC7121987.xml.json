            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a gammacoronavirus that is the aetiological agent of infectious bronchitis (IB); an acute and high contagious disease of poultry. Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses which replicate in the cell cytoplasm. Coronavirus genomes consist of single stranded positive sense RNA, and are the largest of all the RNA viruses ranging from approximately 27\u201332 kb; the genome of IBV is 27.6 kb. Molecular analysis of the role of individual genes in the pathogenesis of RNA viruses has been advanced by the availability of full-length cDNAs, for the generation of infectious RNA transcripts that can replicate and result in infectious viruses. The assembly of full-length coronavirus cDNAs was hampered due to regions from the replicase gene being unstable in bacteria. We therefore devised a reverse genetics strategy for IBV involving the insertion of a full-length cDNA copy of the IBV genome, under the control of a T7 RNA promoter, into the vaccinia virus genome in place of the thymidine kinase (TK) gene. This was followed by the in situ recovery of infectious IBV in cells both transfected with vaccinia virus DNA and infected with a recombinant fowlpox virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase [1].",

            "text": "One of the main advantages of using vaccinia virus as a vector for IBV cDNA is its ability to accept large quantities of foreign DNA without loss of integrity and stability [2]. A second and equally important advantage is the ability to modify the IBV cDNA within the vaccinia virus vector through transient dominant selection (TDS), a method taking advantage of recombinant events between homologous sequences [3, 4]. The TDS method relies on a three-step procedure. In the first step, the modified IBV cDNA is inserted into a plasmid containing a selective marker under the control of a vaccinia virus promoter. In our case we use a plasmid, pGPTNEB193 (Fig. 1; [5]), which contains a dominant selective marker gene, Escherichia coli guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Ecogpt; [6]), under the control of the vaccinia virus P7.5 K early/late promoter.\n",

            "text": "In the second step, this complete plasmid sequence is integrated into the IBV sequence within the vaccinia virus genome (Fig. 2). This occurs as a result of a single cross-over event involving homologous recombination between the IBV cDNA in the plasmid and the IBV cDNA sequence in the vaccinia virus genome. The resulting recombinant vaccinia viruses (rVV) are highly unstable due to the presence of duplicate sequences and are only maintained by the selective pressure of the Ecogpt gene, which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid (MPA) in the presence of xanthine and hypoxanthine [3]. In the third step, the MPA-resistant rVVs are grown in the absence of MPA selection, resulting in the loss of the Ecogpt gene due to a second single homologous recombination event between the duplicated sequences (Fig. 3). During this third step two recombination events can occur; one event will result in the generation of the original (unmodified) IBV sequence and the other in the generation of an IBV cDNA containing the desired modification (i.e., the modification within the plasmid sequence). In theory these two events will occur at equal frequency however in practice this is not necessarily the case.\n\n",

A paper towel should be put on the bottom of the boxes to absorb any possible spillages.During centrifugation of vaccinia virus infected cells use sealed buckets for the centrifugation to avoid possible spillages.After 2 h of incubation with the transfection mixture, the cells begin to die. It is best therefore not to exceed 90 min incubation.It is important that after the addition of each selection agent, the medium is mixed to ensure the selection agents are evenly distributed. This can be achieved by gently rocking/swirling the plate.Add an equal volume of 2 % agar to the 2\u00d7 EMEM containing MPA, xanthine and hypoxanthine and mix well before adding it to vaccinia virus infected cells. There is skill to making the overlay medium and adding it to the cells before the agar sets. There are a number of methods including adding hot agar to cold medium, or pre warming the medium to 37 \u00b0C and adding agar which has been incubated at 50 \u00b0C. Despite the method chosen it is important that all components of the overlay medium are mixed well, and the medium is not too hot when it is added to the cells. If there are problems, 1 % agar can be substituted with 1 % low melting agarose.The first recombinant event in the TDS system will not necessarily occur in the same place in every rVV. It is therefore important to pick a number of plaques from the first round of plaque purification in presence of GPT selection agents and take a variety of them forward. The following two rounds of plaque purification in the presence of GPT selection agents ensure a single virus population and also that no carry through of the input receiver/wild type vaccinia virus has occurred.Previous chapters and protocols have instructed during plaque purification in the absence of GPT selection agents to plate 10\u22121 rVV dilution in the presence of GPT selection medium and rVV dilutions 10\u22122 and 10\u22123 in the absence. When there are no plaques in the 10\u22121 dilution, it means that the rVV has lost the GPT gene and the plaques are ready to amplify and check for the presence of mutations.There are risks associated with working with phenol\u2013chloroform\u2013isoamyl alcohol and chloroform. It is important to check the local COSHH guidelines and code of practices.Vaccinia virus DNA is a very large molecule that is very easy to shear, therefore when working with the DNA be gentle and use wide bore tips or cut the ends off ordinary pipette tips. In addition always store vaccinia virus DNA at 4 \u00b0C; do not freeze as this leads to degradation. However, there is an exception to this if the vaccinia virus DNA has been extracted using the Qiagen QlAamp DNA mini kit, as this DNA will have already been sheared (the kit only purifies intact DNA fragments up to 50 bp). This DNA can be stored at \u221220 \u00b0C but it is only suitable for analysis of the rVV genome by PCR and is not suitable for the infection and transfection of CK cells for the recovery of rIBV.There is always the possibility that the recovered rIBV is not cytopathic. In this case, check for the presence of viral RNA by RT-PCR at passage 3 (P3). It is quite common even with a cytopathic rIBV not to see easily definable IBV induced CPE at P1 and P2. The recovery process is a low probability event and the serial passage of rIBVs in CK cells acts as an amplification step.\n",

In order to guarantee a single-step recombination event any potential recombinant vaccinia viruses are selected in the presence of MPA; only vaccinia viruses expressing the Ecogpt gene are selected. The main IBV genes are indicated, the replicase, spike (S), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) genes.

Integration of the complete pGPTNEB193 plasmid into the vaccinia virus genome results in an unstable intermediate because of the presence of tandem repeat sequences, in this example the 3\u2032 end of the replicase gene, the S gene and the 5\u2032 end of gene 3. The second single-step recombination event is induced in the absence of MPA; loss of selection allows the unstable intermediate to lose one of the tandem repeat sequences including the Ecogpt gene. The second step recombination event can result in either (I) the original sequence of the input vaccinia virus IBV cDNA sequence, in this case shown as a recombination event between the two copies of the 3\u2032 end of the replicase gene which results in loss of the modified S gene sequence along with Ecogpt gene; or (II) retention of the modified S gene sequence and loss of the original S gene sequence and Ecogpt gene as a result of a potential recombination event between the two copies of the 5\u2032 end of the S gene sequence. This event results in a modified S gene sequence within the IBV cDNA in a recombinant vaccinia virus",

The T7 RNA polymerase results in the synthesis of an infectious RNA from the vaccinia virus DNA that consequently leads to the generation of infectious IBV being released from the cell. (b) Any recovered rIBV present in the media of P0 CK cells is used to infect P1 CK cells. The media is filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcm filter to remove any FPV-T7 virus. IBV-induced CPE is normally observed in the P1 CK cells following a successful recovery experiment. Any rIBV is passaged a further two times, P2 and P3, in CK cells.

Vero cells are infected with rVV containing IBV cDNA and then transfected with a plasmid containing the IBV sequence to be inserted and the selective marker gene Ecogpt. Homologous recombination occurs and the complete plasmid sequence is inserted into the rVV. The Ecogpt gene allows positive selection of these rVV as it confers resistance to MPA in the presence of xanthine and hypoxanthine. The viruses are plaque purified three times in the presence of selection agents ensuring no wild type VV is present. The removal of the selection agents results in a second recombination event with the loss of the Ecogpt gene. Plaque purification in the absence of selection agents not only ensures the loss of the GPT gene but also ensures the maintenance of a single viral population. Small stocks of rVV are grown from individual plaques which are screened through PCR for the desired modification; this is found in theoretically 50 % of rVVs",
