Airborne spread of the virus also accounted for certain community outbreaks of SARS (Yu et al. 2004). Healthcare workers (HCW) were at the highest risk of having the disease, accounting for one fifth of the global total (World Health Organization 2003). In Hong Kong, 23% of the cases of SARS were healthcare workers. In Canada and Singapore, the proportions were higher (40% and 41%, respectively), as they had fewer SARS cases in the community than Hong Kong. Risk factors for infection in HCWs have been studied extensively, and a review on SARS infection and healthcare workers disclosed a number of risk and protective factors (Chan\u2010Yeung & Yu 2003; Lau et al. 2004). For example, lack of awareness and pre\u2010paredness when the disease first struck, poor institutional infection control measures, lack of training in infection control procedures, poor compliance with the use of personal protection equipment (PPE), exposure to high\u2010risk procedures such as intubation and nebulisation, and exposure to unsuspected SARS patients were associated with SARS infection. Measures to prevent nosocomial infection included establishing isolation wards for triage SARS patients; training and monitoring hospital staff in infection\u2010control procedures; active and passive screening of HCWs; enforcement of droplet and contact precautions; and compliance with the use of PPE.",

Several studies were conducted during the outbreak. One case control study was designed to understand how HCWs contracted the disease and how to prevent their infection (Ma et al. 2004). It was conducted shortly after the epidemic, but the data have never been prepared for an English language publication.

As a result, in the final model, cases were removed with missing values for selected variables only instead of missing values for all variables that were investigated. A stepwise\u2010forward (or backward) procedure has a disadvantage that it does not show in how far predictors are chosen at random. Thereafter we calculated all correlations between predictors and selected from the significant pairs the ones with one predictor in the final multivariate model and one not in the model. If swapping of the chosen predictor by its correlated counterpart does not seriously deteriorate the model, we conclude that we cannot tell whether one or the other predictor played a role.

Wearing gloves and multiple layers of protective gowns also each reduced the ORs of infection significantly (P = 0.011 and P = 0.052, respectively).

However, the risk of SARS infection, the level of precaution taken and the compliance with the standard largely depended on multiple factors, including the different time phases of patient contacts, different working areas and the various types of procedures performed. The outbreak in the hospital could be divided into two phases. In the early phase, there was a general lack of familiarity and training regarding infection\u2010control measures among hospital staff. Medical wards and equipment were not adequately set up for the strict infection control standard. While in the later phase, after a super spreading event (SSE) occurred in the hospital, HCWs became more vigilant about protecting themselves from SARS transmission, which together with adequate training and infection control measures led to significant differences in the infection rate between subjects from before and after 2 April 2003, when the institutional infection control measures were established and enforced. We defined two phases of contact with SARS using the date of 2 April as the divide. As found in univariate analysis, early contact with SARS patients increased the ORs of SARS infection significantly.

Certain types of procedures have been shown to be high\u2010risk because they can lead to extensive spreading of droplets from the patient, for example, the use of the jet nebulizer and intubation and assisted ventilation (CDC 2003a; Ofner et al. 2003; Fowler et al. 2004). Our study found a significant association of infection with performing chest compression; while performing intubation showed significant correlation with the former, we cannot distinguish between these two variables given multivariate logistic regression, so both might act as factors that enhance the probability of SARS infection. However, Lau et al. (2004) showed that performing particular high\u2010risk procedures on SARS patients was not considered to increase the disease risk.

The effectiveness of protective measures of using masks, gloves, gowns, and hand\u2010washing, recommended under \u2018droplet precautions\u2019 when caring for SARS patients, was also investigated for their protection effect. Some studies show that use of any mask was associated with lower ORs of infection in healthcare\u2010related clusters (Ruan et al. 2003; Seto et al. 2003; Nishiura et al. 2005). One study showed that consistent use of an N95 mask was more protective than not wearing a mask or consistent use of a surgical mask (Loeb et al. 2004). In our study, wearing a 16\u2010layer cotton surgical mask or 12\u2010layer surgical mask, as well as multiple layers of masks, reduced the risk of infection. However, this does not mean that the higher\u2010level protective masks, e.g. the N95 mask, cannot cause effective protection. The counting of N95 mask use was not large enough to give a significant P\u2010value. This might pose an important limitation leading to the failure to detect an effect, even though it may be there. The factor using more than one layer of masks was shown to be more protective than a single layer, which presents strong evidence that necessary and appropriate face protection should be advised to diminish the risk of droplet infection. The adoption of 16\u2010layer and 12\u2010layer cotton surgical masks individually was shown to be highly effective on risk reduction and therefore should be recommended accordingly.",

This, together with the significant results of wearing goggles as shown in univariate analysis, might confirm the crucial role of eye protection, although both factors were not confirmed in the subsequent multivariate analysis. These findings fit well with droplets transmission because droplets are generated at the face level, making the mask and eye protection necessary for protection.",

In the study by Seto et al. (2003) in Hong Kong, however, gowns were found to be protective, although protection from gloves also failed to achieve statistical significance. In our final multivariate model, we explicitly tested the hypothesis that inclusion of mask over gowns and gloves was due to change but were strengthened in confidence by the fact that exchange of one set of predictors for the other seriously distorted the model. So the failure of inclusion of gowns and gloves was due to their insufficient contribution to the multivariate logistic model. However, wearing of gloves or gowns should never be downplayed because of the insignificant P\u2010value in multivariate analysis. It should be noted that the effect of protective measures might be enhanced by beforehand training on infection control knowledge. In both univariate and multivariate analysis, the infection control training was significantly associated with lower risk of infection and also showed significant interaction with wearing multiple layers of masks. The latter finding had also been suggested in a previous study (Lau et al. 2004).",

During the early phase, HCWs in the hospital did not fully acknowledge the risk of the exposure to patients, and adequate personal protective equipments were not applied. The performance of endotracheal intubation and chest compression also helped to disseminate infected aerosol widely to a large number of patients and staff on the ward. This happened a lot during emergency care. During the latter phase, when the workers realised that they were dealing with a high risk infectious disease, they started to use personal protective equipment; however, due to general lack of familiarity and training regarding infection\u2010control measures among the working staff, the protective measures were not administered adequately while dealing with SARS patients. This might explain to some extent that even after protective measures were implemented, there remained hospital workers that contracted the infection.",

The same applies to taking training and contact data (after 2 April). Thus, we should be aware that these types of personal risk and protective activities definitely played role in the disease occurrence, although they could not be identified as such in the stepwise multivariate model. We also believe that, whereas this study accepted the current factors as significant using a P\u2010value < 0.05, other risk and protective factors for disease infection exist, which we failed to elucidate in this study.",

These results also provide confirmation that personal protective measures against droplet spread, such as wearing multiple layers of mask, are effective against the nosocomial spread of SARS. This knowledge may help prepare public health officials and clinicians for a reappearance of SARS, should it occur, or for the emergence of another comparable infectious disease. All HCWs should remain vigilant to evaluate and improve their infection\u2010control practices to limit possible future outbreaks of SARS and SARS\u2010like other nosocomial outbreaks). From the administrative point of the hospital, teaching and training of the medical profession in infectious diseases and the capacity of the public health sector to deal with these diseases must be strengthened.",
