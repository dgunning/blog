All samples were processed as 10% (vol/vol) suspensions with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 0.1 M, pH 7.2), and viral RNA was extracted from them. Subsequently, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed by using 3 primer pairs as described previously (4). To determine complete spike (S) gene sequence, we purified, cloned, and sequenced PCR products on an automated DNA sequencer by using T7, SP6 primers, and newly designed S gene\u2013specific primers (primer sequences available on request). Sequences were analyzed by ClustalX version 1.83 program (http://www.clustal.org) and MegAlign software (DNAStar Inc., Madison, WI, USA), and compared with those of reference strains in GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted with MEGA version 5.22 (5). The complete S gene sequence of the PEDV variant with a large genomic deletion (strain MF3809/2008/South Korea) described here has been deposited in GenBank under accession no. KF779469.",

Exact length of the band was 981 nt, and the band was much shorter than that of intact fragment because of 612-nt deletion at positions 22777\u201323388 (1,593 vs 981 nt for PEDV reference strains and PEDV variant, respectively; Technical Appendix Figure 1). Sequence similarity of the 981-nt fragment of MF3809 was found to be in PEDV S gene region in GenBank by BLAST analysis (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). The complete S gene (3549-nt segment, corresponding to 1182 aa) of MF3809 had high (93.3%\u201398.5% nt, 92.0%\u201398.0% aa) sequence identity to all known PEDV strains for which full-length S gene sequences were available in GenBank, except that MF3809 has the large deletion in its S gene. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that MF3809 belonged to a cluster containing a PEDV reference strain, not a cluster that included any other coronaviruses, and showed the closest genetic relationship with PEDV strains from South Korea in 2009 (Figure).",

The cells and supernatants of the 3 passages were positive for the virus, and the control inoculated with PBS was negative; however, the amount of viral RNA in the medium decreased with each passage. Whether the positive result was attributed to residual viruses of the initial inoculation or to the decreased propagation of the virus in the cells is not clear. Further studies, such as continuous serial passages and neutralization assays, are needed to determine the final activity of the virus in Vero cells.",

            "text": "Our large-scale study of the incidence of PEDV in pigs with diarrhea in South Korea found that 7.8% of animals were infected with the virus. Moreover, our investigation identified and characterized a new PEDV variant with a 612-nt deletion in S gene, corresponding to a 204-aa deletion. The coronavirus S protein plays a pivotal role in regulating interactions with specific host cell receptor glycoproteins to mediate viral entry and stimulate induction of neutralizing antibodies in the natural host (1,2,9). Mutations or deletions in the coronavirus S gene affect its pathogenicity and tissue tropism (10\u201312). Porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), a naturally occurring deletion mutant of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), is an example of pathogenic change and tropism switching, apparently associated with S gene change. PRCV has a 224-aa deletion at positions 21\u2013244 in the N terminal region, which is needed for the enteric tropism of TGEV and comprises antigenic sites C and B (13\u201315), of S1 compared with TGEV. In other words, TGEV, a highly enteropathogenic porcine coronavirus, is turned into PRCV, a respiratory pathogen with reduced pathogenicity, as a consequence of a large deletion in the S gene. Unlike PRCV, the PEDV variant has a 204-aa deletion at positions 713\u2013916 in the C-terminus of S1 and N terminus of S2, destroying 4 N-linked glycosylation sites at positions 728, 745, 783, and 875, as well as 2 neutralizing epitopes, SS2 (753\u2013760) and SS6 (769\u2013776) (Technical Appendix Figure 2). These amino acid mutations might cause the conformational change of S protein and result in antigenicity/immunogenicity alteration of the PEDV variant. However, how the PEDV variant was generated and has evolved is not clear. Further studies should be conducted to analyze extensive genomic sequences and determine biological properties, such as pathogenicity, tissue tropism, and transmissibility of the new PEDV variant.",
