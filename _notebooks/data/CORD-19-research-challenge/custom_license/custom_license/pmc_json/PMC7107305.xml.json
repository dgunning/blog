            "text": "Both the complexity and diversity of the PPR and the macro domain were higher in viral population of the patients whose infection became chronic than in those who cleared the virus. It has been shown that the quasispecies heterogeneity in the ORF2 region encoding the capsid protein during the acute phase of infection is associated with the development of a chronic HEV infection [12]. Our data support the finding that great genetic heterogeneity of the quasispecies in patients whose infection become chronic seems to favor the appearance of variants that can persist, as reported for HCV infections [13]. Although the diversity of the region preceding the PPR was higher in patients with chronic infection, nt and aa complexities were not different in the 2 groups (data not shown), suggesting that the higher heterogeneity in chronic patients was not a general effect seen across the entire region studied. This great genetic heterogeneity could also reflect an inadequate control of the viral replication, but no correlation was found between quasispecies heterogeneity and viral concentrations. PPR appears to be dispensable for in vitro HEV replication, but it is required for in vivo infection, suggesting that it is involved in infecting cells with innate immunity [4]. Although the role of the macro domain in the replication of HEV is unknown, it does not seem to be essential for the replication of coronavirus in cell culture [14]. It was recently suggested that genes that are dispensable for virus replication are involved in modulating the host immune response, like down-regulating interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) or tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF- \u03b1) secretion [5]. The macro domain is also involved in the inflammation caused by the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and the substitution of a strictly conserved amino-acid residue is responsible for reducing the secretion of inflammatory cytokines [6]. The great quasispecies heterogeneity in patients whose infection became chronic may include some variants that reduce inflammatory cytokine production, which could facilitate HEV persistence. This could explain the lower serum concentrations of interleukin 1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist and TNF-\u03b1 found in patients whose infection became chronic [12].",
