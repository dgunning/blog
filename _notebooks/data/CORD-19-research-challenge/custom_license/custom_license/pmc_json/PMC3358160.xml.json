The amplified products were analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Sanger sequencing was conducted by using an ABI Prism 3130XL DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and an ABI Prism Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit, version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems). Sequence alignment by using Simmonic and phylogenetic analysis of the partial sequences of segments S1 (1,501 nt), S2 (1,213 nt), S3 (1,078 nt), and S4 (1,113 nt) was performed by using MEGA4 software (www.megasoftware.net) with the neighbor-joining method.

The role of bats as reservoirs and sources of potential emerging viral infections has been extensively studied with regard to Nipah, Hendra, lyssavirus, and coronaviruses (6,7,10). Although we were unable to demonstrate rises in antibody titers because of a lack of paired acute-phase and convalescent-phase serum samples, we believe that the isolation of fusogenic orthoreoviruses, the presence of antibody to the viruses, and epidemiologic information suggest that orthoreoviruses were possibly associated with the patients\u2019 upper respiratory tract infections.",

Also, similar to the 7-day incubation period of the patient infected with Melaka virus, incubation periods for the patients reported here ranged from 4 to 7 days. The cross-reactivity of the 3 virus strains, demonstrated by PRNT, suggests that they were antigenically similar. Neutralizing antibodies appeared within 8 days of disease onset, and titers were still high at 2 months. Although all persons who had been in contact with the patients during their travel and at home were asymptomatic, no serum was available for further workup to determine subclinical infection or human-to-human transmission. Nevertheless, subclinical infection and transmission among close contacts have been demonstrated (3,4).",

Although the S2 major inner capsid proteins and S4 major outer capsid proteins of all 3 viruses were clustered together, they differed in the S1 virus cell attachment protein and S3 nonstructural protein. The S1 segments of HK46886/09 and HK50842/10 viruses were clustered together with the Miyazaki virus and related to the Kampar virus, but that of the HK23629/07 virus was similar to but distinct from the Melaka virus. The S3 segments of HK46886/09 and HK50842/10 viruses were clustered together and similar to those of the Kampar and Paula viruses, whereas the HK23629/07 virus shared similar homology with the Miyazaki virus. The difference in clustering based on the S1\u2013S4 segments alone provides evidence for virus reassortment.",

Isolation of closely related orthoreoviruses within a short time in the region illustrates the genetic diversity of the virus and that reassortment events are not uncommon. The association of orthoreovirus infection with bat exposure showed that these abundant mammals are natural reservoirs and play a contributing role in virus evolution. In addition, the segmented nature of the virus genome also facilitates virus reassortment, which leads to virus diversity.",

Infections occurred in humans when the pathogens crossed the species barrier to expand their host range. Changes in human activities also bring humans in close contact with animals (6,8,13\u201315). Epidemiologic and molecular studies provide evidence that the pathogens isolated from humans shared a high degree of homology with viruses isolated from their animal reservoirs (8,15). The ability of a pathogen to emerge and cause outbreaks depends on the efficiency of its human-to-human spread. Recombination and reassortment events facilitate virus adaptation in the new host. Further study is warranted to unravel the possible virus spillover and adaptation of orthoreoviruses as a cause of human infection.",
