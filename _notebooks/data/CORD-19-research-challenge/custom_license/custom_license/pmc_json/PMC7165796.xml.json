            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is ubiquitous in swine\u2010producing areas of the world. Virus transmission readily occurs by the respiratory route, and multiplication in the respiratory tract is followed by viraemia and replication in several organs. The virus has a predilection for pulmonary alveolar macrophages (AMs) and the lungs are a major target organ (Duan et al., 1997; Labarque et al., 2000). Experimental infections with European PRRSV isolates consistently result in microscopic lesions of interstitial pneumonia (Paton et al., 1992; Plana et al., 1992; Halbur et al., 1995; Van Reeth et al., 1999), but overt respiratory signs are more difficult to produce. In most experimental studies, the infection is largely asymptomatic and a transient fever is the most prominent clinical change (Paton et al., 1992; Plana et al., 1992; Albina et al., 1994; Van Reeth et al., 1999). Furthermore, in the field, many PRRSV infections are subclinical, particularly if uncomplicated.",

            "text": "However, it cannot be denied that there has been a general increase in respiratory disease and poor productivity since PRRSV has become enzootic. Respiratory infections which have been very common for many years seem to have increased in severity since the appearance of PRRSV. In problem herds, PRRSV has been demonstrated together with various bacteria and with porcine respiratory coronavirus and swine influenza virus (Keffaber et al., 1992; Morrison et al., 1992; Halbur et al., 1993; Kamogawa et al., 1996). Combined infections with PRRSV and other agents may therefore play an important part in respiratory disease problems. It has previously shown that experimental dual infections with PRRSV followed by H1N1 influenza virus can result in enhanced fever, respiratory disease and growth retardation in comparison with the respective single virus infections (Van Reeth et al., 1996). In these earlier studies, conventional PRRSV\u2010seronegative pigs were used and a fixed 3\u2010day time interval between PRRSV and influenza virus inoculations. Yet, PRRSV replicates in the lungs during 1 month and longer (Duan et al., 1997; Labarque et al., 2000), and there is thus a much longer time period for a second infection to occur in the PRRSV\u2010infected pig. Under field conditions, secondary infections may occur with an interval of a few days or several weeks, and the exact timing and chronology of infections will differ from case to case. The present experiments compare PRRSV\u2010H1N1 inoculations at 3\u2010, 7\u2010 and 14\u2010day intervals in conventional pigs. Next to clinical evaluations, this study includes bacteriologic examinations of the lungs of selected pigs. In addition, the clinical effects of the PRRSV\u20107 day\u2010H1N1 inoculation were studied for the first time in caesarean\u2010derived colostrum\u2010deprived (CDCD) pigs.",

As such, a first experiment with conventional feeder pigs aimed at comparing PRRSV\u2010H1N1 infections at 3\u2010, 7\u2010 and 14\u2010day intervals. A second conventional pig experiment was designed to confirm the clinical effects of the PRRSV\u20103d\u2010H1N1 and PRRSV\u20107d\u2010H1N1 inoculations and, in addition, to judge on the possible contribution of bacterial or mycoplasmal infections.

The reasons for the limited duration of the interaction between PRRSV and influenza virus are unknown. PRRSV replicates in the lungs during at least 4\u20136 weeks, and microscopic lung changes have been reported to persist until 28 days after experimental infection (Halbur et al., 1995). However, PRRSV specific immunity starts to develop and virus titres gradually decrease from 14 days post\u2010inoculation onwards (Nelson et al., 1994; Labarque et al., 2000). Although knowledge of the cytokine profile during PRRSV infection remains incomplete, cytokines such as IL\u20104, IL\u201010 and transforming growth factor\u2010\u03b2 have been demonstrated in the lungs during the subacute stages of infection with influenza virus and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (Hennet et al., 1992; McInnes et al., 1998). These \u2018late\u2019 cytokines are known to limit the (pro)inflammatory actions of the early cytokines produced during the acute stage. It has therefore been postulated that a secondary infection occurring during this period will cause few pathological and clinical effects (Bielefeldt\u2010Ohmann, 1995). It is thus an attractive hypothesis that the mild clinical course of the PRRSV\u201014d\u2010H1N1 infection relates to the production of down\u2010regulatory cytokines.",

            "text": "Conventional pigs, even if clinically healthy, may carry a variety of bacteria in the upper respiratory tract and colonization of the lungs may follow after (experimental) virus infection and thereby enhance disease. Streptococcus suis was isolated from the lungs of one of two PRRSV\u2010H1N1 infected pigs in the second conventional pig experiment. The role of this streptococcal infection in the extensive lung pathology and disease seen here is uncertain. On the one hand, the fact that just a few bacterial colonies were isolated from only one of four lung lobes minimizes their clinical significance. On the other hand, S. suis has been associated with disease and bronchopneumonia, particularly in pigs with concomitant virus infections of the lungs. Galina et al. (1994) have demonstrated that PRRSV can predispose pigs to infection and disease caused by S. suis. Furthermore, it is remarkable that a variety of bacteria \u2013Haemophilus parasuis, Actinobacillus suis and Bordetella bronchiseptica\u2013 have also been isolated from pneumonic lung tissue of pigs during experimental infections with PRRSV and M. hyopneumoniae (Thacker et al., 2000). Thus, although conventional pig experiments have the advantage of mimicking the field situation closely, it is assumed that bacterial infections often contribute to the clinical picture in such experiments and that PRRSV perhaps predisposes to bacterial colonization of the lungs.",

For unknown reasons, only one out of five pigs showed severe clinical signs upon the dual virus inoculation. Although PRRSV is recognized as one of the most important aetiologic agents in multi\u2010infectious respiratory disease of pigs, it has proved to be extremely difficult to reproduce such disease syndrome experimentally. Dual infections with PRRSV followed by Salmonella choleraesuis, Pasteurella multocida or Haemophilus parasuis were all very mild or subclinical (Cooper et al., 1995; Carvalho et al., 1997; Solano et al., 1997). The combination of PRRSV with either influenza virus, M hyopneumoniae or S suis produced disease in experiments by some researchers (Galina et al., 1994; Van Reeth et al., 1996; Thacker et al., 1999), but remained subclinical in the hands of others (Albina et al., 1995; Cooper et al., 1995; Van Alstine et al., 1996; Pol et al., 1997). The present study supports the suggestions that differences in the time interval between infections or in the sanitary status of pigs can be in part responsible for these discrepancies. However, a large variation in clinical disease between individual pigs is a hallmark of the PRRSV\u2010influenza virus infection, irrespective of the time interval between infections or the sanitary status of pigs. Finally, the important question as to which factors determine the clinical outcome of a PRRSV infection remains unanswered. Further experimental studies will be carried out to find out why severe disease develops in some PRRSV\u2010H1N1 infected pigs and not in others.",
