Other outbreaks have occurred, including a large one in the United States in 2003, in which 47 confirmed and probable human cases of MPXV infection were identified after importation of wild rodents from Ghana (3). Phylogenetic analyses of MPXVs have revealed 2 distinct clades, West African and Congo Basin (4). In the past decade, human MPXV infections also have increased in Central and West Africa (5).",

In addition, a 6-nucleotide deletion (GTATAC, a repeat unit) was more evident in the dUTPase region of Sierra Leone 2017 compared with other MPXVs from Africa. Also, a 25-nucleotide insertion (5\u00d7 repeat of TCCAT unit) in the kelch-like protein-encoding region was more evident in the USA_2003_039 genome compared with most MPXV isolates from Africa.

Considering the patient\u2019s history of hunting and eating squirrels, and the lack of new cases among 16 identified community contacts in Pujehun, we hypothesize that the patient was likely infected by contact with wild animals. Of note, MPXV genetic evidence from this case-patient was closely related to UTC_1964, a strain that was isolated from an animal imported from Africa to the Rotterdam Zoo in 1966 (10). Because the reservoir species of MPXV remains unknown, we hypothesize that our case-patient was probably infected by exposure to wild animals and not from MPXV imported to Sierra Leone from Central Africa. However, further serologic surveys of animals in this region could provide useful evidence for the origin of MPXV strain Sierra Leone 2017.",
