We investigated the localized immune response following infection with hRSV or A(H1N1)pdm09. Nasal wash specimens were collected early (day 2) and later (day 6/7) after infection, because the pattern of inflammatory mediators changes throughout H(H1N1)pdm09 [30] and hRSV [24] infections. Expression of influenza virus matrix (M) mRNA was highest on day 2 after infection, whereas expression of hRSV nucleoprotein (N) mRNA was highest on day 6 (Figure 5A). Two days after infection, animals infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 had significantly higher levels of interferon \u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2), granzyme B, IFN-\u03b3, interleukin 6 (IL-6), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) mRNA as compared to animals infected with hRSV (Figure 5D, 5G\u2013I, 5N, and 5O). Expression of IFN-\u03b1 and granzyme A mRNA was increased but not significantly (IFN-\u03b1, P = .097; granzyme A, P = .18; Figure 5E and 5F). On day 6/7 after infection, levels of granzyme A, granzyme B, IFN-\u03b3, interleukin 17, and MCP-1 mRNA were significantly higher in animals infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 as compared to those infected with hRSV (Figure 5F\u2013H, 5M, and 5N). There was significant increase in expression of interleukin 8 (IL-8) mRNA 2 days after infection and of interleukin 1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8 mRNAs 6/7 days after infection in ferrets infected with hRSV as compared to A(H1N1)pdm09 (Figure 5C, 5I, and 5J).

Whereas retropharyngeal lymph node cells from A(H1N1)pdm09-infected ferrets were restimulated with A(H1N1)pdm09 (Figure 6B), few cells produced IFN-\u03b3 when stimulated with hRSV (Figure 6A).

Responses to concanavalin A were similar for all ferrets regardless of infection (Figure 6B). Moreover, there was limited serological cross-reactivity. Animals infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 had high levels of influenza virus\u2013specific neutralizing antibodies (Figure 6C), yet minimal total serum or neutralizing antibodies to hRSV (Figure 6D and 6E).

Infection with hRSV did not prevent subsequent infection with A(H1N1)pdm09; rather, animals were coinfected, albeit with reduced morbidity. Infection with A(H1N1)pdm09 leads to increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the respiratory tract as compared to infection with hRSV.

MCP-1 and TNF-\u03b1 regulate the migration of macrophages/monocytes and natural killer (NK) cells into the respiratory tract. Macrophages produce MCP-1, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6; thus, upregulation of these genes suggests an influx of macrophages and NK cells into the respiratory tissues [34]. NK cells produce IFN-\u03b3, which activates macrophages and neutrophils and promotes T-cell proliferation and killing of virus-infected cells [34]. Because cytotoxic T lymphocytes and NK cells also produce granzymes A/B, increased expression of IFN-\u03b3 and granzyme A/B mRNAs on day 6 after infection suggests recruitment/activation of these cells to the site of infection. IL-6 and type I IFNs are produced by respiratory epithelial cells, monocytes/macrophages, and dendritic cells [34, 35]. IL-6 is a proinflammatory cytokine, whereas type I IFNs induce an antiviral state that may also limit replication and spread of hRSV [34, 35] It would be useful to explore the cellular infiltrate following A(H1N1)pdm09 and hRSV infections to gain further insight into potential differences in the level and cellular composition present in local inflammation. Infection with A(H1N1)pdm09 induced a 7-fold higher cellular IFN-\u03b3 recall response as compared to infection with hRSV in our study. Because there was no significant difference in IFN-\u03b3 responses to concanavalin A between the groups, this observation was not due to a difference in overall T-cell numbers but, instead, was due to an increase in the reactivation of A(H1N1)pdm09-specific cells. Taken together, these data suggest that infection with A(H1N1)pdm09 induces a robust cytokine and chemokine response that strongly stimulates the adaptive and memory immune responses. Conversely, infection with hRSV elicited a weaker and more limited cytokine and chemokine response that led to a reduced antigen-specific cellular response. However, it is possible that hRSV may not infect the ferret respiratory tract as efficiently as A(H1N1)pdm09 does, and this could result in reduced inflammatory responses. Yet, infected animals seroconverted at titers consistent for sterilizing immunity, indicating a productive infection (data not shown) [24]. Furthermore, increasing the inoculum of hRSV did not significantly affect the pattern or amount of virus shedding nor the expression of inflammatory mediators, suggesting that the hRSV level was already maximal in this ferret model. Notably, increased expression of inflammatory mediators following infection with influenza virus as compared to hRSV has been observed in studies assessing human clinical samples and in vitro airway epithelial cell cultures [36\u201339].",

The increased antiviral state and inflammation observed after A(H1N1)pdm09 infection has the potential to prevent subsequent infection or delay shedding of hRSV, as was observed here. Both viruses predominantly infect ciliated airway epithelial cells, and we have shown that A(H1N1)pdm09 and hRSV Long replicated in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of ferrets [24, 30]. Infection with A(H1N1)pdm09 can also prevent infection with an influenza B/Yamagata virus [10]. There are minimal shared epitopes between influenza A and B viruses [40], and we showed that minimal cross-reactive IFN-\u03b3\u2013producing cells were induced between hRSV and influenza virus. These data suggest that short-lived mechanisms drive this effect, as no effect was detected in ferrets after one week or, as shown by others, in mice, when infections were separated by 35 days [41]. The timing of interference indicate that interactions between different viruses may also be important. It is possible that different mechanisms act on different virus combinations. Gene expression analysis of early markers of the immune response of respiratory epithelium infected with the virus strains used in these studies may provide further insight.",

Although virus loads were not decreased in nasal wash specimens, virus shedding may be reduced in the lower respiratory tract, limiting clinical disease. IL-8 mRNA expression was elevated in nasal wash samples of ferrets infected with hRSV as compared to A(H1N1)pdm09. Increased IL-8 expression has been associated with milder disease in ferrets infected with pathogenic influenza virus strains, potentially mediated by rapid recruitment of neutrophils, which assist in clearing virus [42]. Analysis of the lung influenza virus loads in animals that have been infected with hRSV prior to challenge with A(H1N1)pdm09 would be of interest.",

Similarly, a delay of 2-4 weeks of the expected peak of hRSV was reported following an early influenza A season in the Netherlands. [3]. These population-level observations of viral interference arise from the interplay between (1) immunodynamics (ie, host-level viral interference), (2) heterogeneity between hosts (ie, differences in immunity to virus strains between individuals), and (3) transmission dynamics (ie, within or between different age groups) [43]. For influenza, these processes have been investigated in some detail. Others have demonstrated that a short period (ie, days rather than weeks) of viral interference at the host level may result in substantial separation between epidemic waves at the population level [43]. Our results provide the first host-level immunodynamic evidence in support of these processes driving the epidemiological interactions observed previously in Europe [1, 2].",
