Since then, hMPV has been identified frequently in respiratory tract infections worldwide [Kahn, 2006], and lately recognized as a major cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants, elderly, and immunocompromised patients [Bao et al., 2008]. Around 12% of all respiratory tract infections in children are caused by hMPV [Kahn, 2006], and almost all children are infected by the age of 5 [Van den Hoogen et al., 2001]. Human metapneumovirus also accounts for 10% of all hospitalizations of elderly patients with respiratory tract infections [Falsey et al., 2003], and is a significant pathogen in immunocompromised patients [Muir and Pillay, 1998; Williams et al., 2005].",

Human metapneumovirus can cause both upper and lower respiratory tract infections, such as bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia [Boivin et al., 2002], as well as asthma exacerbation [Kahn, 2003]. Symptoms such as fever, cough, tachypnea, wheezing, and hypoxia are frequently observed in infected children, and in children with a clinical syndrome consistent with bronchiolitis, hyperinflation, as well as focal infiltrates and peribronchial cuffing [Williams et al., 2004]. Some reports have shown that hMPV infection is associated with encephalitis, and there is at least one example where hMPV was detected in a patient who died of complications associated with encephalitis [Schildgen et al., 2005]. In addition, some studies have reported a hospital\u2010acquired hMPV infection in infants, children, and elderly patients in long\u2010term care facilities [Chano et al., 2005; Honda et al., 2006; Boivin et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2009].",

Subsequent genetic analysis led to a further subdivision of the hMPV A and B subgroups into the subtypes 1A, 2A, 1B, and 2B [Biacchesi et al., 2003]. Moreover, subgroup A2 was further subdivided into two minor subgroups A2a and A2b [Huck et al., 2006]. Although viral respiratory tract infections are very common in Kuwait and responsible of acute respiratory diseases and pneumonia [Hijazi et al., 1996, 1997], the prevalence of hMPV infection is not yet documented in Kuwait. The aims of this study were therefore to determine the prevalence of hMPV infection in Kuwait in patients with respiratory tract infections with respect to the other respiratory viruses, to identify the type of circulating hMPV, and to determine the seasonal distribution of hMPV infection.",

Previous studies on hMPV infection have been published in the Middle East area however, most of them have focused on one age group, children less than 5 years [Al\u2010Sonboli et al., 2005; Regev et al., 2006; Arabpour et al., 2008; Kaplan et al., 2008; Ali et al., 2010; Moattari et al., 2010]. Not surprising, most of respiratory samples collected in this study were from infants less than 2 years, showing that the most affected age group vulnerable for respiratory infections is infants. Infants are considered to be at high risk for respiratory infections, since their immunity system is being progressively developed during their first 2 years [File, 2000]. Respiratory infections are considered as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries [Campbell, 1995], and this agrees with our observation that most of the respiratory samples (65%) were collected from patients admitted to the intensive care unit for acute lower respiratory tract infections.",

These results are in agreement with a previous study done in Kuwait showing that respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinovirus were the major cause of severe lower respiratory tract infections in Kuwait [Khadadah et al., 2010]. In addition, the best respiratory samples for hMPV detection were endotracheal tube secretions, tracheal aspirate, nasopharyngeal aspirate followed by nasopharyngeal swab, whereas hMPV RNA was not detected in throat swab, nasal swab, bronchoalveolar lavage and pleural fluid. This support earlier studies which recommended nasopharyngeal aspirate and swabs specimens for hMPV detection [Van den Hoogen et al., 2001, 2004a]. The prevalence of hMPV infection among the study population was 5.4%. Previous studies have reported that it accounts for at least 5 to 7% of the respiratory tract infections in hospitalized children, and at least 3% in the general community of patients who visit a general practitioner for respiratory tract infections [Van den Hoogen et al., 2004b].",

In Qatar the hMPV virus was the most commonly detected virus, accounting for 74% of all respiratory infections among pediatric patients aged 1 month to 5 years, and this result is very similar to the current study finding that most of hMPV\u2010positive patients were of age 2 years and less than 76% [Al\u2010Thani et al., 2010]. Our results highlight the importance to introduce a screening test for hMPV infection in routine diagnosis, and to have appropriate medical management for hMPV\u2010positive cases as other studies have recommended previously [Deffrasnes et al., 2007]. Moreover, the clinical data of hMPV\u2010positive patients have shown that all elderly people presented with pneumonia mainly, while infants presented with a variety of clinical syndromes such as bronchopneumonia, pneumonia, acute exacerbation of bronchial asthma and bronchiolitis, a finding which has also been observed in previous studies [Boivin et al., 2002; Williams et al., 2004].

Some previous reports have shown a co\u2010infection of hMPV/respiratory syncytial virus, which correlated with the severity of infection [Greensill et al., 2003; Semple et al., 2005]. On the other hand, other studies have shown that hMPV/respiratory syncytial virus co\u2010infection may normally be rare in most populations [Mackay et al., 2006], while some publications have failed to detect this co\u2010infection [Esper et al., 2003; Al\u2010Sonboli et al., 2006; Van Woensel et al., 2006]. Furthermore, some recent studies have found co\u2010infection of hMPV with SARS\u2010coronavirus and human bocavirus [Choi et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2007]. The co\u2010infection of hMPV/rhinovirus might be responsible for the severe symptoms presented by our patients. Indeed, one 2\u2010years\u2010old female had high hMPV RNA load (4.62 \u00d7 108 copies/ml) and presented with acute exacerbation of bronchial asthma. A male infant aged 2 months had recurrent chest infection with frequent intensive care unit admission, and his hMPV viral load was high (1.76 \u00d7 106 copies/ml). The last patient was a 1\u2010year\u2010old female with recurrent chest infection and frequent intensive care unit admission, and her hMPV RNA load was high (5.73 \u00d7 108 copies/ml). This suggests that the presence of hMPV infection with other respiratory virus may complicate the clinical condition and prolong patient stay in the hospital, as it has been reported earlier [Greensill et al., 2003; Semple et al., 2005; Xiao et al., 2010]. The high viral load of hMPV detected in our patients with lower respiratory tract infection may suggest a correlation between the severity of clinical symptoms and the virus replication rate, as described elsewhere [Boivin et al., 2002; Gerna et al., 2007; Bosis et al., 2008; Peng et al., 2010].",

Genotype A has been reported as the predominant genotype in respiratory samples [Bastien et al., 2003; Boivin et al., 2003; Maggi et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003], but other studies have documented the presence of both genotypes A and B [Huck et al., 2006; Regev et al., 2006; Matsuzaki et al., 2008].",
