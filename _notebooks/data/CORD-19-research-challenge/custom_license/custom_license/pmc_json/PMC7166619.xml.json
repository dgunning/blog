            "text": "Acute respiratory infection is one of the leading causes of child and adult morbidity and mortality throughout the world [Williams et al., 2002]. Determining the etiological diagnoses of patients who have respiratory symptoms remains a challenge both in the clinic and laboratory. Differentiating infections caused by influenza viruses from those caused by other respiratory viruses is essential for case management, as illustrated during the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic (A/H1N1p). Many definitions of influenza\u2010like illness (ILI) have been used worldwide in influenza surveillance; however, the sensitivity and positive predictive value of such definitions significantly vary depending on the co\u2010circulation of other respiratory viruses in the community [Boivin et al., 2000; Lee et al., 2011; Thursky et al., 2003]. The identification of the respiratory viruses that are responsible for influenza\u2010like illness has been reported in many countries, and the percentage of positive swabs for at least one virus ranges from 32% to 65% [Bellei et al., 2008; Laguna\u2010Torres et al., 2009; Ren et al., 2009; Buecher et al., 2010; Renois et al., 2010; Razanajatovo et al., 2011]. Influenza\u2010like illness can be attributed to a wide range of respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses, adenoviruses (AdV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), enteroviruses (EVs), human rhinovirus (HRV), and parainfluenza viruses (PiVs) [Bellei et al., 2008; Laguna\u2010Torres et al., 2009; Ren et al., 2009; Buecher et al., 2010; Renois et al., 2010; Razanajatovo et al., 2011]. Recently, several viruses have been associated with respiratory infections, including human metapneumovirus (hMPV) [van den Hoogen et al., 2001], human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV\u2010NL63) [van der Hoek et al., 2004], human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoVHKU1) [Woo et al., 2005], as well as human bocavirus (HBoV) [Allander et al., 2005]. Three novel polyomaviruses, KIPyV, WUPyV, and MCPyV, have been detected recently in the respiratory tracts of humans; however, their pathogenicity remains controversial [Norja et al., 2007; Babakir\u2010Mina et al., 2011].",

Few studies have described epidemiological and clinical data for different respiratory viruses that were identified to be circulating during the A/H1N1p pandemic [Hombrouck et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2011; Raboni et al., 2011; Smit et al., 2011a, b].

After obtaining oral consent, epidemiological and clinical questionnaires were completed while the patients waited for the RIDT result to be sent back by the POC lab. Patients with negative RIDT results returned home with isolation measures recommended until the result of the rRT\u2010PCR assay was obtained. When the rRT\u2010PCR results were obtained 12 hr later, patients with positive samples were contacted by telephone, and those with co\u2010morbidity risk factors were proposed for hospitalization, oseltamivir therapy, and isolation measures. For those without co\u2010morbidity risk factors, only symptomatic treatment was recommended.",
