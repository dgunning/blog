            "text": "Yellow head virus (YHV) has been emerging for the past two decades in Thailand. Virulence of the virus is known to cause devastation in shrimp farming 2\u20133 days after the onset of disease. The infected shrimp exhibits yellow coloration on cephalothorax area and pale color throughout the body. The enormous economical loss of shrimp production in Thailand by YHV infection started from 1991\u20131995. In the latter years of yellow head disease outbreak, the diagnostic of YHV contamination in post-larvae must be determined prior to culturing. Therefore, the promising preventive methods of the disease have to be considered. The attenuation or inhibition of YHV propagation is one of the preventive methods for developing antiviral agents nowadays. YHV is classified in the order of Nidovirales, genus Okavirus, and family Roniviridae. The rod-shaped virus contains positive single-stranded RNA as a genomic material with approximately 26 kbp. Structural protein components of the virus are composed of three major types including gp116, gp64 spike glycoprotein, and p20 nucleocapsid protein [1, 2]. Among viral genetic variation, the genotypes of YHV are closely related to the Gill-associated virus (GAV) that is less virulent (or provides less virulence). A recent study revealed that YHV are composed of five open reading frames (ORFs) [3]. Among those, the ORF1ab encodes for chymotrypsin-like proteinase (3CLP), nidovirus accessory protease, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which have been known to be involved in the replication complexes, and also contained the metal-ion binding domain (MIB) [4]. Chymotrypsin-like proteinase (3CLP) was first and well characterized in GAV. The enzyme employs a \u201cCys-His catalytic dyad\u201d and possesses trans-cleavage activity [4, 5]. The sequence alignment showed that 3CLP of GAV successfully located between I2866 and G3006 in YHV and interestingly, the putative 3CLP of YHV shared remarkably high identities (up to 87.9 %) in their amino acid sequences. Moreover, the two proteolytic cleavage sites for 3CLP; 2838LVTHE\u2193VNTGN2847 and 6455KVNHE\u2193LYHVA6464 (the cleavage site is indicated by \u2193) are conserved between the GAV and YHV sequences. However, the specific role of 3CLP in YHV is yet unclear. It has been postulated that the 3CLP in YHV is involved in the regulation of viral replication complex activity [4], like 3CLP in other Coronaviruses that process the downstream replicase domains including RdRp and helicase enzyme [6]. The other encoding protease that is found in both YHV and CLP is Nidovirus accessory protease that is widely known as papain-like protease (PLP). This enzyme contains the canonical \u201cCys-His catalytic dyad\u201d and a distinctive \u03b1+\u03b2 fold that is typically found in proteins that function as transcription factor involved in subgenomic messenger RNA (sgmRNA) synthesis [3]. However, the sequence alignment showed that, unlike the 3CLP, the PLP of YHV and GAV share only 73.7 % identities in their amino acid sequences [3].",

Therefore, this viral protease could possibly be a potential target in therapeutic approach, likewise the development of viral protease inhibitors (PI) for HIV-1, HCV, and SARS, illustrate a high achievement in drug pharmaceutical. The 3CLP-specific inhibitors were rationally designed based on the three-dimensional structure of the viral proteases with computer-assisted molecular modeling. The X-ray crystallographic determining the three-dimensional structure thus provide a better in-depth understanding of the association of proteins and their other target peptides. Unfortunately, crystal structure of YHV protease is not yet available; a computer-assisted homology modeling of 3CLP of YHV is currently in progress in order to obtain the molecular basis of protease cleavage site.",

In this study, the homology modeling approach was used to construct the 3D structure of the YHV protease. Molecular docking based virtual screening of synthetic small molecules from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) diversity set against the YHV protease model was performed. The program Autodock4 is used as the docking tool in this study for several reasons. First, AutoDock is widely used among docking programs in the market. In 2006, AutoDock was the most cited docking software. Second, AutoDock is free of charge to access. Last, AutoDock has also been shown to be useful in blind docking in which the location of the binding site is not known. It is very fast, provides high quality predictions of ligand conformations, and good correlations between predicted inhibition constants and experimental ones. The complexes of the protease \u2013 hit ligand were subsequently investigated for intermolecular interactions by molecular dynamics simulations.",

The amino acid sequence of the yellow head virus (YHV) protease was retrieved from the NCBI database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), covering 196 amino acid residues (Ser2828 to Asp3023) of the YHV replicase polyprotein 1a (Accession number: ACA21300). All of the template coordinates used for homology modeling were retrieved from the protein data bank (www.pdb.org), which include the eight protease enzymes from both microorganisms (tobacco etch virus, entry 1LVM; rhinovirus, entry 1CQQ; hepatitis A virus, entry 1HAV; Staphylococcus aureus, entry 1AGJ; Achromobacter lyticus, entry 1ARB) and higher organisms (bovine \u03b2-trypsin, entry 5PTP; human factor B, entry 1DLE; human heparin binding protein, entry 1A7S). All eight template sequences were multiple-aligned according to their structural superimposition of the C\u03b1 atoms on the \u201calign and superimpose proteins\u201d protocol. The YHV protease sequence was then automatically aligned to a set of aligned template sequences on the \u201calign multiple sequences\u201d protocol of which the pairwise alignment algorithm is modified from the ClustalW 1.8 [11]. This alignment protocol allows keeping the existing aligned sequences of the templates as a rigid element and thus the pre-aligned target sequence could be mobile. Sequence identities and similarities between the target and template sequences were calculated on the GeneDoc v2.7 [12]. The structural model of the YHV protease was constructed based on the unconventional sequence alignment between the target and template profile using the Modeller 9v4 [13] implemented in the \u201cbuild homology models\u201d protocol. Insertion and deletions in the target sequence with respect to the templates were defined as loops and further refined within this protocol. The best quality model with highest discrete optimized protein energy (DOPE) score was subsequently subjected to the \u201cminimization\u201d protocol based on the charmm22 force field [14] to remove unreasonable atomic contacts (steepest descent and conjugate gradient methods until the model reaching 0.1 kcal mol\u22121  \u00c5-1 convergence). The stereochemical qualities of the energy-minimized model were assessed by PROCHECK v3.5 [15] via submitting the coordinates to the JCSG structure validation server (www.jcsg.org).",

Each solvated system was energy-minimized by two steps using the steepest descent method either until the maximum force is smaller than 1000 kJ mol\u22121 nm-1 on any atom or until additional steps result in a potential energy change of less than 1 kJ mol\u22121 to reduce undesirable atomic contacts. At first, positioned restraints with a force constant of 1000 kJ mol\u22121 nm-1 were applied to all heavy atoms of the proteins and ligands (if presented), allowing water molecules and counterions to relax their position. Second, the restrains on proteins and ligands were released, then allowing all atoms in a system to freely move in turn. Afterward, the energy-minimized systems were equilibrated in three phases with the positioned restraints described earlier. The first step is heating up each system from 50 to 300 K over 50 ps under the NVT condition using the Berendsen thermostat [31, 32]. The following step is conducted under the NPT condition at 1 bar pressure over 100 ps using the Parrinello-Rahman barostat [33, 34]. Once each system was sufficiently equilibrated around the target temperature and pressure, the positioned restraints were then gradually reduced to zero kJ mol\u22121 nm-1 with four rounds of 50 ps\u2014NPT simulations. After the equilibrations, an unrestrained dynamics production was subsequently performed under the NPT condition with snapshots collected every 1 ps. For all dynamics runs, the LINCS algorithm [35] was applied to fix all hydrogen related bond lengths, facilitating the use of a 2 f. time step. A short-range nonbonded interaction cut-off distance of 1.0 nm was used. The particle mesh Ewald method was used to account for long-range electrostatics [36, 37].",

            "text": "We performed a comparative modeling approach using multiple templates followed by an energy minimization to construct a theoretical model for the YHV protease. Because a multiple alignment is the key step in homology modeling, our model was cautiously done since there is only limited sequence identity to such templates. Ab initio modeling and protein threading are now very effective and invaluable methods to use for structural prediction of non- or low- template identity proteins, and their online version are currently accessible [41\u201347]. In our case, the search for template coordinates available from the protein data bank performed on several BLAST and threading web-servers did not provide us with the consensus template structures or a satisfied model (data not shown), and none of them exhibits acceptable percentage of identities/similarities to the YHV protease. A tertiary structure of the YHV protease should have significant conserved fold like other proteases, and thus allow the development of our own method used for the target-template sequence alignment as described in the Materials and methods section. The model templates used in this study were selected according to an extremely high structural similarity in the two-domain antiparallel \u03b2-barrel fold, which is the hallmark of trypsin-like proteases even though these structures exhibit a limited sequence identity to the YHV protease, ranging from 14 to 20 % of the aligned regions (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The selected templates were three cysteine proteases from tobacco etch virus (PDB entry 1LVM) [48], rhinovirus (PDB entry 1CQQ) [49], hepatitis A virus (PDB entry 1HAV) [50], and the other five proteases of non-viral proteins, bovine \u03b2-trypsin (PDB entry 5PTP) [51], protease domain of human factor B (PDB entry 1DLE) [52], epidermolytic toxin B from Staphylococcus aureus (PDB entry 1AGJ), lysine-specific protease I from Achromobacter lyticus (PDB entry 1ARB) [53], and trypsin-like folded human heparin binding protein (PDB entry 1A7S) [54].\n\n",

Although the overall fold of the YHV protease seemed closer to those of the non-viral serine proteases than the three viral cysteine proteases, the atomic coordinates of the catalytic triad residues, His30, Asp(Glu)70, and Cys152 (numbering of YHV protease) were highly conserved among the four viral C-type cysteine proteases; yellow head, tobacco etch, rhino- and hepatitis A viruses (Fig. 2c). These also indicated a high accuracy of the modeled YHV protease and it was reasonable to use this model for subsequent docking experiments.\n",

All 1364 compounds from NCI diversity II were docked into the modeled structure of YHV-protease, 43 compounds were selected from this screening step based on docking scores. The expected results showed several sets of the ligand-protein binding mode. Therefore, the FRED program combinations with SiMMap server (http://simmap.life.nctu.edu.tw/) were used to justify the reliable possibility of the binding mode. The SiMMap server was used to identify the site-moiety map between the functional group(s) of these ligands to the residues around the binding site (Fig. 3). As shown in the SiMMap moieties, there were four spheres which represent two types of interactions. H moiety refered to the hydrogen bonding, while V moiety refered to van der Waals force. Anchor H1 illustrated the binding residues; Asp149 and Cys152 prefer to form hydrogen bonding interactions with the following functional groups; hydroxyl, 1\u00b0 amine, azo (also named diimide or diazene compound), hydrazine and carboxamide moieties. Similar to anchor H1, H2 specified the consistent functional groups with the position Gly170 which are ether, carbonyl, amide, alcohol, and sulfonyl groups, respectively. For anchor H3, Ser173 plays the role that interacts with ether, nitro, sulphonyl, carboxy, and carboxamide groups. In additional, the van der Waals interactions between three residues around binding pocket; Lys148, Gly170, and Ala172, and the hydrophobic moieties; phenol, benzene, alkene etc. were represented by V1 anchor. These analyses assisted us to understand the mode of binding of ligands and to classify ligand-group which followed the interaction modes.\n",

These features were also found in our 11 candidate compounds from 32 compounds in group one which contains aromatic moiety, carboximide, hydroxy, carbonyl, ether, and ester groups. All 11 two-dimensional structures as well as properties were presented in Table 2. In order to better understand the mode of actions of these small molecules via strong hydrogen bonds, the orientations of Nelfinavir, a representative of known protease inhibitors, and compound NSC319990 (the best docking score with carboximide functional group, Rank3) have been compared. The post-docking analyses revealed that one-half of NSC319990 is oriented at the same area as Nelfinavir. These two molecules lay along the sub-sites S2 (H30, S67-D70, I168 and V169) to S1 (T147, K148, D149 and H167) of YHV protease. There are three common types of binding between these two compounds as presented in Fig. 5. First, \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction between 6-membered aromatic ring and residue His30 (one of the catalytic triad) have been observed from both compounds. Second, the dipole-dipole electrostatic interaction between ligands and binding residues in pocket A, Asp149, and Cys152 were formed. N-atom of decahydroisoquinoline of Nelfinavir, and S-atom of benzo(d)thiazole of NSC319990 held the negative dipole and acted as nucleophile to form interaction with either thiol group of Cys152 or carboxylic group of Asp149. Third, the van der Waals interactions between the residues Gly170 and Ala172, which were defined as V1 anchor, and the fused rings of both compounds have been monitored. Considering at the compound NSC319990, as mentioned above, one-half of this compound is perfectly occupied on the binding pocket along the sub-site S2 to S1 of YHV protease. Moreover, another-half of NSC319990 lies on the S3 sub-pocket (M137, I168-I171, and A180-T182). These observations suggested that the screened compounds might possess the protease inhibitor properties as the known one, Nelfinavir. These sets of ligands not only possessed strong hydrogen bonds with the surrounded residues in the binding pocket but also are reported as the potent inhibitory agents targeting several proteins including the malarial parasite plastid (Table 2).\n\n",

The backbone RMSD values of each snapshot with respect to the initial structures obtained before energy minimizations were plotted over the course of 15 ns simulation time (Supplementary data Fig. S2). Although the RMSD values for the apo simulation tended to be more deviated from the initial structure, those for the complex simulations had reached equilibrium well after t = 5 ns and remained fluctuated not more than \u22480.1 nm until the end of the simulations, indicating stability of the complex systems. Potential energies for interactions between the hit compounds and the enzyme were calculated as the sum of the electrostatic and van der Waals (vdW) energies over the last 5 ns of the simulations (Fig. 6). It is noted that vdW interactions were found to be stronger than electrostatic interactions in all cases. The compounds NSC345647 and NSC319990 contribute more interaction energies than the other three complexes. These results are consistent with the docking observations in that both compounds are the first two hits among the five. Numbers of hydrogen bonds between the five hit compounds and the enzyme were then investigated throughout the 15 ns in all complex simulations (Supplementary data Fig. S3). List of the interaction pairs and percentage of occupancy were shown in Table 3. The analyses showed that the compounds NSC345647 and NSC319990 exhibit the largest hydrogen bond contributions among the five complexes as expected (Table 3). In particular, the compound NSC319990 makes strong hydrogen bonds with several residues including the catalytic triad of the protease (Fig. 7). Among these, the interaction between the N3 and N4 atoms of the compound and the side chain of Asp70 exhibits stability with the highest bond occupancy (95.8 % and 69.5 %, respectively). The Asp149 side chain (in pocket A) also makes strong hydrogen bonds with the N atoms of the compound (63.4 % and 61.6 %). Furthermore, the \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction between the 6-membered aromatic ring of the compound and His30 was observed (data not shown). These strong hydrogen bonds observed in the NSC319990 complex are in agreement with the observations from molecular docking.\n\n\n",
