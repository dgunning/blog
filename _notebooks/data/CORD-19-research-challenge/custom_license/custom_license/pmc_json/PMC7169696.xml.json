In contrast, in mainland China most documented SARS transmission occurred in the community (Feng et al. 2009). Nonetheless, significant nosocomial transmission did occur, and healthcare workers (HCWs) were the largest single group of workers affected, accounting for 19.2% of all reported cases (Feng et al. 2009). While in some hospitals clinical features and therapeutic approaches have been documented (Wu et al. 2003; Zou et al. 2004; Wang et al. 2006), and previous modelling studies have estimated the importance of different transmission routes in hospital settings (Kwok et al. 2007), there have been no attempts to quantify the time\u2010evolution of SARS transmissibility in hospital settings in mainland China.",

This number will change during the course of an epidemic as a result of changing control measures and declining numbers of susceptibles (and perhaps also environmental factors). A necessary condition for a major epidemic to occur is that this number is initially greater than the threshold value of one, enabling a sustained chain of transmission to occur. A sufficient condition for successful control of an epidemic (indeed, a practical definition of control) is that this number is maintained below one. If this happens, though continued transmission may occur, it will be at a level too low to permit the self\u2010sustaining chain reaction that constitutes an epidemic, and eventual fade\u2010out is assured. By tracking the value of R\nt over time it is possible to quantify the degree of ongoing transmission and to see how far from successful control an epidemic is at a given time point (Wallinga & Teunis 2004).",

(2003). Transmission in the community resulting from cases with onset outside the hospital was not considered in the analysis. For the purpose of the analysis, for those with onset outside the hospital, the onset time was taken as the admission time. It was necessary to modify the method slightly for the analysis of hospital A data, where several cases believed to be infected by contact with patients in hospital A were visiting relatives in hospital and were admitted to another hospital on developing symptoms. In the analysis, these cases were assumed to have been infected by cases within hospital A, but not to pose any risk of transmission to other patients within hospital A. Mortality data were analysed using a logistic regression model.",

However, the lack of information on the number of susceptibles makes assessing the importance of specific control measures for reducing transmission impossible: once the hospitals were closed to new admissions, a decline in the effective reproduction number would be expected as the supply of susceptibles diminishes during the course of the epidemic. Without knowledge of the number of susceptible staff and patients the relative importance of this mechanism compared to other control measures for the control of SARS transmission cannot be assessed.",

            "text": "Nonetheless, we can speculate on the importance of control measures. It seems plausible that the increasingly rapid isolation of cases was partly responsible for the sharp reduction in the effective reproduction number in hospitals B and C. Unfortunately with available data it is only possible to confirm this trend for increasingly rapid isolation in hospital B (Figure 3). While the change in R\nt in hospital C showed a similar pattern to that in hospital B, the initial value of R\nt was somewhat higher and the time to successful control was shorter. Possible reasons for the more rapid control in hospital C include the fact that the outbreak in hospital C occurred some days after the hospital B outbreak, and patients may therefore have been isolated faster or more effectively as a result of the experience gained from the earlier outbreak. However, lack of data from hospital C regarding isolation times makes this impossible to establish. In hospital A, the progressive reductions in the net reproduction number (R\nt) are most likely to have resulted from the early isolation measures, health education, disinfection measures and transfer of SARS patients to an infectious diseases hospital. However, high\u2010risk exposures caused by visitors to the hospital who were infected with SARS\u2010CoV could have caused the observed increase in the estimated reproduction number over the first few days of the epidemic.",

Maximal values were between 10 and 15 compared to maximum values for Beijing as a whole of only three or four. This provides confirmation of the view that hospitals have the potential to amplify transmission (Lloyd\u2010Smith et al. 2003). This probably reflects the high frequency of close contacts seen in hospital environments, and similar findings might be expected in other closed communities such as schools or military barracks. The results also suggest that the requirements for control would be considerably more stringent for a hospital population compared to the wider community. For example, a higher proportion of the population would need to be vaccinated to prevent an outbreak, or the effectiveness of isolation measures would need to be greater to guarantee control. Fortunately, the fact that all (or almost all) SARS transmission appears to be from symptomatic individuals means that even with reproduction numbers as high as those observed here isolation of cases is likely to be able to control outbreaks provided isolation measures are close to fully effective (Fraser et al. 2004). In contrast, the lower transmission potential in the community means that even isolation measures that only about 75% effective at preventing transmission would suffice to control an outbreak. Such imperfect isolation would not be able to control outbreaks for the highest reproduction numbers seen in these hospital settings.",
