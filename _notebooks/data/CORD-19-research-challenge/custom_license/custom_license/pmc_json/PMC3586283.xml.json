This organ\u2010specific autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) is characterized by the loss of the protective myelin sheath surrounding the axons of neurons, resulting in \u2018plaque\u2019 formation (2, 3). Plaques denote areas in which myelin has been lost. Loss of myelin and plaque formation is mainly attributed to myelin\u2010specific CD4+ T cells that cross the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) and consequently destroy the myelin sheath (4, 5, 6). Upon destruction of myelin, saltatory axonal conduction is disrupted leading to loss of neurologic function. Symptoms include cognitive impairment, muscle weakness, spasms, ataxia, and paralysis (7).",

It is clear that genetics contributes significantly to disease susceptibility. Identical twins develop MS with a 25\u201330% concordance rate, and there is an increased chance of developing disease among siblings as compared to the incidence in the general population (8). Susceptibility is most closely linked to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DR [major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II] locus, and more recently, disease has been more loosely linked to multiple immune\u2010related genes, including interleukin 2 receptor alpha (IL2RA) and IL7RA alleles (9, 10). Thus, it is clear that genetics contributes importantly to MS susceptibility, but there is a large body of epidemiological evidence supporting an equally important role for infections as an inducing stimulus.",

Outbreaks of MS have also occurred in isolated populations, for example, in native inhabitants of the Faroe and Shetland\u2010Orkney Islands, after prolonged exposure to non\u2010native individuals during World War II (11, 12, 13). This suggests that the possibility that exposure of genetically susceptible individuals to environmental pathogens may be involved in the induction of MS. More direct evidence for this hypothesis comes from reported isolation of viral proteins and RNA from MS plaques. Overall, over two dozen different viruses have been reportedly linked to MS over the past four decades (14, 15). Confirmation of the vast majority of these findings is lacking, and more recent reports have correlated MS with infections by human herpes virus type 6 and Epstein\u2010Barr virus (EBV) (16).",

Immunization induced autoreactive T\u2010cell responses to MBP; however, the animals failed to develop clinical disease (19). Subsequent studies employed transgenic mice expressing lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), viral antigens expressed in the pancreas under control of the rat insulin promoter.

TMEV is a single\u2010stranded virus of the picornoviridae family, which is a natural enteric pathogen of mice and rats (30). TMEV is a neurotropic virus that can replicate and persist within the CNS. Intracerebral infection of susceptible inbred mouse strains (e.g. SJL/J) with wildtype TMEV can lead to the induction of a late\u2010onset demyelinating disease, termed TMEV\u2010induced demyelinating disease (TMEV\u2010IDD) which is similar in pathology to MS, via the process of epitope spreading (17, 31).

Inflammation and demyelination were observed in the lower lumbar spinal cord of these animals. This increased pathology was quite striking and was the first evidence that a self\u2010epitope processed from whole virus could be presented to autoreactive T cells resulting in initiation of demyelinating disease. Significantly, it should be noted that innate signals provided by TMEV, a positive strand RNA virus, were sufficient to induce the early onset \u2018EAE\u2010like\u2019 disease and did not require exogenous priming with other TLR agonists [e.g. complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant (CFA) containing Mycobacteria].

Given the wide genetic diversity of individuals displaying a particular autoimmune disease, it is highly unlikely that any one infectious agent will be found to be exclusively associated with a disease. Depending on the genetics of the individual, it is possible that an autoimmune disease could be triggered by a variety of infectious agents contingent on many variables. These variables could include the number of potential cross\u2010reactive epitopes encoded by the pathogen, the ability of the infectious agent to activate the innate immune system via stimulation of pattern recognition receptors, such as TLRs, the cellular/tissue tropism of the agent, the route of infection, and the age and immune repertoire of the affected individual at the time of infection. Significantly, progression of mimicry\u2010induced autoimmune disease can be mediated by additional mechanisms, including epitope spreading, thus these two potential mechanisms for initiation of infection\u2010induced autoimmune disease are not mutually exclusive.
