The most commonly reported viral causes are biased due to available testing, but include influenza A or B, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and parainfluenza. In the post-pneumococcal vaccine era in the United States, increased rates of invasive pneumococcal pneumonia during the respiratory viral infection season has been reported in association with RSV, influenza, adenovirus and hMPV.

Mycoplasma pneumonia usually has a diffuse bilateral interstitial appearance on radiograph, although it can also be seen with lower lobe consolidations and effusions. The preferred imaging is for two views of the chest, frontal (usually posteroanterior), and lateral (to see the retrocardiac area) for initial evaluation.
