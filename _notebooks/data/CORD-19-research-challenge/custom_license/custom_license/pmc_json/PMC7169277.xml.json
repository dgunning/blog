Moreover, the mean value found in the captive group was higher than all reported for wild canids in captivity.24 Possible explanations for eosinophilia in canids are hypersensitivity reactions, estrus, recent pregnancy or parturition, neoplasms, and endoparasitism;20 among them, the latter seems to be the most probable cause. Unfortunately, fecal examinations were not performed, so endoparasite richness and burden could not be compared between groups and assessed for association with eosinophilia. Even though free\u2010ranging Sechuran foxes do not receive any antiparasitic treatment, environment might play a key role in keeping a low parasite burden; thus, dryness, heat, aridity, and lack of shadow in the dry forest may diminish the chances for parasite survival and transmission.25, 26 On the other hand, captive Sechuran fox enclosures have grass substrate and are frequently watered. Moreover, other factors such as population density (higher in the captive group than in free\u2010ranging foxes, which are known to be solitary)2 and the presence of pest animals (eg, cats, squirrels) inside the zoos might contribute to an increased parasitism rate in captive Sechuran foxes. Besides, it is widely known that free\u2010ranging wild animals are more resistant to parasites than captive ones, as the latter have more predisposing factors affecting the ecology of parasitic diseases, such as stress, overpopulation, and weather.26, 27 This result would suggest the currently performed preventive antiparasitic program might not be effective enough in the assessed captive populations.",

With regard to Sechuran fox WBC morphology, the observed oval eosinophil granules differ from the round ones described in other canids.31, 32 This morphologic peculiarity might be related to phylogenetic separation of the Lycalopex genus from other canids genera,33 but further studies are needed to confirm and elucidate such observation.",

Corticoids increase serum lipase by stimulating lipolysis.38 This would be considered an expected finding, as elapsed time from capture to chemical immobilization was higher in free\u2010ranging foxes (eg, ~1\u201310 h) than in the captive group (eg, ~5\u201315 min), and plasma glucocorticoids levels increase when wild animals remain captured.39 This explanation might be supported by the finding of statistically significant correlation between the segmented neutrophil count and the serum lipase level, which are known to increase as a result of stress. However, direct measurement of glucocorticoids was not performed in this study, so this hypothetical explanation could not be fully proved.",

As total bilirubin is the sum of indirect and direct bilirubin, the observed difference between groups would be attributable to the indirect bilirubin concentration. High bilirubin values are mainly found as a consequence of increased hemolysis, hepatic failure, or biliary obstruction.20 However, no such problems were diagnosed in the assessed animals, so the explanation for this finding remains unclear. A similar difference was observed in captive wombats (Lasiorhinus latifrons) when compared to free\u2010ranging ones, but no specific explanation was provided for such a finding.40\n",

This difference might be related to different feeding habits between these species, as L culpaeus is almost strictly carnivorous41, while L sechurae is omnivorous with marked seasonal variations (ie, it is almost strictly frugivorous during dry season).1, 2\n",

This finding would suggest lifestyle\u2010associated factors might be more influential on the assessed variables than sex\u2010associated factors. This affirmation is in accordance with previous studies showing a higher number of hematologic and serum biochemical differences between populations of free\u2010ranging Maned Wolves (Chrysocyon brachyurus) than between sexes.10, 42 Moreover, the observed higher number of variables found to be significantly different between captive and free\u2010ranging animals when partitioning data for males and females in comparison to results of both sexes combined (9 variables) indicate that combining sexes may hide differences in some variables. The higher number of variables found to be significantly different between captive and free\u2010ranging females (9 variables) when compared to differences between captive and free\u2010ranging males (6 variables) suggests that response to life condition differs between sexes. Thus, female Sechuran foxes seem to be more sensitive to changes in lifestyle than males. Moreover, it should be noted that free\u2010ranging animals were captured throughout an entire year, whereas captive foxes were sampled within 1 month. As hormonal levels vary throughout seasons,43 such cycles may be tampered in the captive group and might have influenced the observed differences in the assessed variables. Only differences in MCHC, lipase, and albumin were equally observed in females and males when separately assessed, suggesting these are not affected by sex. Interestingly, MCH, eosinophil count, and amylase activity were significantly different only between male Sechuran foxes, whereas urea, AST, ALT, cholesterol, total bilirubin, and albumin were significantly different only in female Sechuran foxes. These findings suggest that hematologic and serum biochemical differences may be mainly associated with males and females, respectively. It is noteworthy to mention that small sample sizes within each subset (ie, captive females, captive males, free\u2010ranging females, free\u2010ranging males) would be a source of bias making the observed findings questionable.",

Therefore, our results should be carefully considered as the first approach to this topic, which is currently still lacking information. Furthermore, regarding the anesthetic drugs used in this study, neither ketamine nor dexmedetomidine have been reported to affect any of the assessed hematologic or serum biochemical variables in wild canids. However, as there is scarce information on such potential preanalytic aspects, the absence of any effect is debatable and should be also considered a limitation of this study.",
