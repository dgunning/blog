In a case of meningoencephalitis (specimen 07/03981), we sequenced a 1,297-nt fragment comprising the near complete 5\u2032-UTR and the first 489 nt of the structural protein gene (leader, viral protein [VP] 4 domain, and upstream VP2 domain, GenBank accession no. JN209931). Despite repeated trials, further sequence fragments could be amplified neither from the specimen from this patient nor from that from the second patient with meningoencephalitis that showed very low virus concentrations (specimen VI1607). From the specimen from the SIDS patient (specimen 347/10), amplification of the complete structural genome and partial nonstructural genome was successful (5,333 nt, GenBank accession no. JN209932). This virus belonged to hCV genotype 2 in the VP1 genomic region (i.e., the region used for the designation of genotypes) (Figure, panel A). The CSF specimen 07/03981 was also phylogenetically related to genotype 2 viruses in the 5\u2032-UTR and Leader-VP2 genomic regions (Figure, panels B and C). On the basis of the 5\u2032-UTR sequences, the closest known relative to both viruses was D/VI2229, obtained in Germany in 2004 (nucleotide percentage distance 4.7% for the SIDS specimen and 0.9% for the CSF specimen). In the structural protein gene fragment, the closest relative of both viruses was a strain obtained in the Netherlands in 2008 (Nijmegen2008, nucleotide distance 13.9% for the SIDS specimen and 3.5% for the CSF specimen). This suggested geographic rather than phylogenetic clustering of viruses detected within and beyond the respiratory and enteric tracts. However, formal and final virus typing is pending because VP1 regions could not be sequenced from 2 viruses.",

A low detection rate in CSF does not contradict a general potential of these viruses to cause meningoencephalitis, as exemplified by enteroviruses for which lack of detection in CSF despite clear association with disease is not uncommon (10). Considering links between the related Theilovirus and demyelinating disease in laboratory models (1), long-term outcomes of patients with hCV infection of the central nervous system should be followed up. Such longitudinal studies should include sufficient numbers of patients because natural infections with Theilovirus in rodents are common and will less frequently result in multiple sclerosis\u2013like disease than in laboratory models (1). The rarity of hCV detection in our study suggests the assembly of such cohorts to be a difficult and lengthy task that could benefit greatly from international coordination.",

Although we were able to classify the virus detected in the child who died of SIDS as a common genotype 2, the partial hCV sequence from a patient with meningitis did not permit typing because hCVs, as all picornaviruses, recombine frequently (15).
