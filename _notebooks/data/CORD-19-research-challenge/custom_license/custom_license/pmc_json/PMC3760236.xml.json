This was suggested by recent studies of Enterococcus faecalis V583, a commensal of the human intestine. When E. faecalis V583 colonizes the intestines of mice, it produces lytic phages derived from chromosomally encoded prophage elements14. Production of the phage particles confers an advantage to E. faecalis V583 in competition with closely related enterococcus strains. This indicates that phages have the potential to influence the assembly and composition of intestinal bacterial communities14. Phage predation may be widespread, as suggested by the presence of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) systems in many human commensal bacteria. CRISPRs are genetic modules in which short repeats of foreign DNA are inserted between spacer sequences in the bacterial chromosome. The spacer sequences are transcribed into short complementary RNAs that target invading DNA for destruction. Bacteria of the gastrointestinal tract and oral mucosa have acquired CRISPR-specific spacer sequences homologous to phage DNA6,17, suggesting that commensal bacteria are preyed upon by lytic phages in the mammalian host.",

It is well established that certain bacterial groups have distinctive effects on maturation of the immune system. For example, individual commensal species in the intestine influence the proportions of lamina propria T lymphocyte subsets that have distinct effector functions18,19. This in turn has profound effects on whether proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory immunity develops. Furthermore, commensal bacteria specifically limit and promote viral infection and transmission in mammalian hosts20,21,22. It is thus interesting to consider whether phage predation of intestinal bacteria could alter community composition in ways that impact function of the immune system and influence the spread of pathogenic viruses.",

For example, most metagenomic studies of human-associated viral populations have focused on analyzing viral DNA content. A more complete characterization of RNA viruses associated with humans will undoubtedly provide a more complete picture of the virobiota. Furthermore, as noted above, it remains unclear whether the eukaryotic viruses associated with healthy human mucosal tissues are the result of chronic or latent infections or whether they arise from acute but transient viral infections. Careful longitudinal metagenomic studies of viral populations associated with mucosal tissue will be required to resolve these issues and to identify those viruses that stably inhabit human tissues.",

In the intestine, for example, the immune system has a central role in controlling the density and the composition of resident bacterial communities33,34. Recent studies in primates suggest that there is a similar relationship between the immune system and the intestinal virobiota. Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), a primate virus related to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), causes AIDS in rhesus monkeys. SIV infection of rhesus monkeys is associated with damage to the intestinal barrier (enteropathy), which promotes AIDS progression. Until recently, the causes of this enteropathy have not been clear. A metagenomic study of the virome of SIV-infected rhesus monkeys showed that SIV infection is associated with a dramatic expansion of the intestinal virome4. This viral expansion was associated with enteropathy, particularly in monkeys that harbored adenoviruses (Fig. 2). These findings suggest that virome expansion is linked to the pathology observed in AIDS and highlights the role of the immune system in controlling virus populations in the intestine.",

The lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis have many retrotranscribing RNA viruses and human herpes viruses, including Epstein-Barr virus, which has been linked to poor clinical outcomes in children with cystic fibrosis. The lung virome of patients with cystic fibrosis is highly variable as compared to healthy human lungs, where virome composition is relatively constant36. It has been proposed that viruses in healthy lungs may cause short-term infections that are rapidly cleared by the host immune system, whereas in the lung of a patient with cystic fibrosis these viruses may be more persistent36, perhaps as a result of compromised host immunity. The metabolic profile of the lung of a patient with cystic fibrosis suggests that it is enriched in aromatic amino acids and phosphate36. This may influence the outgrowth of bacterial species that can shape the virobiota and possibly alter the severity of disease. It is intriguing to consider that competition among bacteria in the lungs and the success of certain species based on the metabolic environment may modulate the composition of virobiota in the lungs, ultimately leading to progression of disease if host immunity is compromised.",

These infections are caused by a variety of different viruses, including papillomaviruses, herpes viruses and polyomaviruses, that often reside in tissues of healthy individuals (Fig. 1). Certain resident eukaryotic viruses can cause acute or latent infections that transition to chronic infections, where viral particles are shed throughout life. For example, herpes viruses infect most people during childhood, and latent herpes infection can lead to shedding of viral particles throughout the lifetime of an individual. Although latency and reactivation of herpes virus infection is considered pathogenic, chronic herpes virus infection has been shown to protect the host from viral and bacterial infections40. Protection is conferred by chronic infection with select types of herpes viruses, including \u03b3-herpes viruses, which increase basal interferon \u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) expression and facilitate activation of macrophages. This in turn limits the spread of other infecting bacteria and viruses.",

One possible uptake route involves dendritic cells, which are known to sample intestinal luminal contents50 and can actively phagocytize phage particles in culture51. Phage engulfment renders dendritic cells incapable of further phagocytosis, suggesting that phage sampling by dendritic cells could negatively impact their proinflammatory functions52. Alternatively, phage antigens could be presented by dendritic cells to T cells, resulting in the development of cell-mediated immunity and cytokine release.

            "text": "It is also interesting to consider whether bacteriophages might elicit antiviral innate immune responses. Mammalian cells are endowed with the ability to detect viral nucleic acids through several pattern-recognition receptors that are positioned to detect viral entry into cells (Fig. 3). These pattern-recognition receptors include viral RNA sensors, such as the endosomal Toll-like receptors TLR7 and TLR8, and RIG-I, a cytoplasmic double-stranded RNA helicase54. There are also DNA sensors, including TLR9, which detects endosomal DNA, and the cytoplasmic DNA sensor cyclic-GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase55,56. RIG-I can also indirectly sense viral DNA with the aid of RNA polymerase III, which converts cytoplasmic DNA into 5\u2032-phosphorylated RNA that can be recognized by RIG-I (ref. 54). Each of these sensors initiates signaling cascades that activate expression of type I interferon, inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-1\u03b2 and chemokines including IL-8 and CXCL-10. If resident bacteriophages can enter host cells, it is possible that they would activate one or more of these pathways, as their nucleic acids would likely be exposed to either the endosomal or cytoplasmic viral nucleic acid sensors (Fig. 3). This could induce a tonic stimulation of antiviral immunity that might confer an advantage to the host by protecting against pathogenic viral infections.",

Under certain conditions, such as host immunodeficiency, commensal bacteria from the intestine can enter epithelial cells or become engulfed by phagocytic cells. Phage particles associated with these bacteria could be exposed to the cytoplasm or to endocytic compartments of cells and could thus prime innate or adaptive immune responses (Fig. 3). In this way, bacteria could be delivery vehicles for phages that are sensed by the immune system.",

Most of these hypervariable regions map to phage tail-fiber genes that are diversified to allow the encoded proteins to bind variable phage receptors28. Other hypervariable regions have been observed in genes encoding predicted immunoglobulin superfamily proteins, suggesting that such proteins could act as scaffolds for the presentation of diversified phage peptide sequences. The phage diversity-generating mechanism relies on error-prone reverse transcription28,57.
