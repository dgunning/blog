Six persons reported symptoms (4 on quarantine day 2 and 2 on quarantine day 3) and were placed in isolation in a hospital and underwent polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing; all 6 persons tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. On quarantine day 3, samples from 76 of the 86 asymptomatic persons (75 nasopharyngeal swab samples and 1 nasal swab sample) were obtained and tested by means of PCR assay. A 17-year-old boy (the son of Patient 1) tested positive for Covid-19 and continued to have PCR-positive status for 2 weeks, and a 41-year-old man had an inconclusive result (positive for N gene and negative for ORF1ab gene). On quarantine day 6, samples from all 87 quarantined asymptomatic persons (85 nasopharyngeal swab samples and 2 nasal swab samples [3 of the 6 persons who had been transferred to the hospital before February 2 had returned to the government quarantine facility]) were obtained and tested; all tested negative. All persons who were not isolated in the hospital were released from quarantine on day 14, and all remained uninfected with Covid-19.
