            "text": "Canine distemper virus (CDV) is a member of the family Paramyxoviridae, genus Morbillivirus, and consists of a negative sense single\u2010stranded RNA genome about 15 690 nucleotides in length encoding six structural proteins: nucleocapsid protein (NP), phosphoprotein, matrix protein, fusion protein, haemagglutinin protein, and large polymerase protein. The CDV causes canine distemper (CD), which is an important viral disease of dogs that has a high morbidity and mortality in unvaccinated populations. It is a highly contagious acute or subacute, febrile disease that has been known since 1760 (Murphy et al., 1999).",

            "text": "A clinical diagnosis of CD is difficult because the main clinical signs (nasal discharge and diarrhoea) are similar to other respiratory and enteric diseases (Jones et al., 1997). Currently, CD is a tentative diagnosis for dogs showing clinical signs of nervous system disease or chronic antibiotic\u2010unresponsive respiratory disease. The more specific clinical signs of CD such as convulsions, lack of coordination and myoclonus occur more often in the later stages of infection after CDV infection has been established in the central nervous system (Moro et al., 2003). Furthermore, the variable clinical presentations of CD make it a difficult disease to diagnose. Therefore, an early diagnosis of the infection is important for quarantining infected dogs and providing an appropriate treatment. For this reason, a sensitive, specific and rapid method is needed to detect a small quantity of the virus early in an infection.",

This assay is also rapid, requiring only 4 h to detect the viral nucleic acid. However, it can only be performed in a diagnostic or commercial laboratory with access to specialized equipment that is not generally available to veterinary clinics. A new technique, reverse transcription loop\u2010mediated isothermal amplification (RT\u2010LAMP), is an auto\u2010cycling strand displacement DNA synthesis carried out using a reverse transcriptase and DNA polymerase with a high strand displacement activity and a set of specific primers that can recognize a total of six distinct sequences in the target cDNA (Notomi et al., 2000; Hong et al., 2004). This technique amplifies the target cDNA sequence with a high selectivity. The assay can also be carried out within 1 h, has a high sensitivity and produces an end\u2010product that is visible to the naked eye (Notomi et al., 2000; Mori et al., 2001).",

The RT\u2010LAMP method used for detecting CDV is highly sensitive, and it detects CDV\u2010RNA template at concentrations as low as 10\u20101TCID50 ml\u22121. A 100\u2010fold increase in sensitivity was observed with RT\u2010LAMP compared with RT\u2010PCR, where the detection limit was 10TCID50 ml\u22121.

However, 65\u00b0C was used as the optimal temperature because the higher temperature increases the specificity of the detection (data not shown). No amplification of product and precipitation were found in the reaction time of 15 and 30 min. However, at 45 and 60 min amplification at 65\u00b0C, precipitation and many bands of various sizes from approximately 200 bp to the loading well were produced (data not shown). Although well\u2010formed bands could be detected at 45 min, the conditions were optimized for 60 min at 65\u00b0C. In RT\u2010LAMP, reverse transcription was originally carried out prior to the PCR step (Fukuta et al., 2003) because AMV reverse transcriptase has a optimum activity near 40\u00b0C.
