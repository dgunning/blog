For BCC, no recurrences were noted after 5 years of follow-up among patients who had a primary tumor, and less than 8% of recurrent BCCs excised with the Mohs technique failed treatment. Unfortunately, 5-year follow-up was achieved in only 42% of patients. Furthermore, because the patients who were lost to follow-up had more aggressive tumors (a significantly higher percentage of infiltrating BCCs that required a greater number of levels to achieve complete excision), the authors conceded that it is \u201clikely that the results in our series underestimate the true recurrence rate.\u201d",

The task is a lot more challenging for high-risk lesions\u2014for example, recurrent or incompletely excised tumors; malignancies with indistinct margins or in areas (such as the medial canthus) with a high frequency of local invasion, recurrence, or metastasis; metatypical or morpheaform subtypes of BCC that often behave aggressively; and when maximal tissue conservation is desired. In these situations, I believe that Mohs micrographic excision affords considerable advantage.13, 14, 15, 16, 17\n",

First, although published reports suggest that no more than one third of skin cancers require Mohs excision,18, 19 a few practitioners, some of whom have no formal Mohs training, use the technique to remove lesions that could be treated satisfactorily by less invasive and less costly methods, such as cryotherapy, electrodesiccation and curettage, or perhaps even topical fluorouracil or imiquimod cream.20, 21 Second, optimal functional and aesthetic results are achieved when the dermatologist who excises the tumor works seamlessly and selflessly with reconstructive surgeons from several surgical disciplines. Turf battles preclude such collaboration in some practice environments, to the detriment of patients. Mohs surgeons have assertively increased their repertoire of flaps and grafts during the past 2 decades, which likely has resulted in decreased referrals from some plastic surgeons, otolaryngologists, and ophthalmologists of patients who might benefit from Mohs excision.",
