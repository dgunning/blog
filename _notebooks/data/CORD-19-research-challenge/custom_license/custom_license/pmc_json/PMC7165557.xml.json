            "text": "Rotaviruses and coronaviruses rank, along with bacterial infections, among the most significant causal agents of gastroenteritis in pigs. The two coronaviruses causing transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) and porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) are morphologically identical, but they are antigenically different. TGE gastroenteritis, occurring mostly in the enzootic form, is not such a problem in Europe as it was in the past (\u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nek et al., 1972; Pritchard et al., 1999). Although different results on the prevalence of TGEV infection were given (Kim and Cho, 1998; Chae et al., 2000), this infection still may be topical in some countries. Decreased incidence of TGE gastroenteritis is largely influenced by the spread of porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) infection in pig herds (Bernard et al., 1989; \u0160est\u00e1k et al., 1996). High level of nucleotide sequence homology (98%) of the two viruses was proven by genome analysis (Britton et al., 1991) with major deletions in genome coding S protein of PRCV. Therefore, it is presumed that PRCV is a spike (S) gene deletion mutant of TGEV, and minor alterations of the viral genome led to distinct viral tropism (Rasschaert et al., 1990; \u0160est\u00e1k et al., 1996; Ballesteros et al., 1997; Constantini et al., 2004).",

While viral antigens N and M of TGEV and PRCV are identical, differences were demonstrated in glycoprotein S epitopes, which do not trigger production of neutralizing antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to those epitopes are currently used to distinguish between TGEV and PRCV antibodies (Simkins et al., 1993). However the situation is different when detection of the virus in faecal samples is considered.",

It follows that the method of lower sensitivity based on the use of antibodies to both TGEV and PRCV antigens could be suitable for specific demonstration of TGEV in faeces. Therefore the objective of our study was to check such mAb in modifications of blocking ELISA method, and to implement the optimal one for TGEV demonstration.",

After development of cytopathic effect and centrifugation (3000 g for 15 min) of the medium, the pellet was resuspended in 1/100 of the original medium volume in phosphate\u2010buffered saline (PBS) as crude viral antigen (V\u2010Ag).

Purified V\u2010Ag was prepared from the supernatant of the infectious medium by ultracentrifugation on cushions of 20 and 45% sucrose according to Hofmann and Wyler (1990). Antigens were kept at \u221280\u00b0C before use. Culture media with known tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50/ml) were used for the determination of blocking ELISA method sensitivity. To exclude possible crossreactions with other agents, crude V\u2010Ag (TGE, PED and rota A) were tested by all ELISA methods used. The reactivities of mAb with five TGEV strains (V\u2010344, Shizuoka, Purdue, and two of our field isolates Cz\u20101970 and Cz\u20101995) were also examined.",

All were of the isotype IgG1 and reacted with the membrane protein M (D7/G7) and nucleoprotein N (B7/F7) in WB analysis. Weak reactivity of mAb D3/G6 with epitopes present on protein M and nucleoprotein N were detected (Fig. 1). Conformational changes of viral antigens resulted in markedly decreased or even absent reactiveness of mAb B4/F2 in WB analysis. All mAb used reacted specifically with native TGEV strains in IP (Fig. 2) and ELISA tests according to results given in Table 1. Indirect ELISA titres of individual mAbTGEV solutions containing 5 mg Ig/ml ranged between 2 \u00d7 105 and 4 \u00d7 106. Cross reactivity of mAb with other viral antigens (rotavirus A and PEDV) could not be detected by any of methods used. The reactivity of individual mAb with five TGEV strains was checked by CB\u2010ELISA examination of infectious culture media. According to obtained positive NA and %B values, the mAb D7/G7 and B7/F7 react with all TGEV strains, while mAb D3/G6 and B4/F2 react with strains V\u2010344 and Cz\u20101995 only.

We supposed that mAb against N and M antigens of various TGEV strains could be useful for this purpose in spite of their crossreactivity with PRCV. Faecal shedding of PRCV after infection was demonstrated by nested\u2010RT\u2010PCR (Constantini et al., 2004). However, the demonstration of ingested virus cannot be excluded. Little if any enteric multiplication of PRCV was demonstrated by immunofluorescence after experimental infection of 1\u2010week\u2010old piglets only, and it remained limited to a few unidentified cells located in or underneath the epithelial layer of the villi and/or crypts (Cox et al., 1990a, 1990b, 1990c). The RT\u2010PCR is extremely sensitive allowing RNA detection of only occasional viral particles in the sample. Although the sensitivity of TGEV detection by CB\u2010ELISA in faecal samples is sufficient (103 TCID50 TGEV/ml), we suppose that the possibility to demonstrate traces of PRCV is relatively low. Nevertheless, this assumption will be further checked by application of RT\u2010PCR in following experiments.",

While in DAS\u2010ELISA conjugated mAb are used, CB\u2010ELISA method is based on the use of unconjugated mAb. The results obtained also indicate that some faecal samples may be wrongly assessed under constant dilutions of the reaction components. The samples with high concentrations of viral antigen, giving high absorbance values, assessed as negative for %B < 50, are clearly positive under changed dilutions of faeces or SwS. The evaluation of samples with low antigen concentrations and low absorbance values are affected by SwS dilutions as well (2, 3). This was confirmed by examination of 99 field faecal samples; nine of them were TGEV positive. However, high TGEV concentrations, suggesting that the virus is an important causative agent of gastroenteritis, were detected in three samples only. Moreover, in all TGEV\u2010positive samples, the presence of rotavirus A and/or PEDV was demonstrated, indicating the importance of mixed enteric viral infections (results not shown). The demonstration of TGEV antibodies in only one of 81 randomly selected field sow serum samples indicates that the animals produce antibodies if the TGEV antigenic stimulation is high enough to compete with the stimulation by other enteric pathogens. The results also correlate with the assumption that the immunity of sows to PRCV leads to decreased occurrence of TGEV gastroenteritis (Bernard et al., 1989; Lanza et al., 1995; \u0160est\u00e1k et al., 1996).",

It follows, that characteristic structures of coronaviruses are less frequent by EM examination and cellular substructures may imitate \u2018corona\u2010like\u2019 particles.
