The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) advisory against travel to Singapore was lifted on May 4th, 2003 and the alert was terminated on June 4th, 2003.\n1\n There were 205 recovered cases, 33 deaths, and 238 probable cases in Singapore between March and May.\n2\n A number of these were healthcare workers infected with the SARS\u2010associated coronavirus. Apart from SARS infection, healthcare workers were also affected in other ways. Skin disorders were seen as a consequence of the various measures instituted to curb the transmission of SARS. The two patients with acne vulgaris reported here are representative of several seen during and after the SARS period.",

There are several clinical subgroups of acne,\n3\n including tropical acne. This is a well\u2010known entity which occurs in hot and humid climates. It is particularly common in soldiers\n4\n and affects mainly the trunk and buttocks.",

During the SARS period, N95 masks were recommended by the CDC and World Health Organization (WHO) for use when healthcare workers came into contact with confirmed or suspected SARS patients. They provided at least 95% filtration against oil\u2010free particles and needed to be worn tightly against the face to be effective. It was not surprising to see acne occurring in the regions of the face covered by the masks. Donning of these masks over prolonged periods of time creates a humid \u201ctropical\u201d skin microclimate conducive to a flare\u2010up of acne. Alternatively, the flare\u2010up could have been a consequence of simple pilosebaceous duct occlusion due to local pressure on the skin from the close\u2010fitting masks.",

We will no doubt continue to see this condition as long as we need to take precautions to prevent another SARS epidemic.",
