Patients with conditions that would preclude completion of the study were excluded.

The most significant risk factor for severe pneumonia was an age of >60 years (P < .001). In general, no statistically significant association was observed between the pathogen detected and the infected patient's PSI score class. However, M. pneumoniae was predominantly detected in patients in PSI score classes I and II (P = .05). PCR detected significantly more mixed infections in patients in PSI score classes IV and V (P = .002) than did conventional methods, which did not detect any cases of mixed infection in these risk groups. Human rhinovirus and human coronaviruses OC43 and 229E were identified as the only etiologic agents in 4 patients with PSI scores in classes IV and V. Mixed infection in patients with severe pneumonia was significantly associated with the presence of human rhinovirus (P = .001) and human coronaviruses OC43 and 229E (P = .005).",

This higher number was mainly a result of detection of respiratory viruses, especially human rhinovirus and human coronaviruses, that are poorly detected by conventional techniques. Previous studies using conventional methods have achieved a microbiological detection rate of 2.1%\u201375% [10, 19, 20, 22]. The reason for these large differences is the diagnostic tests used; Campbell et al.

PCR and bacterial culture also detected pathogens in >90% of patients with severe pneumonia. Therefore, a microbiological diagnosis could be made for the majority of elderly patients and patients with severe pneumonia by use of PCR, which would also help in the management of such patients. Rello et al. [23] claimed that microbiological diagnosis was fully justified in cases of severe community-acquired pneumonia because it had an impact on patient outcome, but others have found that diagnosis has had no impact [6, 7]. However, PCR provides the opportunity to identify the etiological agent in a clinically relevant time period. This could result in changes to antimicrobial therapy and could allow the potential use of antivirals. The rapid diagnosis of influenza A and B is especially important because the neuramidiase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir are effective if administered within the 48 h of the initial onset of symptoms.",

M. pneumoniae infection has also been described in patients at low risk of pneumonia [19], a finding confirmed in this study, which found M. pneumoniae only in patients in PSI score classes I and II. The incidence of C. pneumoniae infection varies between <1% and 13% [19, 20, 22]. The frequency of Legionella infection in this study (6%) is similar to that in some other studies [19, 20], although rates as high as 15% have been reported as well [26]. Legionella species are regarded as a cause of severe CAP [27]. All cases of Legionella infection occurred in hospitalized patients, and 3 of these cases were in patients in PSI score classes IV and V, and, therefore, could be regarded as severe pneumonia.",

In this study, influenza A virus was also, by all methods, one of the most frequently detected respiratory viral pathogens. Respiratory virus infections accounted for 14% of cases, with conventional microbiological methods, but that rate increased to 56.2% with PCR methods. The results of this study are in agreement with several reports that describe the increased sensitivity and specificity of PCR for respiratory viruses [12, 17, 28] because the use of PCR resulted in more diagnoses of respiratory virus infections than did conventional methods of detection. Each cell line used in cell culture can only detect 1 pathogen, and conventional techniques are very poor for detection of human rhinovirus and human coronavirus, which could explain the difference. PCR has an increased rate of detection of human rhinovirus [29] and human coronavirus [30], which are well recognized as the causes of common cold. There is increasing evidence that they are also important causes of severe lower respiratory disease. Rhinovirus infections have been reported in elderly adults with LRTI or pneumonia [31, 32] and in immunocompromised patients [33, 34]. Human coronavirus infection has also been reported in cases of pneumonia [30, 32, 35, 36]. In 4 cases in this study, human rhinovirus and human coronavirus were identified as sole etiologic agents, suggesting these viruses were the most likely cause of pneumonia in those cases.",

It has also been suggested that dual viral infections, particularly infections with adenovirus and rhinovirus, could enhance the severity of illness [38]. The combinations seen in this study support this possibility, because viral infections were observed in all cases of mixed infection.",

In this study, 24% of cases remained without a diagnosis when PCR was used. This figure could probably be improved if respiratory samples other than throat swab specimens were investigated. Good detection rates have been reported with the use of sputum samples or induced sputum samples [39, 40], and the use of samples from the lower respiratory tract can result in an increased rate of diagnosis [39], but comparative studies using a variety of upper and lower respiratory tract samples still need to be performed. In addition, samples used in this study were frozen and thawed, which can reduce the sensitivity of the PCR. Most of the cases that were left without a diagnosis occurred in the low-risk patient group and among younger patients, suggesting either that there is less pathogen present for detection or that an unidentified organism was present that may cause less severe disease. Respiratory pathogens previously undetected are continuously being discovered; metapneumovirus is an example, and recently, coronavirus NL63 [41, 42] has been described in a child with pneumonia [41]. This coronavirus was not investigated in our patient population, so it may account for some of the unidentified cases.",

A multiplex PCR that uses the same extraction procedures simplifies the test, and the results are available within 1 day, improving the speed of diagnosis for patients. In previous studies, the diagnosis of infection due to atypical pathogens and viruses has relied on serologic testing of convalescent-phase samples [19\u201321]. Serologic testing is only useful for epidemiology because it is too slow to impact clinical management. The application of real-time, multiplex PCR for rapid diagnosis could also have cost benefits and could result in a reduction of rates of antimicrobial resistance, hospital admission, and nosocomial transmission of respiratory viruses.",
