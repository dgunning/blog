            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a fatal respiratory illness that first appeared on the Saudi Arabian Peninsula in mid-2012. It is caused by a novel betacoronavirus , MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [1]. Shortly after the identification of the virus, its receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) was discovered [2]. As of September 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 2468 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS in 27 countries, including 851 associated deaths (fatality rate: ~35%). MERS-CoV does not currently have pandemic potential [3\u20135]. However, MERS-CoV is still epidemic in the Middle East and remains a cause for significant concern due to the potential spread by global travel as demonstrated by the outbreak in South Korea in 2015 [6\u20138].",

            "text": "To date, there are only two published reports on autopsy findings from subjects who died from MERS [9, 10] and our understanding of MERS-CoV pathogenesis in humans is still limited. Animal models are useful for the study of viral diseases and play an important role in the investigation of pathogenesis and evaluation of antiviral therapies and vaccines. An ideal animal model should be permissive to the viral infection and develop disease and pathology with similarities to that observed in humans. MERS-CoV infection has been evaluated in two nonhuman primate (NHP) models, the rhesus macaque and common marmoset [11\u201315]. Both species are susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. However, MERS-CoV caused only a transient lower respiratory tract infection without mortality in rhesus macaques [11\u201313]. In common marmosets, the consequences of MERS-CoV infection are controversial. Falzarano et al. reported the common marmoset reproduced several features of MERS-CoV infection in humans including progressive severe pneumonia [15], while another group observed only mild to moderate nonlethal respiratory disease following MERS-CoV infection [14]. Thus, the common marmoset is potentially a model to study pathogenesis and evaluate antiviral therapies and vaccines. However, NHPs are expensive, their availability limited, and their use may raise ethical concerns. In contrast, small animal models provide advantages over NHPs, including reduced cost, availability in large numbers, ease of handling, and species-specific reagents, especially for the studies of highly pathogenic viruses like MERS-CoV in the Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) laboratory. Unfortunately, common small laboratory animals like mice [16, 17], ferrets [18], guinea pigs [19], and hamsters [20] are not susceptible to MERS-CoV infection because their homologous DPP4 cannot be bound and utilized by MERS-CoV as a host receptor for entry [21, 22]. Haagmans et al. detected MERS-CoV RNA in the respiratory tract of New Zealand white rabbits following inoculation but found no clinical signs of disease [23].",

            "text": "Several strategies have been used to overcome this receptor incompatibility and develop mouse models of MERS-CoV infection. In 2014, we developed the first mouse model of MERS-CoV infection [24]. We delivered a recombinant adenovirus 5 encoding human DPP4 ( hDPP4) to the lungs of mice. Transient expression of hDPP4 by adenovirus transduction made the mice temporarily permissive for MERS-CoV infection, but animals developed only mild lung disease. Generation of transgenic mice expressing a virus receptor is a common strategy to make mice permissive to infection. Several groups in addition to ours developed mice with transgenic expression of hDPP4 using different promoters [25\u201328]. The disease severity following MERS-CoV infection in transgenic mice correlated with the cellular distribution and expression level of hDPP4. In transgenic mice expressing hDPP4 driven by the cytokeratin 18 promoter [26] or a ubiquitous promoter [25, 27, 28], MERS-CoV replicates and causes respiratory disease and mortality. However, the lethality was found to be secondary to overwhelming central nervous system (CNS) disease or multiorgan damage. This was also observed in mice transgenic for human ACE2 driven by the cytokeratin 18 promoter and infected with SARS-CoV [29]. In transgenic mice expressing hDPP4 under the human surfactant protein C (SPC) promoter, which restricts expression to bronchiolar and alveolar epithelia, MERS-CoV infection caused only mild disease [26]. Thus, these transgenic mice do not reproduce a severe lung disease phenotype that resembles MERS.",

Pascal et al. reported a model in which all of the mouse Dpp4 exons had been humanized and also generated humanized monoclonal antibodies against the MERS-CoV S protein using a novel strategy [30]. MERS-CoV infection in this model caused pulmonary edema, vascular cuffing, and alveolar septal thickening with an associated ~20% weight loss, necessitating euthanasia [31]. Another MERS mouse model was engineered by changing two amino acids in the mouse Dpp4 locus using CRISPR-Cas9 technology [32]. This model supported MERS-CoV replication without severe disease. Similarly, our human DPP4 knock-in mouse model supported MERS-CoV replication but did not lead to a severe lung disease phenotype [33]. Two mouse-adapted (MA) strains of MERS-CoV were subsequently developed independently by serial passage of the HCoV-EMC/2012 strain [1] in the lungs of the two humanized mouse models [32, 33]. The resultant MERS-15 and MERSMA6.1.2 mouse-adapted MERS-CoV strains replicated to high titers in the lungs of the CRISPR-Cas9 genetically engineered mouse model and the hDPP4 knock-in mouse model, respectively. The respiratory disease that developed in both mouse models and the associated mortality shared similarities with severe cases of MERS [32, 33]. Mouse adaptation was also successfully used to generate several SARS-CoV strains capable of modeling severe SARS-CoV lung disease in mice [34\u201336]. Thus, the adaption of the virus to enhance virulence in the mouse is a very useful approach to generate mouse models for coronavirus-associated lung disease.",

Keep the dilutions on ice.Remove the medium from each well and add diluted samples (in a volume of 400 \u03bcL) to each well.Place the plates in the 37 \u00b0C incubator for 1 h and rotate gently every 15 min.Melt 2% low melting point agarose and maintain in a 65 \u00b0C water bath.Mix overlay media and 2% low melting point agarose at a volume ratio of 1:1. Rotate the tube several times to fully mix. Overlay cells with 1.5 mL of mixed media using 10 mL stripettes.Let the plates sit in the hood for ~5 min at RT or until the agarose overlay turns solid. Add 0.5 mL D2 medium on the top of solidified agarose.Place the plates in the 37 \u00b0C incubator.After 3 days, plaques should be visible. Remove the liquid on the top of the agarose. Circle the visible plaques on the underside of the plates using a permanent marker (see\nNote 16).Vertically penetrate the agarose and pipette the circled plaque several times with a 1 mL graduated transfer pipette. The agarose above the plaque will be pulled into the pipette.Transfer the agarose above the plaque into a 15 mL conical tube filled with 500 \u03bcL DMEM by pipetting up and down several times.Transfer the 500 \u03bcL DMEM containing the agarose into a 2.0 mL sterile screw-top tube with O-ring cap.Repeat the procedure and pick six single plaques. Store the tubes at \u221280 \u00b0 C.Thaw the tubes containing the isolated plaques on ice.Propagate viruses from the isolated plaques in Huh7 cells (see\nNote 17). To do this, plate Huh7 cells in D10 media in a 6-well plate one day before infection. Remove medium and add 500 \u03bcL of DMEM containing the agarose into the well.

Harvest cell lysate and store at \u221280 \u00b0 C.Titrate the serially passaged viruses by plaque assay on Vero81 cells. Briefly, Vero81 cells are plated in a 12-well plate. On the next day, thaw the virus and serially dilute the virus by tenfold for at least three dilutions with serum-free medium. Remove medium from the wells (Vero81 plate) and add 250 \u03bcL of diluted virus into each well of the plate. Incubate the plate at 37 \u00b0C incubator for 1 h and with gentle rotations of the plate every 15 min to prevent drying of cells. In the meantime, melt 2% low melting point agarose and maintain it in a 65 \u00b0C water bath. After 1 h of incubation, remove the 250 \u03bcL inoculum and overlay cells with 1 mL of 1:1 mix of 2\u00d7 DMEM and 2% low melting point agarose. After the agar overlay turns solid, add two drops of 2% FBS DMEM medium on the top of the solid agar by 10 mL stripettes. The plate should be incubated at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 for about 3 days. After 3 days, fix the wells by adding 25% formaldehyde to completely fill the wells for 20 min. Then aspirate the liquid from each well and remove the agarose. Stain the wells with 0.1% crystal violet to delineate plaques. Remove the crystal violet, rinse wells with DPBS, and count plaques in the hood.Evaluate the virulence of the plaque-isolated virus by monitoring weight loss and survival in mice after intranasal infection with 105 pfu/mouse as mentioned above.Characterize virus distribution by titrating virus load in various organ homogenates and virus genomic RNA abundance in tissues using qRT-PCR.Characterize lung histology after infection.Use next-generation sequencing to identify changes in the MERS-CoV genome sequence following serial passage [33].",

The rate of thawing will depend on the volume (approximately 2 min or until ice crystals melt).Always keep freshly thawed virus aliquots or dilutions on ice. This makes the virus more stable and leads to more reproducible results.Check that mice are fully anesthetized by observing the pedal reflex. If mice are not fully anesthetized, they may move excessively or sneeze when virus is applied.While holding mice, make sure no pressure is applied over the throat area to avoid interference with respiration.Do not place the pipette tip inside the nostril. If a mouse does not inhale the droplet, stop pipetting, and wait until the mouse inhales what is already applied.Monitor the health of mice before returning to the cage.Record weights from the day of infection until recovery.Animal euthanasia should follow the institution\u2019s Animal Care and Use guidelines. There may be differences in institutional requirements regarding when euthanasia is required based on weight loss.Use the lid of an insulated foam shipping box. Cut absorbent bench underpad (42 \u00d7 58 cm) into small pieces that fit the lid.Carefully keep the tip of the needle in the lumen of the ventricle. Be sure to puncture the right atrium as this will help to drain blood during the perfusion. The lung will turn white after perfusion.Make sure that the incision does not exceed the thickness of the skull; avoid cutting into the brain tissue.The individual organs can be divided into pieces and transferred to grinders with PBS or TRIzol separately.Lung homogenates are immediately transferred to tubes on ice. RNA samples are transferred to a tube and incubated for at least 15 min at room temperature per our BSL-3 specific standard operating procedures.At 2 days post infection with 105 pfu/mouse, HCoV-EMC/2012 strain replicates in the lung of the hDPP4 KI mice to a titer of around 4 \u00d7 106 pfu/mL, which equals 2 \u00d7 105 pfu in 50 \u03bcL. We chose the 105 pfu/mouse inoculum to begin because we wanted to use a similar dose range during in vivo serial passage while skipping the titration step.Titrate the homogenates of the passage of interest and select a virus dilution that produces \u226410 plaques in a well. This allows identification of individual clear single plaques.Only circle the unambiguous clear single plaques.Compared to Vero 81 cells, we found that the MERS-CoV RNA genome is more stable when propagated in Huh7 cells (less likely to introduce genomic deletions, insertions, or point mutations).\n",
