The primary symptoms may last up to 14days after exposure, and the incubation period ranges 9-12days. Untreated disease may result in alveolar damage and pneumonia, mostly culminating in organ failure and death. The major route of interpersonaltransmission is through temporal and physical close contact with patients (by aerosols through sneezing or coughing).This was confirmed when some nurses who cared forhospitalized patients were found positive,while having no history of visiting the seafood markets at Wuhan[2], the origin of the pandemic. Before strict quarantine measures were implemented in Wuhan, positive cases were rationally thought to originate afterhuman-human transmission, instead of zoonotic transmission, in densely populated markets. However, the exact means of viral transmission is stillnot fully understood [3] , especially in the initial cases. Indeed, investigation of the naturalbackground of the virus as a putative zoonotic disease is important for preventing future outbreaks.",

            "text": "Besides hospitalized or confirmed cases, many asymptomatic individuals potentially carry the virus. Thus, diagnosing the patients and finding the asymptomatic carriers will help us understand the exact viral transmission routes.Simulation studies can mathematically modelthe contribution of the asymptomatic carriers in person-person viral transmission [4] , highlighting thatfulminating cases are unlikely to be the only viral sources. Reportedly, the viral load in an asymptomatic carrier is akin to that in a symptomatic patient; thus, asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patientsare likelyto transmit the virus as well as symptomatic patients. They could likely freely shed the virus into the environment,potentially boosting the transmission cycle as an unintentional, but dangerous, viral source. Asymptomatic carriers are thus likely to participate, more than symptomatic cases, in mass-gatherings, sporting events, shopping, and going to schools or gyms. The asymptomatic carriers may have been rapidly spreading the virus within, and to, many different countries.We postulate that the increase in the number of affected countries 10-20 days after the initial reports of the outbreak may have been partially facilitated by the asymptomatic carriers. Crowd masking has been suggested to prevent the transmission of the virus to healthy uninfected people,and this could also prevent the asymptomatic carriers from shedding the virus. On 2 March 2020, an expert WHO team travelled to Tehran and aimed to investigate the viral transmission dynamics and at-risk populations. Such surveys help grow our experience on how to control COVID-19 globally. Recently, China, Bahrain, Jordan, the United States, Afghanistan, Italy, Australia, and South Korea temporarily closed their borders to decrease the viral spread. Nevertheless, cohesive guidelines on how to manage the asymptomatic carriers are lacking. Local screening and surveillance of the asymptomatic carriers by simple PCR-based assayscould be effective in managing the viral transmission by the carriers. A limitation of sampling could be that oropharyngeal or nasopharyngealswabs may fail to result in confirmatory diagnosis of an asymptomatic carrier, and deeper sampling of the respiratory tract may be necessary.",

No confirmatory or contradictory reports on the case-fatality rate or revised incubation period of COVID-19 have emerged from the involved countries, including North America, Europe, Australia, and Africa.Thus, our understanding of pathogenesis, transmission, carriers, virus shedding,and incubation period of COVID-19 and its complex interaction with the host immune system is mostly incomplete. We acknowledge that the highest priority by the world decisionmakers is to defeat the pandemic,but concurrently, intervening with, and screening the asymptomatic carriers should be considered worldwide before a second large wave of positive cases emerges.The lessons learned from the present COVID-19 pandemic are that 1) robust research endeavors are required to change our mindset about emerging pathogens; and 2) surveillance and screening systems should be recruited for monitoring the less-known viral or bacterial pathogens.",
