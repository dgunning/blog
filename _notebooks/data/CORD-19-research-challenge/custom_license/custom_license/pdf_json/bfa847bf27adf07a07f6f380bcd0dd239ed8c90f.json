Patients (41 out of 74, 55.4%) were defined as fecal sample positive because the SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detected by real-time PCR for at least one time. The diagnosis of real-time RT-PCR were performed in both our hospital and the local CDC. The majority of Real-time RT-PCR results shown in this study were performed in our hospital, while respiratory tract samples of suspected cases were required to be further tested in local CDC for official confirmation. The real-time RT-PCR was only performed to feces specimens after Feb 2 nd in our hospital, so we don't know the status of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in patient before Feb 2 nd for most patients.",

The Real-time RT-PCR performed in The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University was using the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real Time RT-PCR kit from LifeRiver Ltd. (Catalog #: RR-0479-02). Nucleocapsid gene (N), membrane gene (E) and RNA dependent RNA polymerase gene (RdRp) were the three targeted genes simultaneously amplified and tested. Detailed protocol is described at the website (1). The diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia performed in local CDC was based on the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (6th edition) published by the National Health Commission of China (2). All reagents and protocols used are CFDA approved.",

Our data suggest that patients no positivity for fecal viral RNA may be attributed to relative low expression of ACE2 in their intestinal tract, which needs to be experimental validated.
