            "text": "Community respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, and picornaviruses, are an important cause of respiratory disease in the immunocompromised adult with cancer. Recent studies have demonstrated that a minimum of 31% of adult bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients and 18% of adults with leukemia who are hospitalized with an acute respiratory illness have a community respiratory virus infection. The temporal occurrence of these infections in immunocompromised patients tends to mirror their occurrence in the community. The clinical illnesses range from self-limited upper respiratory illnesses to fatal pneumonias, depending on the type of virus and the type and degree of immunosuppression. The pneumonias may be viral, bacterial/fungal, or mixed. The highest frequency of progression to fatal viral pneumonia has been reported for RSV infections in recently transplanted BMT recipients and myelosuppressed patients with leukemia. Studies have suggested that early therapy for RSV pneumonia with a combination of aerosolized ribavirin and intravenous immunoglobulin may be of benefit. Defining effective prophylactic and therapeutic strategies will be a challenge, given the diversity of viruses, the wide spectrum of immunocompromised patients with varying vulnerability to serious community respiratory virus disease, and the frequent presence of other opportunistic infections and medical problems. A combination of antiviral drugs and immunotherapy may need to be considered for their potential additive effect as well as to prevent the emergence of resistant virus, as occurs during monotherapy for influenza with amantadine or rimantadine. The optimal therapies need to be defined in controlled trials; however, it appears that a favorable response will hinge on the initiation of therapy at an early stage of the respiratory illness.",

These infections were due to RSV (49%), influenza viruses (18%), picornaviruses (18%), parainfluenza viruses (9%), and adenoviruses (6%). The different viruses were intermingled through these two wintertime periods, as in the community. During the intervening warmer months, RSV and in- fluenza disappeared from our hospital as from the community. The patients with community respiratory virus infections were young to middle-aged adults, an age group in which these viruses would typically cause relatively benign, self-limited illnesses. These infections were acquired by autologous (n \u00c5 32) as well as allogeneic (n \u00c5 35) transplant recipients, and by pre-engrafted (n \u00c5 28) as well as post-engrafted (n \u00c5 39) patients. However, the severity of some of the infections, particularly RSV, was temporally related to the time after transplant, with more severe infections tending to occur more frequently during the early post-transplant period. During these early years of the surveillance study, 32 (48%) infections were acquired nosocomially. The number of nosocomial infections has since declined considerably through an aggressive multifaceted infection-control strategy. 37 Only one infection was acquired in the protected environment, confirming that these infections did not primarily reflect reactivation of latent virus, as in the case of the herpesviruses, but were acquired exogenously.",

The mortality rate was 31% among patients with pneumonia in whom combination therapy was initiated \u00fa24 hours prior to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation (n \u00c5 13). In contrast, the mortality rate was 100% among patients who were treated after the onset of respiratory failure (n \u00c5 5), patients who were not treated (n \u00c5 4), and the one patient treated with high-dose short-duration aerosolized ribavirin. 45, 46 Some centers have tried other treatment regimens with varying success, including combination aerosolized and intravenous ribavirin. 47 The relative ease of administration of intravenous ribavirin is attractive. However, in a recent trial, the mortality rate was 80% among 10 BMT recipients with RSV pneumonia treated with intravenous ribavirin. 32 The dose of ribavirin used in this study was considerably lower than that used to treat hemorrhagic fevers, raising the question of whether a higher dose might be of benefit at an earlier stage of the respiratory illness. 48, 49 Since the response to therapy will vary considerably depending on the stage of the respiratory illness as well as the type, degree, and duration of underlying immunodeficiency, the optimal therapy will need to be defined in controlled trials. The risk of pneumonia and death was closely related to the time after transplant (Table III) . During these 3 years, RSV infection was documented by viral culture or autopsy in 46 adult BMT recipients (38 inpatients and 8 outpatients).

Because of the high overall mortality rate with viral pneumonia (61% for RSV pneumonia and 79% for CMV pneumonia), the approach to RSV disease will probably need to be modeled after the strategies that have been worked out for CMV disease, namely, prophylaxis or preemptive therapy at an early stage of the viral illness.

The other 2 patients on whom autopsies were performed had bacterial and/ or fungal pneumonia. Although influenza has been studied globally for decades, there are no guidelines for the treatment of influenza pneumonia and it is not known whether amantadine/rimantadine can prevent the progression of uncomplicated influenza to pneumonia in an immunocompromised patient. Studies have suggested that amantadine/rimantadine and/or ribavirin (aerosolized or intravenous) may be of benefit. [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] In our study, many patients were treated with amantadine/rimantadine and a few patients also received ribavirin. However, this was not done in a systematic manner (in part because of an inability to diagnose these illnesses in a timely manner), and the efficacy of therapy could not be evaluated. Nevertheless, several important findings emerged. Similar to viral pneumonias caused by RSV and CMV, antiviral therapy was not of benefit if it was initiated after the onset of respiratory failure. Also, similar to immunocompetent patients, a significant proportion of immunocompromised patients treated with amantadine/rimantadine alone developed resistant strains of virus, suggesting that amantadine/rimantadine alone may not be an option for the therapy of influenza A in these patients. [71] [72] [73] [74] Effective therapeutic regimens for influenza virus pneumonia need to be established for immunocompetent as well as immunocompromised patients. A combination of antiviral drugs (such as rimantadine, ribavirin, and/or neuraminidase inhibitors) needs to be investigated, as well as the potential additive benefit of immunotherapy. 75, 76 There have been other reports of influenza in immunocompromised adults that have not documented such a high frequency of pulmonary complications and death. 2, 7, 18 This wide spectrum of observations probably reflects the wide spectrum of immunocompromised patients being studied. The morbidity and mortality of influenza, as well as the other community respiratory viruses, appear to be related to the type, degree, and duration of immunosuppression. In less immunocompromised patients, the clinical course of influenza may be more comparable to that in immunocompetent persons. It is also noteworthy that, unlike RSV, influenza viruses undergo frequent antigenic variation and prevalent types and serotypes vary, so the morbidity and mortality may be expected to vary from year to year.",

            "text": "Because of the large number of patients who are seriously ill with these diseases, effective prophylactic and therapeutic regimens need to be defined. This will be a challenge, since there is a wide diversity of viruses, each of which needs to be approached individually, and there is a wide range of immunocompromised patients with varying vulnerability to seri-ous community respiratory virus disease. Even within a particular subset of patients, such as leukemia patients and BMT recipients, there is a wide range of vulnerability to serious disease that is often in a state of flux, reflecting their worsening or improving immunodeficiency. Further confounding the clinical picture is the frequent presence of other serious opportunistic infections and medical problems. To conduct the controlled trials needed to define effective prophylactic and therapeutic regimens, many of these complex problems will need to be addressed collaboratively by the multiple medical centers caring for these patients.",
