Various infectious agents can be transmitted from patients to HCWs and vice versa (Weber et al., 2010) . As droplet transmission is a major mode of transmission of some pathogens, standard infection control measures like hand washing alone may not be enough to prevent HCW transmission or outbreaks. HCWs can transmit infections such as tuberculosis, varicella, and influenza by the airborne route (Weber et al., 2010) ; it is less well appreciated that airborne and other routes of transmission of certain bacterial pathogens may occur.",

In addition, antibiotic resistant bacteria are a very significant problem facing hospitals, and HCWs play a role in their transmission. Bacterial respiratory tract infections are generally not considered a major occupational problem for HCWs. A growing body of evidence suggests that the risk of bacterial respiratory infections is increased by co-infection with viruses and vice-versa, and this has been studied mostly around the relationship between influenza and pneumococcus (Klugman et al., 2009; Madhi and Klugman, 2004; MMWR, 2009; Zhou et al., 2012) . Bacterial load in the nasopharynx is also thought to be related to risk of invasive disease or bacterial-viral co-infection (Klugman et al., 2009) . A meta-analysis showed frequent bacterial co-infections during influenza outbreaks . Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus spp. and other Streptococcus spp. are the commoner causes of bacterial secondary infection following an influenza-like illness (ILI) .",

Further, HCWs with invasive pneumococcal disease may go unreported in the occupational context (Sherertz et al., 2001) . On the other hand, Bordetella pertussis outbreaks among HCWs have been widely reported (Addiss et al., 1991; Gehanno et al., 1999; Pascual et al., 2006) , with such outbreaks attributed to airborne transmission through droplets . In another study, evidence of acute infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae was detected in 2% of HCWs (Hyman et al., 1995) . Outbreaks of Mycoplasma pneumoniae among HCWs have been observed in Finland, where 44% (n = 97) of HCWs tested positive for the pathogen without detectable M. pneumoniae-specific antibody, suggesting acute infection (Kleemola and Jokinen, 1992) . Legionella has also been described as an occupational risk factor for HCWs (Borella et al., 2008; Rudbeck et al., 2009) . In contrast to these outbreaks, there are few prospective studies of bacterial respiratory infections or colonization and the clinical implications for HCWs.",

Of note, MMs have not been shown to clearly provide respiratory protection in the community or HCW setting (Aiello et al., 2012; Cowling et al., 2009; MacIntyre et al., 2009 MacIntyre et al., , 2011 . This may be attributed to lower filtration efficiency and poorer fit than respirators which, in contrast, are specifically designed to provide respiratory protection (Balazy et al., 2006; Lawrence et al., 2006; Weber et al., 1993) . We have previously shown that a N95 respirator provides significantly better protection against clinical respiratory infection than medical masks in HCWs (MacIntyre et al., 2011 (MacIntyre et al., , 2013 . Although our previous work tested clinical efficacy in preventing infection, the relative importance of different routes of transmission (airborne, aerosol, and direct hand-to-mouth contact) in the clinical efficacy of respiratory protection is unknown. That is, a mask may provide protection against more than one mode of transmission. The only bacterial infection for which respirators are considered and recommended for HCWs is tuberculosis (Chen et al., 1994; Nicas, 1995) . In this study, our aim was to determine the efficacy of respiratory protection in preventing bacterial colonization and co-infections or co-colonization in HCWs.",

Our findings suggest that bacterial respiratory tract colonization or infection in HCWs should be studied further. Bacterial colonization may be a precursor to viral and bacterial co-infections and invasive bacterial infections in individuals with influenza or other respiratory viral infections. It is possible that the onset of upper respiratory tract bacterial colonization may itself cause mild respiratory tract symptoms, given that only symptomatic HCWs were swabbed in our study. This requires further investigation, in particular comparison with an asymptomatic HCW group. We believe that these results may have occupational health implications for HCWs, given the body of evidence that supports a complex, synergistic and poorly understood pathogenic relationship between bacterial and viral respiratory infection (Klugman et al., 2009; Madhi and Klugman, 2004; MMWR, 2009; Zhou et al., 2012) . The finding that bacterial colonization and co-infections were a greater risk on respiratory wards than other clinical settings also supports the fact that occupational transmission is occurring in HCWs. Interestingly, smoking was not a risk factor for colonization or co-infection. We also found that nurses had significantly higher rate of bacterial co-infection than doctors. This may be due to higher patient contact or differences in use of infection control measures and personal protection (Chan, 2010; Chan et al., 2002) .",

The significant protection against this afforded by N95 respirators mirrors the same trend seen in our previous study for clinical outcomes (MacIntyre et al., 2011 outcomes (MacIntyre et al., , 2013 . Outbreaks of bacterial respiratory infection do occur in HCWs (Kleemola and Jokinen, 1992; Ong et al., 2006; Pascual et al., 2006) . Therefore, the observed reduction in bacterial colonization may translate to clinical protection against infection. S. pneumoniae was the most common bacteria identified in the upper respiratory tract. Invasive pneumococcal disease is thought to occur shortly after acquisition of colonization (Boulnois, 1992; Gray et al., 1980) , and the infection can be transmitted by a colonized, asymptomatic individual. The rate of pneumococcal colonization demonstrated in our study was 6% (30/481 in controls), which is within the range described in adults (who have lower rates of colonization than children) (Austrian, 1986; Kadioglu et al., 2008; Obaro et al., 1996; Ridda et al., 2011) . In an earlier study of frail elderly adults, only 1/315 subjects carried S. pneumonia (Ridda et al., 2011) , although rates of adult carriage in the pre-vaccine era of up to 28% have been described (Hammitt et al., 2006) . Bacterial load in the nasopharynx, not measured in this study, may be important in predicting the risk of invasive disease or viral co-infection and warrants further study (Klugman et al., 2009) . We demonstrated that N95 respirators prevent carriage with S. pneumoniae. Although S. pneumoniae is not typically associated with outbreaks, nosocomial transmission and invasive disease in hospital patients from a carrier HCW have been reported (Guillet et al., 2012) . In addition, transmission of bacterial pathogens from patients to HCWs during high-risk procedures has been described (Baba et al., 2009 ).",

We have shown that all combinations of coinfection or co-colonization, with bacteria, viruses and both bacteria and virus, occur in symptomatic HCWs. These co-infections also display the same trend of decreasing frequency with increasing respiratory protection. Whatever their clinical significance, co-infection can be reduced by respiratory protection, and this may have implications for both patient safety, control of outbreaks and occupational health and safety of HCWs in hospitals. Co-infections, particularly bacterial-viral coinfection and dual viral infections can be more clearly implicated in causing disease in HCWs than colonization with a single bacterial species. This aspect of our findings, as well as the increased risk for staff in respiratory wards, therefore, has more direct clinical implications.",

This finding, while not reaching statistical significance, may be due to chance, but is concerning and should certainly be investigated further. It is possible that the physical conditions of a medical mask may increase moisture or other parameters to increase risk of coinfection.",

Quantitative data on bacterial load would also have strengthened the study. Finally, the mechanisms of protection of a mask against respiratory tract colonization may be multi-modal. A mask may protect against respiratory transmission of pathogens, but may also act as a barrier to reduce hand to nose or hand to face contact, and may reduce infection in this way. Barrier precautions have been shown to reduce the rate of nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization (Safdar et al., 2006) , so it would be expected that the barrier provided by a mask may have the same effect. A limitation of this study is that we cannot differentiate the relative contributions of prevention of airborne, droplet or direct contact transmission, but the study provided clinical efficacy estimates regardless of the different potential mechanisms of protection. If masks act by preventing multiple modes of transmission, they could have utility in preventing multidrugresistant bacteria colonization of the nasopharynx of HCWs. Organisms such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) are a serious hospital infection control problem for HCWs (Morgan et al., 2012) . Rates of clinical infections in HCWs with MRSA of 5.1% have been described, as has transmission of MRSA from HCWs to patients (Elie-Turenne et al., 2010; Sherertz et al., 2001; Verwer et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2011) . A future research question could be the role of masks in preventing MRSA colonization in HCWs.",

The risk of such colonization is higher in ward types where more respiratory infections are expected (such as respiratory wards). The documented nosocomial outbreaks of bacterial infections such as pertussis and even S. pneumoniae in HCWs (Guillet et al., 2012; Pascual et al., 2006) , as well as the efficacy against co-infections suggest there may be occupational safety benefits to HCWs in high-risk settings using a respirator, and that more studies are needed to better understand potential bacterial nosocomial respiratory pathogens.",
