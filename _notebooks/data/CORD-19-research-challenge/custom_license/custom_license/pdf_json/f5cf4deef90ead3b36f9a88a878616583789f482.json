In January 2020, a novel enveloped RNA coronavirus was identified as the cause, and by January 7, 2020, it was named by the World Health Organization (WHO) as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). By early-April 2020, the virus has spread widely across the world with over 1.5 million confirmed cases, which are increasing daily. The WHO has declared a public health emergency. 1 Despite worldwide spread, the epidemiological and clinical patterns of 2019-nCoV among children were initially unclear. Recently, public health officials announced the first death of an infant with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Cook County, Illinois, making identification of the features of COVID-19 in children of paramount importance. As such, we wish to present the findings of the largest retrospective study thus far of epidemiologic characteristics of 2143 pediatric patients with COVID-19. 2 ",

It is additionally unclear if suspected patients had negative testing, or if suspected patients were not tested because of limitations in testing supplies, or testing abilities in the pediatric population.

In addition, patients with more moderate findings may warrant a more extensive laboratory workup. Current CDC guidelines suggest testing only if having a risk factor plus clinical features, typically cough, lower respiratory symptoms, and fever. Consideration may be given to enhanced pediatric testing, as many infected children may be unidentified carriers, thus spreading the disease throughout the community.",
