Currently, this is not the case anywhere in the world. In China, where 129 the outbreak started, the body overseeing the prevention and control of the epidemic (the 130 National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China) has issued a series of 131 prevention and control guidelines. As of 12 March 2020, the guidelines have been 132 updated six times 133 (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/jkj/s3577/202003/4856d5b0458141fa9f376853224d41d7.shtml), 134 reflecting some change in the Commission's perception of the mechanisms of the viral 135 infection spread: from no mention of airborne transmission at all to an admission of the 136 possibility of this route of transmission. However, the guidelines stopped short of 138 2020) that airborne transmission \"has not been determined\". In Italy, which has emerged 139 as one of the main hot spots in the world, the distance of 1 meter between people is 140 recommended in indoor \"red zones\", but there is no mention of longer distance transport 141 (Gazzetta Ufficiale 2020). The list of examples could go on. The US Centers for Disease 142 Control and Prevention (CDC Page last reviewed: October 30, 2018) takes a broader 143 view of viral infection spread, stating that: \"Airborne transmission over longer distances, 144 such as from one patient room to another has not been documented and is thought not to 145 occur\". At the time of writing, the daily increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 in 146 the USA is fast (WHO et al. 2020). 147 It is difficult to explain why public health authorities marginalize the significance of 148 airborne transmission of influenza or coronaviruses, but a possible reason is that it is 149 difficult to directly detect the viruses traveling in the air. Immediately after expiration, the 150 plume carrying the expired viral content is diluted, and as it travels in the air carried by 151 the air flow. In the process, the concentration of the virus does not increase uniformly in 152 the interior environment of the enclosed space, but it is elevated only in the flow (if there 153 is adequate ventilation, which is normally the case in medical facilities or on aircraft) 154 (Morawska 2006). Therefore, sampling for the presence of the virus requires knowledge 155 of the air flow from the infected person, and a sufficiently long sampling period to collect 156 enough copies of the viruses. Both these requirements present major challenges: 157 microbiologists collecting viral samples are not normally experts in building flow 158 dynamics, and practicality prevents long sampling times that would be adequate for the 159 sensitivity of existing viral detection methods (Booth et al. 2005). 160 The fact that there are no simple methods for detecting the virus in the air does not mean 161 that the viruses do not travel in the air. The above-mentioned retrospective modeling 162 studies explained the transmission of SARS-CoV-1 in 2003 (Booth et al. 2005; Li et al. 163 2005; Olsen et al. 2003; Xiao et al. 2017; Yu et al. 2005). While we do not yet have all 164 the required data in hand, including for example data on the patterns of infections, or 165 specific indoor characteristics where the infections occurred, analysis of the initial pattern 166 of COVID-19 spread in China reveals multiple cases of non-contact transmission, 167 especially in areas outside Wuhan, such as those in Hunan and Tianjin. On numerous 169 occurred after the imposition of isolation that confined passengers for the majority of 170 time to their cabins, and limited direct contact, and with hand hygiene carefully obeyed. 171 Was it therefore the ventilation system that spread the airborne virus between the cabins 172 one of the reasons for the infections? There are also hypothesis, that airborne 173 transmission was at least partially responsible for a larger number of infections during a 174 choir, where 45 out of 60 choir members were infected (Read 2020). 175 Despite the evidence and strong hypotheses, the world appears to be locked in the old 176 way of thinking that only direct contact matters in viral infection spread. It is 177 disconcerting that with all the experience and evidence currently available, when faced 178 with a new viral outbreak of COVID-19, the authorities still fail to acknowledge the 179 airborne pathway of transmission, although many experts in China and other countries 180 have had experience in dealing with SARS. 181 We predict that this failure to immediately recognize and acknowledge the importance of 182 airborne transmission and to take adequate actions against it will result in additional cases 183 of infection in the coming weeks and months, which would not occur if these actions 184 were taken. The air transmission issue should be taken seriously now, during the course 185 of the epidemic. When the epidemic is over and retrospective data demonstrates the 186 importance of airborne transmission it will be too late. Further, the lessons learnt now187 will prepare us better for when the next epidemic strikes.",
