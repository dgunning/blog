Viral nucleic acid test by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the first line screening method of choice [3] . However, the sensitivity of RT-PCR is insufficient, ranging from 50-62% according to previous large-scale reports [4, 5] . Some patients may be highly suspicious, based on established close contact with confirmed cases, typical clinical manifestations and CT image appearance, but may still develop a false negative initial RT-PCR, which increases the risk of community transmission and delay in treatment. Nonetheless, RT-PCR remains the gold standard tool for confirming COVID-19 infection, incorporating multiple RT-PCR tests to make up for its shortcomings.",

Recent studies showed CT of COVID had typical appearance of viral lung infection, with a sensitivity of 60-98% [8, 9] . Notably, CT changes may be identified before patients become symptomatic and RT-PCR positive [10] [11] [12] . In Hubei, there was a temporary period where diagnoses of COVID-19 were based on CT changes even without positive PT-PCR result to ensure timely treatment and isolation measures. On the contrary, no CT abnormality was found in part of the confirmed cases when pneumonia was absent. Other kinds of viral pneumonia can also mimic COVID-19 pneumonia, which makes it difficult to differentiate. Few studies include non COVID-19 patients as control in the analysis. Moreover, most of the study results are from Wuhan or Hubei patients, which may potentially cause over estimation by enrolling more severe cases. Thus, the diagnostic performance of CT in COVID-19 is less clarified.",
