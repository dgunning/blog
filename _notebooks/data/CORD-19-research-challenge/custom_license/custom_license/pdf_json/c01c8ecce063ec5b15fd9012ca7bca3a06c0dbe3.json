Highlights \uf09f Do not ignore patients without certain exposure history. \uf09f Pay attention to identifying asymptomatic infected patients. \uf09f Certain laboratory inspection may contribute to the judgment of the severity of illness. \uf09f There is no specific treatment to COVID-19 infection currently. Abstract Objective: To investigate the epidemiological and clinical features of patients with COVID-19 in Anhui province of China. Method: In this descriptive study, we obtained epidemiological, demographic, manifestations, laboratory data and radiological findings of patients confirmed by real-time RT-PCR in the NO.2 Results: Of 125 patients infected SARS-CoV-2, the mean age was 38.76 years (SD, 13.799) and 71(56.8%) were male. Common symptoms include fever [116 (92.8%)], cough [102(81.6%)], and shortness of breath [57(45.6%)]. Lymphocytopenia developed in 48(38.4%) patients. 100(80.0%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 26(20.8%) patients showed multiple mottling and groundglass opacity. All patients were given antiviral therapy. 19(15.2%) patients were transferred to the intensive care unit. By February 18, 47(37.6%) patients were discharged and none of patients died.",

Several days after, similar patients appeared in other cities of China, most of whom had a history of exposure to Wuhan within 14 days. On Jan 22, Anhui province confirmed first case of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (NCP). The number of confirmed cases grew rapidly. Anhui province, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f which borders Hubei province, is also a major province for migrant workers, many of whom work in Wuhan and other provinces in Hubei. As Chinese Spring Festival drawing near, 4.3 million people travelled out of Wuhan to other cities in China between 11 January and 23 January (Tian et al.,2020) , a lot of whom were migrant workers and college students returned from Wuhan. It provided a shortcut for the virus spreading. On February 7, 2020, National Health Commission of the People's Republic China temporarily named the pneumonia infected by the new coronavirus as Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia(General Office of National Health Commission,2020). On February 11,2020, World Health Organization (WHO) named it coronavirus disease-19 officially.",

Through the efforts of the whole country and people in China, the situation is basically stable. Despite a phased victory in the fight against the outbreak of COVID-19 in China, the situation outside China has become serious, more than 160 countries in six continents had reported cases of COVID-19. It is frightening that the number of confirmed cases outside China continued to rise, with a cumulative total of more than 200,000, of which Italy, Spanish, Germany and the United States of America were seriously affected(World Health Organization,2020). At present, COVID-19 is not only a matter of China, it has become a threat to the health of people around the world. Through this study, it can bring some experience of diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 to medical practitioners in various countries around the world, in order to strive to win this war without gunpowder as soon as possible.",

A recent study showed an overall case-fatality rate of 2.3%( Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team,2020) in COVID-19 patients, which is lower than the mortality of Based on the study to SARS and MERS, there is no specific treatment to coronavirus infection currently (Arabi et al.,2020) , in addition to supportive therapy. In this study, all patients received antiviral therapy. The most commonly drug is kaletra, which was found to reduce viral loads and improve clinical symptoms during the treatment in a study (Lim et al.,2020) . But randomized controlled clinical trials are required to further confirm the clinical efficacy of kaletra. Moreover, it is still controversial about corticosteroid treatment. There are several critical patients in this study, who were given to corticosteroid treatment based on the diagnostic and treatment protocol for COVID-19 (version 5)(General Office of National Health Commission, General Office of National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine ,2020). However, the available clinical evidence is insufficient to support the efficacy of glucocorticoids in the treatment of COVID-19(World Health Organization,2020; Russell et al.,2020) . A retrospective study on critically ill patients with MERS found that the use of glucocorticoids did not reduce fatality rate within 90 days. Conversely, it may delay the clearance of viral RNA in respiratory tract (Arabi et al.,2018) .",
