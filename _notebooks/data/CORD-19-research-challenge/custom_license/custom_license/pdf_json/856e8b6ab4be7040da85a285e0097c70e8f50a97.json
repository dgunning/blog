            "text": "The crystal structure of two cathepsin L molecules complexed with thyroglobulin type-1 (PDB code 1ICF) was used as the starting point for the modeling study. Structure manipulation and visualization were carried out in Insight II 2005 (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). The missing residues, Glu-176, Ser-177 and Asp-178 (cathepsin L numbering) were inserted and a single cathepsin L molecule was extracted. Initially, crystallographic water molecules buried in the mature enzyme were retained. Hydrogen atoms were added, and the pH was set to 5.5. Both N and C termini of the protein were in the ionized state with the histidine-163 side-chain as the imidazolium cation. The catalytic side-chain of cysteine-25 was modeled as a thiolate anion. The cathepsin L backbone was tethered and the complex was subjected to conjugate gradient energy minimization and molecular dynamics using a fixed dielectric function and the CVFF force field. This complex served as the template for the initial docking of our inhibitors.Bound conformations of the inhibitors were modeled by docking them according to the template followed by a conformational search using a Monte Carlo minimization (MCM) procedure using the Affinity module. Starting structures for each cycle of minimization were obtained by randomly perturbing one or more dihedral angles in the inhibitor.Perturbations involving random changes in the side chain dihedral angles as well as crankshaft rotations were carried out. Residues of the protein around the active site including the S3\u00b4-S3 subsites, were allowed to relax during the minimization.Monte Carlo minimizations of cathepsin L -inhibitor complexes were collected in groups of 200 and examined for hydrogen bonding, total energy, interaction energy, and distances of inhibitor atoms from the Cys-25 thiolate, among other parameters, and then ranked by the interaction energies. The inhibitors with the best interaction energies and best Cys-25 thiolate-thiocarbonyl carbon (inhibitor) distances were selected for further evaluation by manual visualization. ",
