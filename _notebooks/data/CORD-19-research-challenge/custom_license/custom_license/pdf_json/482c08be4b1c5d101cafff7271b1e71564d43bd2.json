Naturally, this creates social tension -a proverbial \"generational gap,\" a schism between the ideals and principles of one generation and another. Such a gap has always existed, and failing to navigate it successfully leads to miscommunication and misunderstanding, impairing our ability to function as a highly effective community. As a community of cardiac, thoracic, and congenital surgeons with members at all stages of training and development, we educators from the Baby Boomer Generation and Generation X must be able to bridge this generational gap in order effectually teach our Millennial learners.",

Don't look at the stranger and jump to conclusions\u2026 look at the stranger's world.\" 1 Like every other generation, the world of Millennials is indeed unique.",

            "text": "The past four decades have witnessed technological advances at an exponential pace. Because this period of innovation corresponded with their childhood, as the Counsel of Economic Advisors noted, \"it has shaped the ways that Millennials interact with technology and seems to have affected their expectations for creativity and innovation in their own work lives.\" 2 The COVID-19 pandemic has served as a catalyst for changes to medical education, including greater integration of technology such as online lectures and journal clubs. Nonetheless, we non-Millennials would be painting a shallow brush to presume tech is the only part of the bridge that we need to understand to cross the generational gap. Based on census data, Millennials represent the largest and most diverse post-war generation; many are immigrants or children of immigrants. Though they value quality of life and personal time, Millennials, more than any other generation, want to make a positive contribution to and want to be leaders in their communities. 2 In this issue of the Journal, Dr. Luc and co-authors, who interestingly span several generations, provide an expert opinion on bridging the generational gap between cardiothoracic surgical educators and Millennial learners 3 . Though all learners are unique, this manuscript provides a high-value blueprint of common generational traits, helping us better understand the social context in which Millennials exist and train, and offer solutions to allow us to be more effective mentors and teachers. Their work is only partially complete. In the near future, Generation Z learners, will be standing across from us in the classroom and operating room. If we want to continue to be effective teachers, we will also have to understand the social context of the world in which they live in order to help them maximize their potential.",
