On March 26th, WHO issued six prioritised strategies, to be undertaken by governments to cope with the pandemic. The strategies were as follow: Expand, train and deploy health-care workers; Implement systems to find suspected cases; Ramp up production of tests and increase availability; Identify facilities that can be transformed into coronavirus health centres; Develop plans to quarantine cases; and Refocus government measures on suppressing the virus [1] . Lowering and delaying the epidemic peak is important. Uncontrolled measures will lead to the rapid increase in the number of cases, reach the peak earlier and require more capacity of healthcare systems to respond, while stringent control measures implemented early will help to lower the number of cases, delay reaching the peak and need considerably lower capacity of the healthcare systems [4] .",

This paper can be viewed as 'real-time evaluation' as it provides insights and lessons for all stakeholders to improve and adjust existing policy options mainly at national level from April 2020 till the end of the crisis. There are three objectives of this paper. First, to highlight key response strategies and actions in responding to COVID-19 emergencies in Indonesia. Second, to analyse the gaps and opportunities in these responses. Third, to put forward recommendations toward rapid, comprehensive and more systematic approaches in the short-and longer-term.",

During this period, despite reports of increasing numbers of infection from all countries surrounding Indonesia at that time, Indonesia did not issue any form of travel restrictions and specific quarantines of travellers coming in/coming back to Indonesia, even from severely hit countries such as China. On January 27, 2020, Indonesia issued a travel restriction from Hubei province, which was at that time, the epicentre of global COVID-19, while at the same time evacuated 238 Indonesians from Wuhan. After the initial and subsequent reports of infections, Indonesia started to realize the direness of the situation, and has since issued various policies and actions to tackle COVID-19, including appointing 100 domestic general hospitals as Referral Hospitals (Rumah Sakit Rujukan) on March 3, 2020. To cope with the everincreasing number of COVID-19 patients, the number of Referral Hospitals was increased to 227 on March 18, 2020. However, despite such efforts, the number of victims keeps increasing rapidly. The Ministry of Health of Indonesia provides live data on COVID-19 impacts in Indonesia [6] .

At least since 11 March 2020, the public had started to critically demand data transparency toward the government, which such plea emerged in digital news media [10, 11] of which during the time there were already 27 cases reported. The lack of data transparency might have caused the underreporting of the actual number of cases, or, the dissemination of probably the actual number of cases detected, but not the number of actual infections, which could be undetected because of, for example, the lack of proper diagnoses. Such misinformation could severely impede the government's future responses. This indicated the possibility that such efforts were not enough.",

This happened for a few months, even when various reports had shown that Indonesia's neighbouring countries had reported at least one infection. The lack of rapid scientific surveys deployed by the government to make swift decisions and actions has caused many pseudo-scientific \"explanations\" for the cause spreading in Indonesia, as seen in the mass and social media, ranging from racial superiority to religious and paranormal reasons (e.g. [13] ). However, later reports strongly indicated that zero case was scientifically improbable, for example as suggested by Harvard University [8] and later severely criticised by the Indonesian Minister of Health [14] . Various international mass media and foreign bodies outside Indonesia even became very stringent and went as far as questioning the abilities of Indonesian scientists and medical practitioners, as well as the presence of enough technical facilities and skills to detect and diagnose the disease. Further investigations reported that many of the suspected COVID-19 persons were only diagnosed clinically and not tested using the PCR method, including Indonesians evacuated from Wuhan. This could be one of the reasons for the (most likely incorrect) report of zero infections, during the initial period of this global pandemic. At present, through extensive coordination among different institutions, Indonesia has started to do PCR analyses on suspected citizens. However, when compared to other countries such as Japan, Korea, and China, the number is not enough to reflect the most likely actual present condition of infection in Indonesia.",

            "text": "On March 19, 2020, President Joko Widodo announced that Indonesia will conduct massive testing by conducting rapid detection tests on the citizens [15] . This test will use recently developed testing kits, which are based on serology [16] . Results will be out in 10-30 min, which is much faster than the PCR test (about 1-8 h, depending on the method). Further news from the mass media suggested that the Indonesian government has ordered 500,000 testing kits from China. The mass media have reported the results of the first batch of tests conducted in Jakarta: 121 positive, and 10,338 negatives [16, 17] . The problem is, although testing kits have been developed and even sold by various companies, none of the kits have passed clinical testing, without any clinical assessment on the actual specificity and sensitivity. Some reports have indicated that other coronaviruses, or even dengue, might give false positive results. Moreover, unlike the PCR test, which targeted the presence of actual genetic materials of SARS-CoV2 in samples, immunoreaction-based testing targets the presence of antibodies in the bodies of patients. The antibodies for SARS-CoV2 are known to be present from 5 to 14 days after symptoms appear, which means the antibody-antigen-based test cannot detect any infection prior to symptoms appearance, and thus might give false negative results. Meanwhile, the test might also detect antibodies presence on recovering or cured patients, and thus giving another false positive result. Indonesians shouldn't be used as guinea pigs, giving these pharmaceutical companies free nation-wide clinical trials. Therefore, such data must be handled very carefully, since a recent report by the Business Insider suggested that such rapid tests using serology-based RDT are only 30% accurate [16] .",

Only those tested positive by RDT must be required to do PCR test. Meanwhile, those tested negative, must take the test multiple times, up to at least three times, after an interval of 5 to 7 days, considering the incubation period of the virus.

Widening the deficit means that there will be added spending.",

However, the Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI; Tentara Nasional Indonesia) participation in the war against COVID-19 is necessary. We are not able to assess their effectiveness exhaustively and fairly here, but we can briefly highlight their involvements. For example, the use of military assets and personals is essential in this response where military aircrafts have been used to help with the logistical response at times where no civilian system can provide such support. TNI has been involved in the preparation of emergency hospitals in some locations from Wisma Atlet (Jakarta), Natuna, Pulau Sebaru, Pulau Galang Pangdam. Therefore, their roles in this non-traditional war have been essential. Interestingly, we also observed an emerging paradigm of non-traditional view of security forces, in social media and mainstream media during the last few weeks. In this view, frontline medical workers including doctors and nurses have been viewed as 'armies', combatting in the war against COVID-19. Since enforcement to ensure social distance and other mitigation measures are in place, we also observed that the role of the police has been critical in enforcing mitigation measures. The Head of the Police (Kapolri) issued a Mandate Letter (No. MAK/2/III/2020) on 19 March 2020 to prohibit mass gatherings or group activities both in public and private environments.",

Those who have been exposed to the virus can replace Friday Prayers with Zuhr prayer at their respective residences. For the management of corpses exposed to COVID-19, the MUI stipulates that bathing and caving must be in accordance with medical protocols and carried out by competent authorities with due regards to the provisions of the Shari'a.

When school is closed nationwide, some families decide to go for mass family holiday and to go back to their hometown. In this sense, the context evolved in a vicious cyclical way that hinder appropriate responses both by the government and communities. Although later on, also due to extremely high exposure of the narratives in all types of media, the COVID-19, pandemic, and Corona, also terms such as WFH (work from home) as the relatively contemporary terminologies had slowly entered the public acceptance as the new norm.

Identifying and mapping every single infected person with close contacts will be helpful for contact tracing and mass rapid test. 2. Coordinating, collaborating, and utilizing all of PCR laboratories (research institutes, universities, hospitals, clinics, local government) to support PCR-based diagnoses. More attention must also put on health infrastructure development including health laboratory development in all provinces. 3. Rapid detection tests (RDT) using kits based on antibody detections are known to be far less accurate than the PCR-based tests. Therefore, such tests must be conducted very thoughtfully, and the results must be handled with care. For example, multiple tests up to at least three times must be conducted for those tested negatives, while PCR tests must be done on those tested positive. However, because of the rapidity, obtained data can be used as a ballpark in order to get a broad view about the range and scope of COVID-19 spread. Preferably whenever possible, rapid PCR methods using the most current techniques (e.g. microfluidic RT-PCR), which is much faster (ca. 45 min until result) than the conventional methods (3-8 h) , should be adopted, rather than the serologybased RDT. 4. Increase the number of referral hospitals adequately and equip such hospitals for treatment properly. This includes to properly set up treatment facilities (e.g. respirators, isolation chambers), diagnostics facilities (e.g. PCR machines, diagnostics kits), medicine and pharmaceuticals, management, medical doctors, specialists, nurses, health volunteers, and safety and protection equipment for frontline practitioners (e.g. safety goggles, protection masks, hazardous materials suits). 5. Incentive and disincentive. Incentive should be given to those who voluntarily report their symptoms to hotline/referral hospitals. Disincentive must be implemented to those who are still available out there without any relevant reason. 6. Mass spraying of disinfectant on the road, house, park, schools should be reconsidered since it may have little or no effect and may harm the inhalation of the people. 7. Develop proper health infrastructure including a proper government health laboratory system, which might include, not limited to, resources of private diagnostic labs, research institutes, and universities, in all provinces, to allow local COVID-19 testing without delays. We suggest that the MoH and DoHs at local levels should be more aggressive to expand the coverage of the whole six building blocks of the health system. 8. Furthermore, in the long term, COVID-19 reveals the need to mainstream the One-Health approach where animal and human health development should be integrated in order to achieve SDGs. Current approach that separates both health systems has proven not effective as revealed by COVID-19. The COVID-19 case has yet to be tied with Indonesia's elephant in the room, namely rampant wildlife trade at multiple scales. For example, domestic wildlife markets especially in Java (e.g. [35] ) are ongoing, as are animals as source of drugs including traditional Chinese medicines business in Sumatra, and bushmeat consumption, including endangered bats in North Sulawesi. There are delicate issues, because it is a matter of traditional food and part of the culture. Allowing all these to continue without reserve goes contrary to the safety principles against the wildlife to human infections (zoonoses) [36] . Systems need to be built to ensure safety (e.g. by testing for known pathogens) to prevent novel zoonotic pandemics [37] .",

Three global measures were outlined: (1) Global stimulus package to the amount of double-digit percentage points of the world's GDP, focussing on developing countries; (2) regional mobilisation to consider impacts, monetary coordination, fiscal and social measures, with involvement from private and financial sector,; (3) National solidarity needs to prioritize social cohesion and provide fiscal stimulus for the most vulnerable along with support to small-and mediumsized enterprises, decent work and education. This is extremely relevant for Indonesia. The economy needs to have the capacity to absorb the impact and focus on the most vulnerable people.

Multi-disciplinary advice by health/public health researchers and practitioners, social scientists, economists, legal experts, modellers will lead to better understanding of the contexts and potential impacts. Big data, artificial intelligence, open-science and citizen-data can accelerate current responses. Countries such as Singapore, South Korea, and China have attributed their aggressive monitoring through the use of these technologies.",

Transparency is key to managing pandemic as it provides a condition where infected persons can be quickly identified and treated accordingly in a timely fashion. Central and local government must develop an integrated strategy of crisis and risk communication strategy [44] that allow people to be informed to minimise any irrational behaviours such as 'panic' buying at local markets. It is also important to build the capacity of high-level officials at local level governments (provincial and districts) on decision making and crisis communication during crises situations. A good start has been made with provinces developing their own databases and websites sharing monitoring data for each the provincial jurisdiction.",

Interesting short videos raising awareness for self-isolation were made by members of the public, including by Najwa Shihab (renowned news anchor) and Nadiem Makarim (Minister of Education). More recently the awareness videos were made in local languages (Javanese, Sundanese and Sasaknese). However, many times also the social media has been invaded by dangerous hoaxes e.g. promoting chloroquine as a reliable drug to fight COVID-19, or alcohol-based hand sanitizer (and not soap) as the most effective prevention. The government has developed a hoax buster http://www.covid10.go.id/hoaks, albeit with limited amounts of information. Civil society such as Anti Hoax society group (Masyarakat anti fitnah) is also developing their own hoax buster such as https://turnbackhoax.id/.",
