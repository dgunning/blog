The existence of a filtrable infectious agent was first recognized 100 years ago, when studies in Russia and The Netherlands on the infectious agent that caused the mosaic disease of tobacco plants led to the concept of infectious agents that were smaller than bacteria 1. At the beginning of the 20th century, the first human virus was discovered yellow fever virus -and for much of the intervening time the study of viruses has been involved primarily in the identification and characterization of viral agents that cause disease. However, viruses are now beginning to be associated not only with the cause of disease, but also with its cure. Viruses are being used as vectors for the introduction of heterologous genes into cells, which means that they can be used for the delivery of therapeutic agents into cells, as well as for gene therapy.",

Schlesinger levels of specific viral proteins, which makes them good candidates as vectors for heterologous gene expression2, 3. To use the RNA viral genome as a vector necessitates first converting the RNA genome into a genomic complementary DNA (eDNA), which is then placed downstream from a promoter for a bacterial or bacteriophage DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Inserts ofheterologous DNA that encode the proteins of interest may then be introduced into the eDNA downstream from a strong viral promoter by standard restriction-endonuclease digestion and ligation techniques. The whole eDNA is then transcribed in vitro, using the RNA polymerase promoter, into the genomic viral RNA, which, in many cases, can be directly transfected into cultured cells, or into plants or animals. Many RNA viruses possess relatively small genomes; cloning of the recombinant eDNA can therefore be accomplished in only a few steps. Many of the RNA viruses that infcct higher eukaryotic organisms replicate exclusively in the cytoplasm and hence expression of their genes will be independent of host nuclear functions and will not involve any splicing.",

The latter two virus families have RNA genomes with a single open reading frame (ORF), from which the individual viral proteins are generated by co-and posttranslational proteolytic cleavages.

If regions flanking the minimal promoter are also present, the level of transcription of the subgenomic RNA is increased. The viral structural proteins translated from 26S RNA are also synthesized as a polyprotein, with the N-terminal capsid protein functioning as an autoprotease to cleave itself from the nascent polypeptide. The capsid protein can then interact with the genomic RNA to form the nucleocapsid. There is a specific recognition signal located near the 5' terminus of the RNA that serves as the nucleation site for encapsidation 12 and thus ensures that the genomic, but not the subgenomic RNA, is packaged.
