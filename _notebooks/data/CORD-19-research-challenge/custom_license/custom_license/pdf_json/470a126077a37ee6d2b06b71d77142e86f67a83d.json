We hope this information will be helpful to the physician who cares for children but who must function without extensive laboratory support. We hope, in addition, to emphasize that the diagnostic virology laboratory has come of age. Technics are currently available that will give the practicing physician specific etiologic information rapidly and at a reasonable cost. In the absence of such diagnostic facilities h careful history, physical examination and generally available laboratory studies will enable the physician to recognize a wide variety of clinical syndromes caused by viruses, and in some cases the specific virus can be named with a high degree of accuracy. Unfortunately many viral diseases do not produce clinically recognizable syndromes, and others closely mimic bacterial infections. In these patients viral diagnostic studies are most helpful.",

One approach to the diagnosis of viral infections is to classify the diseases that may be produced by a single virus.

The usual interval from the first sign or symptom to significant inspiratory stridor is less than 12 hours. There is a history of sore throat and dysphagia.

It is characterized by preceding nonspecific upper respiratory tract symptoms with low grade fever and the subsequent development of a brassy cough and moderate-to-severe respiratory distress. On examination, the child is tachypneic, the anterior posterior diameter of the chest is increased, the expiratory phase of respiration is prolonged and there are suprasternal and intercostal retractions. On auscultation of the chest, wheezes, rhonchi and/or tales are present in all lung fields. Roentgenograms of the chest show hyperinflation, flattened diaphragm and air bronchogram (Fig. 5) . The heart rate usually is increased, and the liver edge is easily palpable below the costal margin.

In general, it is a relatively mild disease and is unassociated with focal neurologic signs. The duration usually is less than a week, and sequelae are rare. Enteroviruses of the same serotype produce simultaneous epidemics of aseptic meningoencephalitis in many widely separated parts of the country. In general, the clinical characteristics of the illness are similar irrespective of the group and serotype of virus, and for practical pur-poses there is no particular advantage to the identification of the virus beyond recognition that it is an enterovirus. This is true for poliovirus, which often produces a benign CNS illness, though the clinical manifestations may include anterior born cell disease with asymmetric flaccid paralysis, bulbar disease or encephalitis. Other enteroviruses may rarely cause a polio-like disease with specific neurologic deficit. ECHO and Coxsackie viruses are frequently isolated from the CSF.",

The severity of herpes encephalitis is such that continued studies with promising chemotherapeutic agents are fully justifiable. In order that the results may be evaluated, diagnosis must be confirmed by biopsy and therapy must be begun prior to the development of irreversible brain damage.

The virus is transmitted to humans by the mosquito, and therefore the disease occurs primarily in the summer and early fall. Fever, headache and vomiting are the initial symptoms, followed by lethargy, disorientation and, in severe cases, semicoma or coma.

A transforming factor has been isolated from throat secretions of patients with infectious mononucleosis. This factor is capable of transforming cord blood leukocytes into continuous cell lines. Its activity can be neutralized by specific E-B antibody and can be detected as late as 16 months after onset of symptoms.

Forty years ago Tidy described three clinical presentations of mononucleosis: (1) a glandular form characterized by a short prodromal period followed by enlargement of any or all groups of lymph nodes, with or without accompanying constitutional symptoms; (2) an anginose form of pharyngitis, with injection or membrane formation; and (3) a febrile form seen in adults, with malaise, fever, headache and frequent chills. Lymph node enlargement may occur at any time during the illness in the third form. The classic triad of fever, exudative pharyngitis and adenopathy may be present in only 40-50% of patients. The early symptoms are nonspecific, most patients experiencing malaise, low grade fever, headache and sore throat. Fever ranges from 99~ ~ F and subsides by 21-28 days in the majority of patients. Relapse after 5 or more days without fever is rare. Posterior cervical lymph node enlargement differentiates mononucleosis from other causes of cervical adenopathy. The nodes are bilateral, discrete, usually nontender, nonsuppurative and they may produce a \"bull-neck\" appearance. Axillary and inguinal adenopathy may be present. By the end of the first week the throat becomes diffusely injected or has a membranous exudate over the tonsils. A palatal enanthem, consisting of crops of sharply circumscribed petechiae of the uvula or the soft palate just about the uvula, appears between the 5th and 12th days. Secondary infection with fusobacteria and hemolytic streptococci gives the breath a foul odor. Severe hyperplasia of the nasopharyngeal lymphoid tissue causes nasal obstruction with secretions and gives a nasal quality to the voice; it may lead to refusal to swallow water or even saliva (Fig. 10) . Rarely, severe lymphoid hyperplasia may produce tracheal compression requiring tracheostomy. The face is frequently puffy, with edema of the eyelids.
