It has four common genotypes (G), with G1 and G2 mainly infecting man, and G3 and G4 infecting a variety of animals. 2 However, now human HEV infections have been reported with all 4 genotypes. 3 Like hepatitis A it is transmitted via the faecal-oral route and has traditionally been more associated with travel in HEV-endemic countries. However, in recent years, HEV has been found to be widespread in the UK swine population and related pork products on sale to the public. 4, 5 Recent 2016 recommendations for the routine screening of HEV in blood and organ donors, 6 have increased awareness that HEV infection may also be a cause of acute hepatitis. This differential diagnosis is of particular importance in pregnant women, in whom HEV infection can cause high mortality. 7 We present recently diagnosed HEV cases from different specialties, together with HEV sequence analysis, demonstrating the variety of referral routes for this infection.",

Concerns for overuse of these drugs with resultant worsening bacterial resistance, more adverse drug reactions (ADR), and the increased risk of Clostridium difficile infection have been a focus of educational interventions for clinicians, the public, and policymakers. 1, 2 Earlier trend studies 3-7 involving segments of the population in the UK have been reported and provide a profile of fluoroquinolone use, but have inconsistent results with no detailed information on types of fluoroquinolone-related ADR.

This has been the subject of national campaigns in the UK to reduce the use of fluoroquinolones and have likely impacted the trend data of fluoroquinolone use described in our study. 4,8 , 9 The development of fluoroquinolone resistance among aerobic gram-negative bacilli has reduced use of this drug class and could have contributed to the trend data displayed in the current investigation. Interestingly, with the reduction in fluoroquinolone \"burden\" on bacteria seen in clinical practice, improvement in in vitro susceptibility of some organisms has been described. 10 A major limitation of this work is that information is lacking so that we are unable to identify causal factors responsible for the de- clining use of oral fluoroquinolones in the community-based practice in England. As cited previously, use of the Yellow Card system to identify ADR is dependent on passive reporting and is biased by the likelihood that non-severe reactions are less often reported, as evidenced by the data presented in the current survey. Based on findings presented herein, there has been a marked reduction in oral fluoroquinolone use in the ambulatory care setting in England. Ciprofloxacin has accounted for the bulk of this use; reports of serious ADR coupled with antimicrobial stewardship programs that have advocated for diminished use of oral fluoroquinolones have likely been responsible for the decline, although cause-and-effect was not evaluated.",

This mutation contributes to escape from the NP-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. [6] [7] [8] In fact, among the Oct 2017-Apr 2018 UK influenza A/H3N2 sequences available in influenza sequence databases (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data-GISAID: https://www.gisaid.org/ ), 462/500 had already acquired the V197I NP mutation compared to just 46/455 in 2016/2017.

This suggests that although ducks are not the major host of 2013 H7N9, a duck H7 lineage which is distant from the 2013 H7N9 viruses is circulating in ducks in China.

This would make the control of H7N9 influenza viruses extremely difficult. Ducks are raised in great number in open fields in China, thus have many opportunities to contact domestic chickens and wild birds. Aquatic birds are the natural hosts for all AIV subtypes, thus, if H7N9 viruses extended their host range to ducks, this should raise concerns that these viruses might circulate among ducks, chickens and wild birds, and lead to greatly increased diversity in these viruses. Indeed, H7N9 have reassorted with duck AIVs and a novel H7N2 virus was detected. 7 Human infection by a novel H7N4 virus was found in December 2017. 9 Further dissemination by wild birds along flyways to new areas, and new reassortments are possible and need our concern.

Importantly, early diagnosis and treatment of IPA remains the most important factor to reduce mortality and improve outcome. [2] [3] [4] As an important limitation, GM testing is limited in particular by varying turnaround times (up to 3 days and more in some centers), dependent on the number of specimens to be tested and the distance/duration of transport between the clinical setting and the laboratory where the test is performed. 5 This limitation has in part been overcome by the newly formatted and European conformity (CE)-marked Aspergillus specific LFD, which detects an extracellular mannoprotein antigen secreted exclusively during active growth of Aspergillus species via the JF 5 monoclonal antibody. [6] [7] [8] [9] This test has been shown to increase performance for the diagnosis of IPA when used in combination with the galactomannan assay. [6] [7] [8] [9] Very recently a second point-of-care test for IPA, which detects galactomannan, was developed and CEmarked ( Aspergillus Galactomannan LFA). This test may overcome the limitation of long turnaround time by conventional galactomannan ELISA testing and may further facilitate point-of-care diagnosis of IPA. The objective of this study was to evaluate the new Aspergillus Galactomannan Lateral Flow Assay (LFA) and compare its performance against the Aspergillus specific LFD and other biomarkers for the diagnosis of IPA in patients with hematological malignancies.",

            "text": "Dear editor, Recently, the hemagglutinin characteristics, pathogenicity, and antigenic variation of highly pathogenic (HP) H7N9 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) were reported in this journal. 1 H7N9 AIVs have been endemic in chicken since their emergence in China in February 2013, 2 and have triggered five epidemics of human infections. 3 , 4 At first, the 2013 H7N9 viruses were nonpathogenic in chickens. However, some H7N9 viruses transitioned from low to high pathogenicity for chicken during the 5th wave. 5 , 6 These H7N9 HPAIVs were not only destructive to poultry, but also lethal to humans. In addition, H7N9 HPAIVs isolated in ducks in the past year can be systemically replicated and shed viruses in ducks. 1 , 7 Thus, in this study, we briefly assess the evolutionary patterns seen for H7 AIVs in ducks.We collected 2768 non-redundant H7 sequences isolated in China from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) database ( www.gisaid.org ), National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) ( www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/FLU ), and the Influenza Research Database (FluDB) ( www.FluDB.org ). The median-joint network showed that the H7Nx viruses (H7N1, H7N2, H7N3, H7N6, H7N7, H7N8 and H7N9) have circulated in ducks in China during the past decade (duck H7Nx lineage, Fig. 1 ). Duck H7Nx contributed HA to chicken H7N9 (2013 chicken H7N9 lineage, Fig. 1 ). 2 Since then (2013), the H7N9 LPAIVs have been circulating in domestic chicken and have caused human infections. These chicken H7N9 viruses, though, cannot replicate efficiently in ducks, 8 a conclusion that was supported by surveillance data, which showed that the H7N9 viruses were mainly isolated from chickens and humans ( Fig. 2 A) . However, a few viruses were iso-",

Results were read after 30 min and scores given ranging from 0 (i.e. negative), to 4 (highly positive). Results of both the LFD and LFA were each read by two interpreters who were blinded to IPA status, GM ELISA, and culture results. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 25 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A two-sided P-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The Human Research Protections Program at the University of California, San Diego approved the study protocol and all study-related procedures.A total of 24 samples from 24 patients were included in the analysis. Demographic characteristics and underlying diseases of the study population are displayed in Table 1 . A total of 10/24 (42%) of patients were receiving mold-active antifungal prophylaxis/therapy at the time of the BALF procedure. Performance of the Aspergillus -specific LFD, Aspergillus Galactomannan LFA, BALF culture, Galactomannan ELISA, as well as combinations of the assays are depicted in Table 2 .Both the Aspergillus -specific LFD and the Aspergillus Galactomannan LFA showed high sensitivities and specificities for prob-able/proven IPA versus no IPA, with sensitivities of close to 90% for the Aspergillus -specific LFD read after 25 min (LFD 25 min) and the Aspergillus Galactomannan LFA, and a specificity of 100% of the Aspergillus -specific LFD read after 15 min (LFD 15 min) ( Table 1 ) . Sensitivity reached 100% when either the Aspergillus -specific LFD (25 min) or the Aspergillus Galactomannan LFA resulted positive, with a specificity of 75% when the assays were used in combination. The Aspergillus -specific LFD and the Aspergillus Galactomannan LFA also gave a positive result in a proportion of the possible cases (e.g. in one of the possible cases both tests gave strong positive results, + + and 2, respectively) and the cases who fulfilled host criteria, had a positive BALF GM (4.77 and 1.51 ODI respectively), but did not have typical radiological criteria on chest CT (tests results were + + + and 2 in the case with the higher BALF GM level). This indicates that these POC tests may be useful in differentiating between those possible IPA cases.The strength of the result also provided some information for both the LFD and LFA. The single false positive test results for the LFD and the LFA were only low level positive (i.e., + and 1, respectively). BALF GM levels were significantly higher in those with at least a + + positive test result ( n = 7) versus + positive test results ( n = 4) with the Aspergillus -specific LFD 15 min (median 4.77 ODI versus median 1.05 ODI; p = 0.042). The same was true for the Aspergillus -specific LFD 25 min (median 3.62 ODI in the 8 cases with a + + or stronger positive test result versus median < 0.5 ODI in the 5 cases with a + test result; p = 0.019). In contrast there was no significant difference BALF GM levels when comparing scores of 1 versus 2 or higher for the Aspergillus Galactomannan LFA (median 2.46 ODI versus median 1.37 ODI; p = 0.8).Given the importance of early and reliable diagnosis of IPA for targeted and successful treatment, rapid tests allowing for point-of-care diagnosis of IPA are an extremely attractive tool.",
