The oral and nasal swabs returned \"weak positive\" results. Additional swab specimens were collected from the dog on two further occasions over the next five days, and they again tested \"weak positive\". The dog remained under mandatory quarantine at the facility for 14 days before returning home. Nevertheless, despite having no signs of clinical illness, the dog died just 2 days after returning home. The cause of death remains unknown because the owner did not consent to post-mortem examination. However, given the dog's elderly age, and because he reportedly had underlying health conditions, experts believe it is unlikely that his death was related to the positive SARS-CoV-2 test result [7] [8] [9] .",

            "text": "Inevitably, the crucial focus right now during this current pandemic is to control human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and this requires each of us to play a key role to reduce community spread of the virus. However, the unfolding of this pandemic has again highlighted the complex interrelationships that exist between animals, people, and the environment. Ultimately, a multidisciplinary One Health approach will thus inevitably be critical to develop appropriate strategies to effectively prevent and control future outbreaks of COVID-19. And, given the speculation that wild live animal species may be linked to this pandemic, this collaborative approach will also require the expertise of wildlife forensic specialists. At best, trading at wet markets like the one in Wuhan often tends to occur under poor regulatory and welfare standards, and illegal wildlife trade frequently coexists at these locations. Indeed, many experts also hope that this crisis could represent the end of the global wildlife trade.",
