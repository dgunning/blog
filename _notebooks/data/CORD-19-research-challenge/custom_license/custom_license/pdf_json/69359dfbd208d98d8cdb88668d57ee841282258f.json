Clinicians in all specialties are able to keep current due to this rapid turn-around of essential information. Providers who work on the \"front-lines\" as firstresponders or in the emergency department, as well as in hospital wards, the intensive care unit, or the outpatient setting, need to implement a variety of mechanisms to help curb the spread of this viral pandemic.",

Furthermore, \"community\" stethoscopes used by multiple individuals and sharing of stethoscopes should be avoided, if possible, in the midst of this pandemic in order to prevent nosocomial spread and potential self-inoculation. Although the stethoscope is a small piece of our equipment, as healthcare professionals, we can employ small maneuvers in attempt to curtail the spread of this virus, and this includes regular sanitizing of our stethoscopes.",
