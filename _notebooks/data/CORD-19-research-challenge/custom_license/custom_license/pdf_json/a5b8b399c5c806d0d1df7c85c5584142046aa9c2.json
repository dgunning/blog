            "text": "Nucleic acid amplification tests for viral RNA: Detection of the virus is achieved by identifying the viral RNA through nucleic acid amplification, usually using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 4 The most commonly tested sample types are swabs taken from the nasopharynx (more sensitive) and/or oropharynx. Swabs are then placed into a liquid to release viral RNA into the solution and subsequently amplified using reverse transcription-PCR. 4 These tests are the gold standard for acute illness. Accuracy of the test is affected by the quality of the sample and RNA may degrade over time. Since SARS-CoV-2 can infect anyone and result in transmission prior to the onset of symptoms or possibly, even without individuals ever developing symptoms, aggressive testing/screening of asymptomatic patients has been considered. 4 Antibody detection via serology: The other broad category of tests include those detecting IgM, IgA, IgG, or total antibodies. 4 Clinicians should note that SARS-CoV-2 is not typically present in blood. An infection causes white blood cells to make antibody proteins that help the immune system identify the viruses and stop them or mark infected cells for destruction. 5 Development of an antibody response to infection is host-dependent and takes time. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, studies suggest that most of the patients seroconvert in 7-11 days after exposure to the virus, although some patients may develop antibodies sooner. Therefore, antibody testing is not useful in the setting of an acute illness. 4 It is still unknown whether individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 who subsequently recover will be protected, either fully or partially, from future infection with SARS-CoV-2 or for how long the protective immunity may last. It has been recently reported that the UK has ordered 3.5 million sero- logical tests. 6 In the United States of America, on 2 April 2020, the Food and Drug Administration granted approval to a \"rapid\" serological test made by Cellex\u00a9 that can allegedly generate results in as little as 15-minutes.' 7 Serological tests are cheaper to run than PCR, which has an estimated cost of \u00a330/test. Serological tests can cost less than \u00a36/test. Recently, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits based on recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and spike protein were used for detecting IgM and IgG antibodies in China. They were reported to be cheap and had a high sensitivity. 8 Testing recommendation for patients planned for surgery: This possible guideline is be based on the known incubation period or incubation time (IT) of the SARS-CoV-2. In March 2020, Lauer et al published the incubation period estimates from patients connected to the disease-origin province in China. 9 The consensus was that the median IT of the virus was 5.1 days (mean IT: 5.5 days). In most of the patients who became symptomatic (approximately 97.5% of the symptomatic infected persons), symptoms appeared at 11 or 12 days after the exposure. Fewer than 2.5% were symptomatic within 2.2 days and the vast majority were symptomatic within 14 days. The estimated median IT to fever was 5.7 days. 9 However, it is known that patients who remain asymptomatic (30% of exposed cases) or mildly symptomatic (56% of exposed cases) can transmit the infection and this group was not included in the aforementioned study. 9 Taking these facts into consideration, patients who are scheduled for surgery should always be assumed to be potential carriers of the virus throughout the duration of their hospital stay, even if they pass the pre-assessment triage including normal temperature, no history of exposure or travel, and no respiratory symptoms. Patients are \"screened\" with the gold standard PCR test 24 hours before the surgery as well as with an antibody screen and then isolated in their rooms with no visitors allowed. This is later limited to one visitor for 15 minutes a day at a distance of 1 to 2 metres away, wearing appropriate protection such as a surgical mask and a gown. Obviously, if patients show positive result in the PCR test, they are isolated, the national COVID-19 public health protocols are followed (including protocols for exposed staff), and the surgery is postponed. If they show a negative result in the PCR, but are positive for the antibody, they will not require further testing during their hospital stay. If patients show negative results in PCR as well as in antibody tests, they are tested with PCR every week during their stay and always undergo an \"exit test PCR\" on discharge (Fig. 1) . Clinicians must be mindful that a negative test does not negate the possibility that an individual is infected.",
