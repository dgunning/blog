There is currently no antiviral therapeutic or widely available vaccine against dengue infection. The DENV RNA genome is methylated on its 5\u2032 cap by its NS5 protein. DENV bearing a single E216A point mutation in NS5 loses 2\u2032-O-methylation of its genome. While this mutant DENV is highly attenuated and immunogenic, the mechanism of this attenuation has not been elucidated. In this study, we find that replication of this mutant DENV is attenuated very early during infection. This early attenuation is not dependent on a functional type I interferon response and coincides with early activation of the innate immune response. Taken together, our data suggest that 2\u2032-O-methylation of DENV genomic RNA is important for evasion of the host immune response during the very early stages of infection as the virus seeks to establish infection.",

            "text": "The innate immune response provides the first line of defense against virus infection, as the host activates multiple signaling pathways in the minutes and hours after infection in its attempts to limit virus replication and dissemination. Pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) play a crucial role in this early phase of antiviral response as they serve both as detectors of virus infection and triggers of the innate immune response. The Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 3 and 7, and cytoplasmic RNA sensors retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), are the crucial PRRs against RNA virus infection. These sensors recognize conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and 5\u2032triphosphate single-stranded RNA, and trigger the activation of innate immune response (Kumar, Kawai, and Akira, 2011) . In particular, RIG-I and MDA5 are the primary sensors for foreign RNA in the cytoplasm. While RIG-I and MDA5 are ubiquitously expressed at low basal levels, their expression levels are rapidly up-regulated in response to type I IFN. Both sensors are activated by dsRNA, with RIG-I having preferential binding to short dsRNAs with a 5\u2032triphosphate group, and MDA5 recognizing longer dsRNA molecules. Activation of either of these sensors triggers their binding to and activation of MAVS via their CARD domains, setting off a cascade of signaling activity beginning with activation of IRF3/7 and NF-\u03baB transcription factors, the production of type I interferon (IFN) and subsequent downstream activation of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) (Kawai et al., 2005; Kumar, Kawai, and Akira, 2011; Onoguchi et al., 2010) . This activation of ISGs plays an important role in the host antiviral response.",

            "text": "The DENV NS5 protein has multiple enzymatic functions as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase for genome replication (Ackermann and Padmanabhan, 2001) and methyltransferase (MTase) responsible for 5\u2032 RNA cap formation and methylation (Egloff et al., 2002; Ray et al., 2006) . In addition, flavivirus methyltransferases have 2\u2032-O-methylation activity on internal adenosines (Dong et al., 2012) . 2\u2032-O-methylation of the 5\u2032 RNA cap is crucial for evasion of host immune responses for multiple viruses (Dong et al., 2014) , although a loss of 2\u2032-O-methylation activity has varying effects in different viruses. WNV defective in 2\u2032-O-methylation activity is attenuated in cells with a fully functional type I IFN response and sensitive to inhibition by IFN-induced proteins with tetra-tricopeptide repeats (IFIT) proteins, but interestingly induces comparable levels of type I IFN to wild-type WNV (Daffis et al., 2010) . In contrast, coronaviruses (CoV) defective in 2\u2032-O-methylation are also attenuated in cells with a fully functional type I IFN response and highly sensitive to inhibition by type I IFN but induces higher expression of type I IFN (Zust et al., 2011) . This observed attenuation of the various 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant viruses prompted us to hypothesize that they could be potential vaccine candidates (Zhou et al., 2007) . Indeed, we and others have found that DENV, JEV and CoV defective in 2\u2032-O-MTase activity are attenuated in cells with a fully functional type I IFN response, and induced strong antiviral and antibody responses in monkey and mouse models Menachery et al., 2014; Zust et al., 2013) . These studies have shown that the type I IFN response, and especially paracrine IFN signaling (Schmid et al., 2015) , plays an important role in the animals' antiviral response to infection. But the exact mechanisms of this DENV attenuation and immune protection have not been fully characterized. In this study, we aim to expand on our understanding of this attenuation of DENV by the loss of its 2\u2032-O-MTase activity.",

Equal amounts (10 \u03bcg) of WT and 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant full length genomic RNA were electroporated into BHK-21 cells, which do not produce type I IFN (Sellers et al., 1968) . DENV replication was detected by immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) of DENV E protein expression for five days post-transfection (Fig. 1A) . Over the five-day time course, classic foci formation was observed, indicating progressive viral replication, secretion, and spread. However, the percentage of E protein-positive cells was significantly lower from the very first time point (day 1 post-transfection) when electroporated with the 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant DENV RNA compared to WT DENV RNA ( Fig. 1A and B ). This trend was maintained until day 5 posttransfection. As the percentage of E protein-positive WT RNAtransfected cells plateaued, the percentage of E protein-positive 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant RNA-transfected cells reached statistically similar levels as the percentage of E protein-positive WT RNA-transfected cells on day 5 post-transfection (Fig. 1B) . This result suggests that the replication rate of 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant DENV is already attenuated early during infection in BHK-21 cells.",

Comparison of the various virus growth curves revealed several notable observations. Firstly, replication of the 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant DENV was already lagging behind WT DENV replication by 1-log from the first time point on day 1 post-infection in both Vero and A549 cells (Fig. 1C) . This was in agreement with the virus growth kinetics in BHK-21 cells seen by IFA. In addition, the virus titers for each virus were statistically similar (p 40.05) in the two cell lines at 24 h post-infection, suggesting that replication of the 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant DENV is highly attenuated during the first 24 h post-infection regardless of the IFN-producing status of the infected cells. As virus replication progressed beyond the first 24 h, virus titers increased before beginning to plateau around two days post-infection in all cases. Here, we detected differences in plateaued virus titers between the two cell lines. In Vero cells, the viral titers for both viruses plateaued at statistically similar levels (p 40.05). In contrast, the viral titer of WT DENV was significantly higher than 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant DENV (p o0.05) in A549 cells. These trends are consistent with previous findings, and suggest that a fully functional type I IFN response plays a role in controlling the replication of the 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant DENV during the later stages of infection.",

The qPCR analysis revealed gene expression patterns similar to those observed in our microarray study for the time points 12 and 24 h post-infection, hence validating our microarray analysis ( Fig. 4A and B) . In contrast, an examination of the gene expression during the very early phase of infection (first 12 h post-infection) revealed a completely different pattern for a subset of these genes. We found that infection with 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant DENV triggered an earlier transcriptional response in A549 cells, as compared to infection with WT DENV, in this subset of genes including DDX58 (RIG-I), IFIH1 (MDA5), ISG15, IL8 (CXCL8), IFIT2, NFKB2, IRF1 and IRF7 (Fig. 4C) .

In fact, the mRNA levels of the three PRRs rose above basal levels as early as 2 h post-infection and stayed above basal levels throughout the first 24 h of infection. Infection with the WT virus revealed a vastly different trend of PRRs expression, as expression levels remained at basal levels during the first 10-12 h of infection before increasing significantly (Fig. 4) .

The presence of a properly methylated 5\u2032 cap on the virus genomic RNA is crucial for their ability to evade host immune responses (Dong et al., 2014) . Flaviviruses and coronaviruses defective in 2\u2032-O-methylation activity are attenuated in IFN-competent cells, and are inhibited by IFN-induced proteins with tetra-tricopeptide repeats (IFIT) Menachery et al., 2014; Szretter et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2007; Zust et al., 2011) . In light of these studies, it has been proposed that 2\u2032-O-methylation of the virus RNA genome enables it to mimic cellular mRNA and evade immediate detection by the host PRRs (Dong et al., 2014) . Hence the loss of this 5\u2032 cap structure could disrupt the virus's ability to successfully establish an infection by triggering an early innate immune response.",

That same study also demonstrated a proof of concept in an animal model that this 2\u2032-O-MTase-mutant DENV could provide full protection against subsequent challenge. But the exact mechanisms of this DENV attenuation and immune protection have not been fully characterized.

IFIT1 has been shown to modulate the sensitivity of 2\u2032-Omethylation (Daffis et al., 2010) , and replication of the 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant WNV is rescued in IFIT1 knockout cells (Szretter et al., 2012) .

While the latter attenuation is dependent on the type I IFN response, we show that the early attenuation coincides with the induction of a strong early innate immune response. Hence 2\u2032-O-methylation of the 5\u2032 cap of the genomic RNA is an essential element for dengue virus to evade early innate immune activation by the host as the virus seeks to establish infection. This phenomenon highlights the importance of host responses in controlling the early stages of DENV infection and suggests that DENV employs mechanisms of immune evasion that target multiple phases of infection. Such a strong early innate immune response is crucial for the subsequent activation of T and B cell responses (Zust et al., 2013) , which are important criteria in vaccine development. We thus suggest that this model virus may pose an asset in vaccine development with the heightened and immediate immune response from the host. This functional mutation may be combined with other specific viral mutations in the development of a rational approach for live-attenuated dengue vaccines.",

(A and B) BHK-21 cells electroporated with DENV RNA containing the 2\u2032-O-MTase mutation display a slower progressive viral replication compared to those electroporated with WT DENV RNA, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence analysis of the DENV E protein. Replication of the 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant DENV is significantly attenuated compared to WT DENV from day 1 postinfection, before catching up to statistically similar levels by day 5 post-infection. *Student's t-test, p o 0.01, between 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant and WT DENV RNA. (C) A time course study reveals the replication kinetics of WT and 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant DENV infection with the same MOI of A549 and Vero cells. Virus titers at each time point were collected and quantified by a plaque assay. Statistical significant differences are discussed in the text of the Results section.",

(A) Heat map depicting the expression pattern of the 1133 transcripts that are differentially expressed in 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant DENV-infected samples in comparison with mock, heat-inactivated (HI) WT DENV-and WT DENV-infected samples. Transcripts with high expression levels are shown in red and those with low expression levels are in green. (B) Microarray analyses of differentially expressed genes between 12 and 24 h post infection with 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant andwild-type DENV reveal that a significant enrichment in genes involved in the innate immune and type I interferon pathways. The p value was calculated by hypergeometric test with Benjamini-Hochberg (B-H) correction to investigate if a pathway was significantly up-or down-regulated. A p value of less than or equal to 0.05 indicates a pathway was less likely to be detected by chance. The ratio shows the proportion of genes in the gene list of interest that are involved in a certain pathway.

(C) The 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant DENV induces a significant early innate immune response from as early as 2 h post-infection. In contrast, the wild-type DENV does not trigger an innate immune response until after 12 h post infection. The Loess method was used to fit the relative abundance of each group across each time point post-infection. It estimates the mean value non-parametrically for each data point of each data set (solid line) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) values of the mean (dashed lines). The time points at which the 95% CI lines of the 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant DENV (green) and WT DENV (red) do not intersect denote instances of significant differences between them.",
