Promising in vitro data 3, 4 as well as anecdotal in vivo evidence of therapeutic benefit 5 have led many institutions, including Mayo Clinic, to consider the use of hydroxychloroquine as a first-line COVID-19 pharmacotherapy for the time being and spurred an array of clinical trials designed to assess the efficacy of repurposed hydroxychloroquine in both the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.",

With the theoretical possibility that a substantial proportion of the world population could receive hydroxychloroquine as first-line prophylaxis or treatment, including an estimated 3 million individuals with congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS), the number of hydroxychloroquine-mediated DI-SCDs could increase precipitously unless appropriate QTc monitoring algorithms are instituted.

Unfortunately, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, acquisition of the patient's QTc by the 12lead ECG, which requires additional personnel exposure (ie, ECG technician), and a necessity for serial ECGs, which requires exposure of complex equipment (multiple ECG wires), could further strain the already limited supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) in many countries. Alternatively, some FDA-approved consumer mobile ECG devices are capable of generating accurate QTc measurements. 19",

In contrast, a QTc value that exceeds the 99th percentile value for otherwise healthy individuals (ie, 460 ms in both sexes before puberty, 470 ms in postpubertal males, and 480 ms in postpubertal females), in the absence of any exogenous QTc-aggravating factors, may signal an individual at increased risk for QT-related ventricular arrhythmias. 20, 21 In contrast and as a frame of reference, the average QTc value was 470 ms for the more than 1400 patients with congenital LQTS who have been cared for in Mayo Clinic's Windland Smith Rice Genetic Heart Rhythm Clinic. Furthermore, with very few exceptions (amiodarone being one), patients with a resting QTc of 500 ms or more, whether secondary to congenital LQTS or acquired (QTc-prolonging drugs, QTcprolonging electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalemia, or QTc-prolonging disease states as detailed in Table 2 ), have a considerably greater risk for both DI-TdP and DI-SCD. [22] [23] [24] Accordingly, the baseline QTc value can be used to roughly approximate the patient's risk of DI-TdP/DI-SCD following initiation of a medication with QTc-prolonging potential. For patients with QTc values less than the 99th percentile for age/sex (ie, 460 ms in prepubertal males/females, 470 ms in postpubertal males, and 480 ms in postpubertal females [ Figure 1 \"green light\" status]), the risk of DI-TdP/DI-LQTS is low, and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (or other QTc-prolonging COVID-19 pharmacotherapies) should be initiated without delay as outlined in the QTc monitoring algorithm. Remember, whether by 12-lead ECG, telemetry, or smartphone-enabled acquisition of the ECG, if the noted QT interval is less than one-half the preceding RR interval, then the calculated QTc will always be less than 460 ms and the patient can be \"green light go\" for COVID-19 treatments that may have QTc-prolonging potential.",

For example, in younger patients with COVID-19 (ie, <40 years) who have only mild symptoms and a QTc of 500 ms or greater, it may be reasonable to avoid treatment altogether because the arrhythmia risk may outweigh the risk of development of COVID-19erelated acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, in patients with a QTc of 500 ms or greater presenting with progressively worsening respiratory symptoms or at greater risk (ie, >65 years of age, immunosuppressed, and/or high-risk comorbid conditions) for respiratory complications, the potential benefit of QTcprolonging COVID-19 pharmacotherapies may exceed the arrhythmia risk. Therefore, the ultimate goal of QTc surveillance in the COVID-19 pandemic should NOT be to identify those who cannot receive these medications but to identify those with compromised or reduced \"repolarization reserve\" in whom increased QTc countermeasures can and should be taken to mitigate the risk of drug-related death from DI-TdP/DI-SCD. 25 Ultimately, much of the risk-benefit calculus awaits determination of the therapeutic efficacy of hydroxychloroquine, with or without concomitant azithromycin.

The timing of on-therapy QTc surveillance will be dictated not only by the pharmacokinetics of the COVID-19 therapies used but also by the practical logistics of an institution's method of QTc monitoring. For the 12-lead ECG approach, if QTc surveillance is deemed important, then one machine should be designated for acquisition of the data and a limited number of ECG technicians/personnel should be used to minimize PPE utilization and personnel exposure. Also, the number of on-therapy QTc assessments should be constrained to minimize personnel exposure risk and PPE consumption. In this scenario, for those placed in red light status because their baseline QTc is 500 ms or greater, an initial ontherapy QTc should be obtained around 2 to 4 hours after the first dose and then again at 48 hours and 96 hours following treatment initiation. Patients receiving either green light or yellow light status can probably forego the early QTc assessment and wait until 48 hours and 96 hours for their on-drug QTc determination. If the on-therapy QTc is 500 ms or greater or the patient self-identified as a QTc reactor with a DQTc of 60 ms or greater, then the QTc countermeasures need to be reexamined or the medications stopped in an effort to neutralize the increased potential for DI-TdP and DI-SCD (Figure 1 ).",

Otherwise, patients will receive a red light signal inappropriately, resulting in therapy delay, discontinuation, or avoidance altogether. In this setting, the simplest approach is to maintain the previously indicated QTc green, yellow, and red light thresholds and apply a simple formula to account for the wide QRS complex (wide QRS complexeadjusted QTc \u00bc QTc e [QRS \u00c0 100 ms]). For example, if a patient's left bundle branch block has yielded a QRS complex of 200 ms and a QTc of 520 ms, this scenario would appear to activate the red light pathway (Figure 1) . However, the wide QRS complexeadjusted QTc would be 520 ms e (200 \u00c0 100 ms) \u00bc 520 \u00c0 100 \u00bc 420 ms, which is not red light status at all but rather \"green light go\" status with much QTc reassurance that the patient is at low risk for DI-SCD.",

And if it does, we hope that this simple QTc surveillance strategy, enabled by innovation and the FDA's emergency approval, will help prevent altogether or at least substantially reduce the number of druginduced ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac deaths, particularly if there is widespread adoption and utilization of these medications for COVID-19.
