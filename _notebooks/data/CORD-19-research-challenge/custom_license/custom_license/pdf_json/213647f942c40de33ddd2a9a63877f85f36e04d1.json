On the other hand, we put In order to include potential viral ARTIs and to exclude typical bacterial infections, patients enrolled in the study were selected by physicians according to the following criteria: with respiratory symptoms such as cough or wheezing, acute fever (body temperature \u2265 38 \u2022 C), and normal or low leukocyte count, with or without radiological pulmonary abnormalities. A total of 1791 throat swabs were collected and tested. The information of the subject's age, gender and presence of underlying diseases was collected during a face-to-face interview. Multiple PCR diagnostic kit for simultaneously detecting 12 pathogens of respiratory viruses (Hangzhou Neuro-Hemin Biotech Co., Ltd., China) was used to confirm the pathogen. The clinical features of the disease were closely monitored and summarized. Epidata software was used to store the dataset.",

Among the co-infected cases, multiple (\u22652) respiratory viruses were observed in 31 cases (31/1791, 1.73%). Dual infections were present in 27 patients (27/1791, 1.51%), from which adenoviruses (ADVs) were co-detected in 9 cases, influenza viruses A (IFV A) in 7 cases, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in 5 cases, parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) in 4 cases and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in 2 cases, and triple infections in 4 cases (4/1791, 0.22%). All co-infection cases are summarized in Table 1 . Multivariable logistic-regression analysis identified independent risk factors for co-infection in relation to single viral infection: age of more than 50 years (odds ratio, 1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08 to 1.57; p = 0.031), and having an underlying disease (odds ratio, 1.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.44 to 2.01; p = 0.022). These data suggest that being more than 50 years and having and underlying disease are independent risk factors associated with co-infection among outpatients with acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in Beijing. The widespread prevalence of respiratory viral co-infection in the elderly was higher than that in other age groups, and cases with underlying diseases.",
