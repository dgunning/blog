In response, many hospitals have abruptly reduced or eliminated electve surgeries. As the COVID-19 burden on a hospital increases, procedures that improve survival may similarly have to be reduced or eliminated (i.e. semi-electve, urgent, and perhaps some emergent operatons). For some cancer patents, surgery may be delayed for months, or even years without negatve conseEquences. However, in other scenarios, failure to perform an indicated cancer surgery in tmely fashion may have long term implicatons on a patent's survivorship or signifcant permanent defcits in their Equality of life. Therefore, cancer patents and the oncology teams that treat them are likely to face difcult decisions between suboptmal management strategies. Thoracic oncology decisions are further complicated by the fact most of the patents with lung, esophageal and other thoracic malignancies would be considered to be a \"high risk\" group for poor outcomes with COVID-19 (advanced age, emphysema, heart disease). Further, the indicated therapeutc procedures can both impair lung functon (i.e. lung isolaton, removal of lung tssue), and expose clinical teams to aerosoliied viral load (bronchoscopy, double-lumen endotracheal tube placement , airway surgery, laparoscopy and possibly lung surgery partcularly with parenchymal lung leaks). We have assembled a document to ofer guidance, intended to facilitate these difcult decisions when caring for patents with thoracic malignancies during the COVID-19 pandemic (Table 1) .",
