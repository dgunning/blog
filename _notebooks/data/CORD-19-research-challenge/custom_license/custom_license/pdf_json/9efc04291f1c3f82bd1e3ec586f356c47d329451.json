Therefore, the 78 patients were divided into a general and a severe group, and separate data analysis was conducted for each group.

When compared with the cases who were not treated with corticosteroids, the authors concluded that the administration of corticosteroids was associated with delayed viral clearance. Unlike in the study reporting on MERS, the patients enrolled in the present study exhibited an improved health status. Even in patients in the severe group, the SOFA score on the first day of admission was much lower than that of patients with MERS [2.0 (IQR, 0-2.8) vs. 9.0 (IQR, 6.0-12.0)] (5).",

An observational study by Cao on influenza A (H7N9) viral pneumonia has demonstrated that high doses of corticosteroids (>150 mg/d methylprednisolone) are associated with increased risks of mortality and delayed viral clearance, while there was no difference between patients in the low-dose group (25-150 mg/d methylprednisolone) and controls(6). In the present study, all 25 patients were treated with low-dose corticosteroids, and the conclusions were similar to those of Cao.In another retrospective observational study reporting on patients with MERS who were critically-ill, nearly half of the enrolled patients received low-dose corticosteroids [median hydrocortisone-equivalent dose, 300.0 mg/day (IQR,",
