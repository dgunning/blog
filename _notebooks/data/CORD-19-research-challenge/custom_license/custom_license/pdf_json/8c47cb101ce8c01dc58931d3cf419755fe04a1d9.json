            "text": "In the period up to 2017, the model simulates four types of HIV testing: testing in the general population, testing in antenatal clinics, testing in HIV-positive individuals who experience opportunistic infections, and testing in individuals who receive pre-exposure prophylaxis. The modelling of these modes of testing has been described previously. 3 In the period from 2018 to 2028, we consider a fifth type of testing: testing through mobile clinics. Although this could be considered a variation of testing in the general population, it is likely that the age-and sex profile of patients reached through a multi-disease screening intervention would be different from that achieved in HIV screening programmes. 9 The average annual fraction of the population reached by mobile testing is multiplied by age-and sex-specific adjustment factors, shown in Table S1 . These assumptions are derived using data from a multi-disease screening programme in Uganda, which found relatively high rates of screening uptake in women and older adults. 10 The average annual proportion of the adult population (aged 15 and older) screened was set to 10%. Estimates of uptake of mobile testing services from population-based studies are very inconsistent. Labhardt et al found that in Lesotho, 1392 individuals participated in a mobile multi-disease screening programme in 6 communities, over 1 month. 11 The median community size was 4909, and these data therefore suggest an uptake rate of 4.7% (1392/(6 \u00d7 4909)). However, Chamie et al found a substantially higher rate of uptake when a similar mobile multidisease screening programme was introduced in Uganda, with 63% uptake over a 5-day period. 10 It is possible that this high rate of uptake was achieved as a result of significant prior community mobilization. Other studies have investigated the uptake of HIV testing when offered through mobile services on a continuous basis, rather than as part of a once-off campaign. Kranzer et al found that in a Cape Town community of approximately 12 520 adults, 922 received mobile HIV testing over a 16-month period, 12 suggesting an annual screening rate of 0.055 ((12/16) \u00d7 922/1250). Higher rates of HIV testing were found in the Accept trial, which involved mobile testing services in conjunction with community mobilization, in Tanzania and Zimbabwe. 13 In Tanzania, 2810 individuals were tested in a population of 6250 individuals over 37 months, while in Zimbabwe, 5911 individuals were tested in a population of 10700 individuals over 42 months. These data suggest annual testing rates of 0.15 and 0.16 respectively.",

            "text": "A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the potential effect of increasing the assumed rates of linkage to treatment services following diagnosis to 81% (for all three diseases). Although studies in sub-Saharan Africa have generally found low rates of linkage to care following diagnosis in mobile screening programmes, 14, [17] [18] [19] one South African study found that 86% of ART-eligible individuals diagnosed through a home-based screening programme started ART within 3 months of diagnosis if the newly-diagnosed individuals were followed up regularly and provided with counselling on HIV care. 20 High rates of treatment uptake are therefore possible with good follow-up and counselling. Table S3 summarizes the results of the sensitivity analysis, and Figure S1 shows the expected yields on the multi-disease screening programme in the sensitivity analysis. The higher assumed rates of linkage are associated with substantially increased numbers of newly-treated individuals, relative to those predicted in the main analysis. For example, there are twice as many newlytreated HIV-positive adults as a result of the multi-disease screening programme than predicted in the main analysis. However, the number of infections averted is less than double in the sensitivity analysis because high levels of HIV diagnosis have already been achieved in South Africa, and thus the marginal gains from further increases in HIV testing and linkage to care in newly-diagnosed individuals are modest. The model conservatively assumes that individuals who have previously been diagnosed HIV-positive do not initiate ART at a higher rate if they test positive again. A limitation of the model is that it does not consider the possibility that individuals who were previously diagnosed (whether for HIV, diabetes or hypertension) and did not initiate treatment at diagnosis may be more likely to initiate treatment if they test positive again.",

However, the number of newly treated HIV cases and the number of HIV infections averted is more than half that in the main analysis, which is a reflection of the saturation effects that may be expected when levels of HIV diagnosis are already high (i.e. the marginal returns to increased frequency of testing diminish as the background rates of HIV diagnosis increase).

In the case of HIV, which is conventionally diagnosed using two rapid tests, specificity is generally close to 100% and false positives are consequently uncommon. 21 However, in the case of hypertension and diabetes, the tests that are commonly used in community-based testing campaigns typically have poor specificity and sensitivity. 22, 23 The use of more accurate testing is not feasible in the context of a mobile testing campaign: in the case of diabetes, the gold standard diagnosis requires an 8-hour fast prior to receiving a 75g sugar dose, followed 2 hours later by a blood measurement; 22 in the case of hypertension, the gold standard diagnosis requires several measurements at different times, ideally outside of a clinic setting. 23 Because the diagnostic criteria we have assumed (HbA1c\u22656.5% in the case of diabetes and a single systolic blood pressure measurement \u2265140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure measurement \u226590 mmHg in the case of hypertension) may have poor sensitivity, 22 , 23 the campaigns we have modelled are likely to miss many cases of undiagnosed disease. In addition, the poor specificity of these screening methods may lead to substantial over-diagnosis, i.e. the yields from multi-disease screening (% prevalence of disease and % newly diagnosed in Figure  14b of the main text) may be exaggerated. However, it is important to note that the South African study on which we base our assumptions about treatment initiation after diagnosis considers individuals treated only if they have received repeat testing at a health facility (to confirm the initial diagnosis), 17 and thus the fraction newly treated in Figure 14b of the main text is unlikely to be overstated (unless there remains substantial over-diagnosis even after the confirmatory testing). In this study, the positive predictive value of the initial diagnosis can be conservatively estimated as the fraction of those receiving a repeat test who subsequently started treatment: 67% in the case of diabetes and 69% in the case of hypertension (the estimates are conservative because many of those who fail to initiate treatment do so for reasons other than a negative repeat test). This implies that the true fraction newly diagnosed could be as low as 1.7% in the case of diabetes (2.6% \u00d7 0.67) and 9.6% in the case of hypertension (13.9% \u00d7 0.69). ",

Pre-diabetes was defined as random blood glucose 7-11 mmol/L (126-196 mg/DL) and diabetes was defined as random blood glucose \u02c311 mmol/L (196 mg/DL). 6 In sensitivity analyses we examined the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of these tests. Compared hypertension based on ambulatory blood pressure of 135/85 mm Hg (i.e., repeated measures over the course of a day), clinical measurement with a threshold of 140/90 mm Hg had mean sensitivity of 75% and mean specificity of 75% in meta-analyses. 7 For diagnosis of diabetes and dysglycemia, a threshold of 7.2 mmol/L for random blood glucose (slightly higher than we assumed) has sensitivity of 63% and specificity of 87% compared to oral glucose tolerance test. 8 These estimates indicate that 25% of participants with hypertension would not be identified and 37% of participants with diabetes or dysglycemia would not be identified. In sensitivity analyses accounting for these missed diagnoses we adjusted the NCD care cascade estimates ( Figure 5 ). In the 2018 intervention communities following screening, we estimate 443,000 individuals with hypertension not on treatment would be identified, with the percent of hypertensive individuals with a diagnosis increasing to 79% and with 22% receiving medication (versus 94% and 27% without false-negatives). In the intervention communities 40,000 individuals with diabetes would be newly diagnosed, with the percent of individuals with diabetes or dysglycemia increasing to 66% with 33% receiving medication (versus 92% and 47% without false-negatives). We expect that individuals with false-negative screening results may be identified as having hypertension or diabetes if and when they initiated clinical care or in subsequent rounds of community-based testing or during other health care encounters. In regards to community-based screening costs, the 25% reduction in the number of individuals with hypertension or diabetes would correspond to a 33% increase in the cost per true positive diagnosed. We estimate the marginal cost per case identified would be $57 for that blood glucose screening if provided in conjunction with the HIV community health campaign, and this cost is jointly shared by hypertension screening.",

Although there will be substantial false-positive test results for both hypertension and diabetes, many of these individuals may be at increased risk of these chronic conditions and may benefit from clinical encounters and education about lifestyle impacts. For positive screening results for both of these conditions, fuller workups may be warranted, and repeated screening with the same or different tests may be appropriate, including ambulatory blood pressure and HbA1c screening or oral glucose tolerance. We expect that many individuals with false-positive test results (i.e., misdiagnosed with hypertension or diabetes) would be identified as such if and when they initiated clinical care, albeit at some health care cost. The proportion of incorrect test results may be reduced through two-stage screening or the use of screening tests with higher sensitivity and specificity, as they become more affordable and more widely available.

This corresponds to a 54% (60%*81%) and an 81% (90%*81%) reduction in the unmet need for ART among HIV-positive MSM and FSW accordingly ( Figure 6 ). We modeled this effect as a linear increase in rate of ART coverage from 2018 to 2023, using an extended version of the Spectrum AIM module. In sensitivity analysis, we reduced the expected level of ART uptake to 40%, in line with assumptions in the South African model, and studies the impact of this change on projected epidemiological outcomes. Furthermore, in order to estimate potential impact of PrEP, we modeled two additional scenarios for implementation of oral PrEP among MSM and FSW at low (10%) and high (30%) levels of coverage. In these scenarios, PrEP coverage was increased linearly from 2018 to 2023 (continued at fixed levels through 2028), and PrEP adherence was assumed at 50% for those on PrEP.",

The costs of these resources are derived from the literature, from the Spectrum model, and from the ImpactNow family planning module. Health care utilization: The Spectrum models estimate the number of people on ART each year, and person-year costs for ART in each country are applied to these estimates. For hypertension and diabetes in Kenya, the numbers of people newly receiving treatment are based on country-specific treatment rates. For HIV and STI treatment costs and effectiveness, we consider a tenyear time horizon (reporting each value in the year in which it occurs). By contrast, for hypertension, we consider a lifetime time horizon for both costs and DALYs, as much of the medical resource consumption and DALYs averted will occur after 2028. All lifetime costs and DALYs are discounted at 3% annually. For diabetes we could not identify per-case estimates of lifetime treatment costs and instead present costs per DALY averted based on population-level modeling. 1 We limit our economic evaluation to a narrow scope of direct resource requirements plus healthcare utilization, reflecting the limited evidence base on integrated HIV interventions and a desire for transparency in this simplified analysis. As such, we adopt a healthcare perspective for these analyses and do not incorporate costs to clients, impacts on productivity, additional costs of health systems strengthening, or utilization of other services or other societal outcomes. Our estimates of costeffectiveness may therefore be conservatively biased (to the extent that additional gains to society outweigh the additional costs). Health systems strengthening is necessary for delivery of these interventions and to respond to the health care demands they create.",

PWID enter due to injecting initiation and exit due to cessation of injecting or death (overdose, HIV-related death, or non-HIV background mortality). Individuals can cycle on and off a harm reduction intervention ( Figure S2 ), which is defined differently for each scenario (recruited at a rate \u03b7, drop-out at a rate \u03b6). The harm reduction scenarios explore scaleup of: high coverage needle/syringe program (NSP) only (defined as receiving one or more sterile syringes per injection), OAT only, or a combined NSP and OAT program (in other words, PWID are recruited onto a program providing both high coverage NSP and OAT). For each harm reduction scenario, the harm reduction intervention is assumed to reduce an individual's risk of injecting HIV transmission compared to those no on harm reduction by RR k . Therefore, RR 0 =1, and RR k varies depending on intervention examined (NSP, OAT, or NSP+OAT). Hence, we assume NSP, OAT, and NSP+OAT reduce an individual's risk of injecting HIV transmission compared to no NSP (cofactors RR NSP, RR OAT , and RR BOTH, respectively). We also assume OAT (alone or in combination with NSP) reduces the risk of ART drop out compared to those not on OAT by 23% (cofactor \u03c8 k where by definition \u03c8 0 =1, and \u03c8 k varies by intervention, such that \u03c8 NSP =1 and \u03c8 OAT = \u03c8 BOTH =mean 0.77 ), and risk of fatal overdose by 71%",

We additionally incorporate a heightened risk of overdose in the first 4 weeks entering or leaving OAT based on data from a systematic-review and meta-analysis. Hence, we incorporate death for a small proportion of those entering OAT (proportion m enter ) , where m enter = \u03bc 1 x OD prev x (RR ODonOAT -1) x (4/52) . Here, \u03bc 1 is the background overdose mortality rate, OD prev is the protective overdose prevention benefit while being on OAT, and RR OD is the risk of overdose within the first four weeks of initiating methadone. We multiply all of this by the duration at risk which is 4 weeks / 52 weeks per year. Similarly, when coming off the intervention, we incorporate death for a small proportion of those exiting OAT ( m exit ) where m exit = \u03bc 1 x (RR ODoffOAT -1)",

Thus, as a sensitivity analysis, we assumed that 25% of PWID would never access the harm reduction intervention, while still maintaining the same coverage. Results are shown in Figure S5 . Overall, the relative change in the proportion of HIV cases and fatal overdoses averted was affected minimally (<15%). The relative change from the baseline scenarios was approximately 8% for all scenarios in this sensitivity analysis. Similar findings were observed with respect to overdose averted, with the largest relative change found in the 25% OAT scenario (15% in sensitivity analysis versus 17% in the baseline, -11% relative change).

Expansion of ART services has a significant impact on number of new infections among MSM, resulting in a 34% reduction over the next decade. Provision of PrEP at 10% or 30% coverage alone can not achieve similar results. However, combination of PrEP and ART can further reduce the HIV incidence among MSM by 46% at 30% PrEP coverage (blue line). Given the projected rapid decline in HIV incidence among FSW at baseline (black line), the interventions achieve smaller reductions in terms of HIV incidence. This is mainly driven by the underlying reduction in HIV prevalence among FSW in India, resulting in a small force of infection and therefore, limiting the impact of interventions for averting future transmissions. At a national level, expansion of ART services among FSW and MSM alone can reduce the number of new transmissions among the male and female population by 7% -corresponding to 51,250 new infections averted.",

The HIV stages are characterized by an initial high viraemia phase of acute infection (average duration 1/\u03b3), a longer latent phase of low viraemia (average duration 1/\u03ba), a short phase of high viraemia pre-AIDS (average duration 1/\u03c4), and a short phase of AIDS where we assume PWID are too ill to contribute to HIV transmission (average duration 1/\u03b8). Due to higher viraemia levels, those in the acute and pre-AIDS stages have heightened sexual and injecting transmission compared to individuals in the latent phase (cofactors \u03b5 and \u03b9, respectively). PWID can be recruited onto ART once they enter the longer latent ART stage or later, upon which they have a reduced HIV-related death rate (cofactor \u03bd for the latent and pre-AIDS stages, and \u03c1 for the, AIDS stage). We assume individuals on ART have reduced sexual and injecting transmission (cofactors \u03c9 inj and \u03c9 sex for injecting and sexual transmission, respectively). Individuals can drop out of ART, at a rate \u03b4 k, dependent on intervention status and type.Based on multivariable log-binomial regression analyses, the model was stratified by sex and incarceration history in both settings. A certain proportion of individuals (denoted p prisoon ) are high risk (have a history of prison) on entry into injecting (the remainder (1-p prison ) are low-risk with no history of incarceration. PWID can move from low to high risk (become incarcerated) at a rate (r). Being high risk is assumed to change an individual's risk of injecting HIV transmission by a cofactor RR high compared to low risk. Similarly, p sex denotes the proportion of entrants by sex (p sex =p females for females and p sex =(1p females ) for males), and being female alters an individual's risk of injecting HIV transmission by a cofactor RR female compared to males.

We utilized findings from a previously published dynamic coinfection model of HIV and HCV transmission among PWID 18 , which estimated the proportion of HIV transmission due to sexual transmission in various settings with different values of HIV/HCV coinfection prevalences and HIV/HCV prevalence ratios (the overall HIVprevalence divided by the overall HCV prevalence).

Overall, this reduction in the background mortality rate minimally affected the proportion of HIV cases averted in Omsk (<3% relative change), with negligible change in Ekaterinburg.

Minimal changes were observed in the proportion of fatal overdoses averted (<1% across all scenarios). limitations: The model is limited by uncertainty in the underlying parameters. Where possible, we have used local data or Russian data. Where these estimates were unavailable, we utilized estimates from similar regions or low-middle income country settings. To incorporate this uncertainty in the modelprojections we perform a probabilistic uncertainty analysis and propagating this uncertainty in the fitting to the future projections, presenting the model projections in terms of means and 95%CIs. For full discussion of model limitations please see the companion paper. 6 Estimating the cost of NSP provision: A study conducted by the World Bank estimated the cost per needle/syringe exchanged to be $0.38 [in 2017 USD]. The number of PWID in Russia has been estimated to be 1.88 million (1.5-2.2 million) 2 , thus assuming 50% coverage, the number of PWID needed to be covered would be 0.94 million. Behavioral data from in Omsk and Ekaterinburg revealed that daily injection was common. 3 Thus, assuming that one clean syringe is needed per injection per day, then the cost of providing 50% of PWID in Russia would be 0.94 million PWID x $0.38 per clean syringe x 365.25 days = $130,467,300 (range: $104,096,250 -$152,674,500) per year.",

This is especially imperative in the case of health governance, which has a direct impact on people's lives and well-being and is integrally related to the economic and social conditions in which people live.Participatory national health assemblies are potentially transformative vehicles for building broad-based support for health, informing the evolution and functioning of health systems, and creating peoplecentred health systems. Popular health assemblies are a decades-old innovation, but their salience has increased in recent years as a result of growing grassroots energy on health. In Thailand, the National Health Assembly convenes diverse parties to guide health policy-making, including government, civil society, academic experts, health workers and the private sector. In South Africa, a People's Health Assembly led to a call to action to achieve universal, comprehensive health access. [1] Although these national assemblies have their greatest impact at country level, where they are able to influence national approaches to health, they also have the potential to have worldwide impact. Together, participatory national assemblies can aid in the emergence of a genuine, people-powered global movement for health, generating new awareness of the critical role of health in the broader development agenda.",
