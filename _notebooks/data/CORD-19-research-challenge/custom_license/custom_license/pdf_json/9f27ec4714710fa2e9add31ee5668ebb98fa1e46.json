Healthy subjects (n=31) and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, n=21) who had lipid tests in our hospital between September, 2019 to October, 2019 were included as normal and non-COVID-19 controls. Electronic medical records including demographic, clinical treatment, and laboratory data, were extracted.

Table 1 ), whether lipid biogenesis has been impaired is yet to be determined. Second, viral infection induced pro-inflammatory cytokines modulate lipid metabolism including oxidation of LDL by reactive oxygen species singling to facilitate LDL clearance [11] [12] [13] . A measurement of oxidized LDL in patient's serum will aid in determining this mechanism. Third, COVID-19 patients may have an increased vascular permeability caused by viral-induced inflammation. Exudates have been found evidently in the early phase of COVID-19 lung pathology [8] . Exudative fluids, containing high levels of protein and cholesterol, are caused by inflammation-related vascular permeability [14, 15] , which may be one possible mechanism underlying our data. The major limitations of this study include a small size of patients and lack of information of specific lipoproteins and oxidized LDLs. Another limitation is Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 8 lack of a data set with lipids monitoring on a hospitalized non-COVID-19 disease group to further address the specificity between LDL levels and COVID-19 severity. We also posit that the dyslipidemia plays an important role in pathological development of COVID-19, which mechanism needs an urgent investigation. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that LDL decrease is associated with pathological course of COVID-19, which can serve a factor to access the disease progression and mortality. ",
