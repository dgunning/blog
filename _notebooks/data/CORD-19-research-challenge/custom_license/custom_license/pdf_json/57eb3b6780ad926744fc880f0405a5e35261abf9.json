However, the false negative rate of nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2 with throat swabs is high, and throat swabs are uncomfortable for patients, and may induce coughing. The lingual swab is convenient and may achieve the same effect. This study compares the differences between lingual swab and throat swab sampling results, and analyzes whether standardized sampling by the same nurse could improve the detection rate compared with sampling by several nurses.",

Zhongnan Hospital is one of the largest hospitals in the area, and has admitted a large number of COVID-19 patients [3, 4] . Two groups of consented patients were sampled using both sampling methods; all swabs were tested using a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for SARS-CoV-2. The first group contained 46 patients, who were from fever clinic of Wuhan No.7 Hospital (a COVID-19 fixed-point hospital). This group of patients was sampled by the same experienced, who used a standardized sampling method. Of these patients, 54.3% (25/ 46) were positive by RT-PCR; 54.3% (25/46) tested positive on throat swabs and 36.9% (17/46) were positive on lingual swabs; all patients with positive lingual swabs also had positive throat swabs. In another group, 45 patients from the fever clinic of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University were also sampled by using both methods, but this group of patients was sampled by several nurses. 48.9% (22/45) were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR. However this time 33.3% (15/45) tested positive on throat swabs and 35.6% (16/45) on lingual swabs; only 45.5% (10/22) of the positive patients were detected by both methods (Table 1 ).",
