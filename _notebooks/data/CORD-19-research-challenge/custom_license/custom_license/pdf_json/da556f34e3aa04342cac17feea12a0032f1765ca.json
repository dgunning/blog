In particular, the performance of routine endoscopy is temporarily suspended, and only emergency endoscopy is allowed in many countries where severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread. We highlight different scenarios in which endoscopy should still be performed urgently in patients with IBD, as well as recommendations regarding the use of personal protective equipment. We suggest a pathway for performing safe endoscopy and discuss the potential risks of postponing endoscopy in IBD. Finally, we propose a post-pandemic plan for access to endoscopy.",

            "text": "Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), leading to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , was declared an official pandemic by WHO on March 11, 2020 , at which point infections had been reported in 114 countries. 1 As of April 1, 2020, there had been 823 626 cases of COVID-19 reported worldwide. 2 COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a RNA virus belonging to the family of Coronaviridae that was first detected in Wuhan, China, in December, 2019. The main symptoms are sore throat, fever, cough, dyspnoea, sputum production, myalgia, fatigue, and headache. 3 Diarrhoea is reported as a COVID-19-associated symptom in 2\u00b70-35\u00b76% of patients, 4 alongside nausea or vomiting (1\u00b70-17\u00b73%). 5 Other atypical symptoms may include loss of sense of smell or taste. The cell entry receptor ACE2 appears to mediate the entry of SARS-CoV-2, and is not only highly expressed in the lung cells, but also throughout the gastrointestinal tract; 6 moreover, ACE2 is important in controlling intestinal inflammation, the disruption of which may lead to diarrhoea. 7 Given the chronic nature of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and the medications used to treat them, there is concern that patients with IBD may be at increased risk of infection or poorer disease course. This, together with the need to alter health-care utilisation during the pandemic, has led to rationing of endoscopic resources in this patient population. However, there are currently no specific endoscopic recommendations for patients affected by IBD based on direct evidence in the midst of the pandemic. Patients with IBD have been recommended to follow the general public health measures outlined by the WHO. 8 Patients with IBD, especially those on systemic corticosteroids, thiopurine, and biologics, are considered to be moderate-to-high risk patients who are susceptible to COVID-19 and its complications. The general strategy expressed by the British Society of Gastro enterology (BSG), the International Organization for the study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IOIBD), the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO), and the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA) is to reduce contact with health-care settings and thus possible exposure to COVID-19: all non-essential endoscopic procedures including colon cancer screening and those for patients with suspected gastrointestinal cancers have been cancelled, as these represent a risk for both patients and health-care personnel in an overstretched healthcare environment. 9, 10 Only emergency endoscopies are permitted. 11 Therefore, before carrying out a diagnostic or therapeutic endoscopic examination in patients with IBD, the risks and benefits of performing the endoscopic procedure should be considered. It is important to ensure that the procedure is necessary and urgent. Candidate patients should be carefully selected, weighing the risks of transmission for patients and health-care professionals, and of making a trained endoscopy team available.",

Of note, the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed in the USA reported a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting on admission to hospital and then passed two loose bowel movements. 13 In a study from China, 103 (50\u00b75%) of 204 patients presented with gastrointestinal symptoms, including anorexia, diarrhoea, and vomiting. 15 If a patient has gastrointestinal symptoms that precede or follow fever, fatigue, and dry cough, a throat swab for SARS-CoV-2 should be performed to rule out infection.

For differential diagnosis of IBS and to discriminate it from patients with IBD, assessment of clinical and biochemical features is fundamental. Faecal calprotectin should be requested, since it seems to be the most sensitive marker of intestinal inflammation in IBD; a cutoff of 150 \u00b5g/g (or alternative recommended thresholds for laboratory-based or point-of-care or home testing kits) discriminates between IBS and IBD. 18 The operational characteristics of faecal calprotectin in the scenario of COVID-19 are unclear and the virus may be shed in stool, which should be taken into consideration before requesting this test.

Blood tests could be non-specific because an increase in inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein and ferritin may occur in either disease, though occasionally ferritin levels can be low in ulcerative colitis. Patients with COVID-19 could have leucopenia (particularly lymphopenia) and thrombo cytopenia, 21 while patients with a flare-up of ulcerative colitis usually have normal or higher than normal leucocytes and lymphocytes and increased platelet count. If patients also present with respiratory symptoms (eg, cough, dyspnoea), or myalgia or fatigue, 3 or they had contact with SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, or have travelled from areas deemed to be of high risk for COVID-19 in the previous 14 days, a chest CT scan, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection in the respiratory tract with a nasopharyngeal swab, 22 or both, should be done to screen for infection. In all cases, standard stool tests should be done for intestinal bacteria (Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, entero patho genic and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli) and for C difficile toxin, and a blood test for cytomegalovirus DNA should also be done to allow differential diagnosis with other causes of diarrhoea. 20 Once the diagnosis of an acute severe flare-up of ulcerative colitis is considered likely and if the patient has not had a colonoscopy in the past 3 months, a flexible sigmoidoscopy (at a minimum) should be done to confirm the clinical suspicion, to define the extent (left sided or more extensive), and to take biopsies to rule out the presence of other infections (eg, cytomegalovirus). 23, 24 Even in a pandemic situation, a baseline endoscopy is important to be able to start potentially high-risk therapy with conviction. If a patient has had a recent colonoscopy within the past 3 months that showed moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (Mayo endoscopic score 2-3), omission of flexible sigmoidoscopy might be left to the discretion of the gastroenterologist, given the risks presented by endoscopy during the pandemic, and to simply use the baseline panel of investigations described above to rule out infectious causes. One should note that elevated cytomegalovirus DNA titres, following discussion with colleagues in infectious disease, should always mandate flexible sigmoidoscopy.",

The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE), the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE), and the BSG consider gastrointestinal obstruction needing urgent decompression or stenting to be among the procedures that should still be done during the pandemic. 11 Obstructive strictures in patients with IBD are commonly accompanied by nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and abdominal pain, and require rapid medical, endoscopic, or surgical intervention. 27 A patient with ulcerative colitis presenting with partial obstructive symptoms is of particular concern since this is highly suggestive of a new colorectal cancer. These patients should be a high priority for colonoscopy with minimal preparation for diagnosis by colonoscopy and biopsies. The operator may consider temporary stenting or balloon dilatation if surgery has to be postponed. However, cross-sectional imaging is more worthwhile in patients with Crohn's disease with partial obstructive symptoms, and endoscopy should be avoided if possible. Nevertheless, in patients known to have post-operative ileocolonic stricture requiring periodic endoscopic balloon dilatation, colono scopy might be urgently necessary if these patients present with increasing subacute obstructive episodes. Medical treatment might alleviate a stricture with a predominantly inflammatory component, but 40% of patients might require urgent surgery for malignancy or benign stricture, 28 which could be challenging in the pandemic situation. Patients under programmed sessions of endoscopic dilatations for strictures should not have these sessions deferred, since these patients might otherwise end up being hospitalised.",

This classification was initially created for patients with any condition that required endoscopy and at the beginning of the outbreak, when routine endoscopy was allowed; however routine endoscopy has now been discontinued in many hospitals. Therefore, all patients, including those with IBD, should be considered as high-risk patients before undergoing urgent endoscopy. Risk should be determined on the basis of a chest CT scan, SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing of nasopharyngeal swab, or both, to rule out infection, and results should be double-checked. We recommend a careful evaluation of patients before their entry to the endoscopic unit. Negative swab tests for patients with a high index of suspicion for COVID-19 may need to be retested before admittance, depending on local guidance.",
