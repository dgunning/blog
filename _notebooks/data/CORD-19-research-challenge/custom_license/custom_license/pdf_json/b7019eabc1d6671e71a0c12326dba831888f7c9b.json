This virus was associated with acute respiratory disease in the 39-year-old male index patient and also somewhat later in two of his family members (Chua et al., 2007) . Furthermore, 14 out of 109 human volunteers living on the same island as the index patients proved positive for antibodies against Pulau-virus that is closely related with Melaka-virus.",

The RT-PCR detection protocol was kindly provided by Dres. Chua and Wang who initially described Melaka-virus (Chua et al., 2007) .",

No double infections with any of the tested viruses were observed. Melaka-virus RNA was not found in any of the samples tested. Although the lack of a Melakavirus RNA positive sample does not imply that it is absent in our clinical samples since it could have been below the detection limit of the RT-PCR assay, we can still conclude that Melaka-virus plays no or only a minor role in hospitalized European pediatric patients. This conclusion is based upon the negative RT-PCR results. In similar epidemiological studies that we have performed for other viruses, the phenomenon that a newly described virus was not found in patient populations with corresponding symptoms was not observed. In other words, following the first descriptions of HMPV, human Bocavirus, Coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1, at least a small percentage of patients turned out to be infected by these new viruses (Kupfer et al., 2006; Muller et al., 2007; Volz et al., 2007; Wilkesmann et al., 2006) contributing to the common cold. In contrast, no positive results were obtained for Melaka-virus which is suspected to be transmitted by bats as a zoonotic pathogen.",

We finally conclude that Melaka-virus testing should preferably be carried out in populations with suspected contact to the virus such as inhabitants of the endemic regions or air travellers with symptoms of respiratory disease (Luna et al., 2007) .",
