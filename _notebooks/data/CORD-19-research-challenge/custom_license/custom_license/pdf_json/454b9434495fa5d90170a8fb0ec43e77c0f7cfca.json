Learning from the experience of SARS, Singapore promptly established a multi-ministerial task force, co-chaired by the Minister of Health, that included representatives from the Ministries of Home Affairs, Social and Family, Transport, Education, Manpower, Trade and Industry, Communication and Information, Environment and Water Resources, and the labor movement, to coordinate a whole of government response and protect public health [1] . Singapore's response to the COVID-19 outbreak has been well documented to date [2] . Some of the core dimensions are outlined below. Strong disease surveillance systems have been utilized to identify potential cases and extensive contact tracing has enabled the identification of close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases. The government has strictly enforced quarantine and containment measures, in addition to border controls, to contain COVID-19. Testing capacity was rapidly increased with free testing for suspected cases. To reduce potential barriers of seeking treatment, the Singapore government has adopted financing measures to pay for the direct costs of inpatient healthcare for suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 for Singapore residents.",

Approximately 70% of the newly diagnosed patients are admitted for medical stabilization using admission criteria outlined in published international guidelines [4] . The majority (64%) are admitted for bradycardia. The service also provides continuing outpatient care which is led by a team of Family Based Treatment (FBT)-trained psychologists with regular team case review and input from other specialties as required.
