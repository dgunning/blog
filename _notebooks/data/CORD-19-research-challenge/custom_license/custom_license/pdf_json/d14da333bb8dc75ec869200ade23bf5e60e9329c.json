In Europe, Italy has faced this novel disease entity (named COVID-19) first and severely. COVID-19 represents a significant hurdle for public health services and a potential harm for patients with cancer. The Collegio Italiano dei Primari Oncologi Medici (CIPOMO) is an Italian association of head physicians in oncology departments, which promotes working and research activities in oncology on a national basis. In the midst of the epidemic in Italy, the CIPOMO promoted a national survey aiming to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on clinical activity of oncologists and the implementation of containment measures of COVID-19 diffusion. Overall, 122 head physicians participated in this survey, with a homogeneous distribution on the national territory. Results show that the following measures for oncologic patients have been promptly implemented through the whole country: use of protective devices, triage of patients accessing the hospital, delay of non-urgent visits, and use of telemedicine. Results of this survey suggest that Italian oncology departments have promptly set a proactive approach to the actual emergency. Oncologists need to preserve the continuum of care of patients, as the benefit of ensuring a well-delivered anti-cancer treatment plan outweighs the risk of COVID-19 infection. International cooperation is an important starting point, as heavily affected",

By the end of February 2020, Italy was experiencing the rapid spread of the virus, which started to affect the North of the Country with a daily increase in the number of cases and consequent deaths [2] . In Italy, data regarding the diffusion of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2 confirmed its higher lethality compared to that observed in China and worldwide (9% vs 4.3%) [3] . Following the Chinese model, containment measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 in Italy have been promptly activated and implemented. The first national decree, issued on March 8 th , instituted a containment zone concerning the most affected areas of the Country (the so-called Red Zone, which at that time included 3 regions in the North of Italy: Lombardia, Emilia Romagna, and Veneto). In the following days, a series of decrees have extended increasingly strict measures to the whole national territory. The main provisions included: forbidding all gatherings of people; restricting movements of people within and outside the hometown, except for circumstances of necessity; encouraging employees to work from home. In this circumstance, health workers cannot take any leave, and are asked to suspend all non-urgent activities. All planned surgeries are postponed, to give over intensive care beds to the treatment of patients with COVID-19, and hospitals had to create new intensive care places by converting operating and anesthetic rooms. This pandemic represents a significant harm for patients with cancer, who are at high risk of infections due to several predisposing factors [4] . Moreover, most treatment procedures in oncology cannot be delayed without compromising the efficacy of treatment itself. In Italy, specific indications on oncologic patients' management were given on March 10 th , mainly regarding caution measures to reduce the risk of infection (i.e. use of personal protective equipment, practice social distancing). While encouraging physicians to postpone follow up visits, indications were given to guarantee oncologic services even within the Red Zone, in order to maintain the continuum of care.",

Such measures consisted mainly in delaying visits not considered to be urgent (i.e. patients in follow up after surgery and/or radiotherapy, and/or patients with breast cancer receiving adjuvant hormonal treatment after surgery), even more so if the patients presented risk factors (i.e. age > 85 years, presence of comorbidities). Alternative ways to get in touch with patients have been widely used: most patients underwent telephonic interviews with interpretation of laboratory and radiologic exams report, while in other cases family doctors were delegated to inspect the results of follow up exams. Access to oncologic structures was likewise limited and/or denied for visitors and caregivers, either for outpatient visits, day hospital and ward admissions.",

However, by that time most oncologic units had already activated measures to contain accesses, under regional or internal (hospital Medical Direction) orders. As so, more than 50% of oncologic structures did not have to modify the measures they implemented to reduce the risk of infections, in view of the actual legislation. Due to such measures, more than 20% of structures had reported a significant reduction in their routine activity, while 60% had only a negligible reduction and 9% had not substantially changed their activity.",

Twenty-four percent of Italian oncology departments had at least one patient diagnosed with COVID-19, with a higher rate in the Red Zone (46%) and no diagnosis at all in the South of Italy and in islands. Examining reports from the Red Zone, it emerges that most patients accessed Emergency Room presenting with fever and/or respiratory symptoms (23%), while a significant proportion of patients was diagnosed after a triage procedure (18%) and/or a medical interview regarding possible contacts with subjects at risk (18%).

Some effective points emerge from this survey, which partly have been also raised in the comment recently released by the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) [7] . First, oncologists face the need to preserve the continuum of care for most of their patients, as the benefit of ensuring a well-delivered anti-cancer treatment plan outweighs the risk of COVID-19 infection. However, the risk from COVID-19 exposure varies significantly from patient to patient, making treatment tailoring important now more than ever. Second, physicians have to get used to a new working activity, which implies the use of tele-consultation services when feasible, and reducing the number of visits by means of customizing treatment delivery (three or two-weekly as opposed to weekly, oral or subcutaneous alternatives as opposed to intravenous administration). Also, in view of a visit a telephonic \"previous day\" triage could help, in order to avoid the access of symptomatic patients to oncologic wards. Third, protection of patients and physicians is paramount in order to keep providing the best service in a safe way.",
