Different pathogens may give rise to similar symptoms, making the aetiological diagnosis important. They are often self-limiting processes, but may present high morbidity and mortality rates, especially in young children or immunosuppressed patients. 1 In developing countries they are associated with poor sanitation, lack of running water and nutritional deficiencies in the population, and present higher morbidity and mortality rates than in developed countries, where they are frequently associated with food-borne infections. 2, 3 The rapid and successful diagnosis of the pathogen involved in the clinical picture is important since some pathogens require a specific treatment; with some it is necessary to use control measures to avoid dissemination, and in some cases knowing the pathogen will enable a decision to be taken as to whether to hospitalise the patient or treat them on an outpatient basis. 1, 4 ",

The most frequently used enzymes are peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase. When the enzyme acts on the substrate, a colorimetric signal will be produced that is visible to the naked eye or quantifiable through the use of a spectrophotometer. In general, the sensitivity and specificity values of these techniques are excellent. They allow simultaneous processing of batches of samples and, in some cases, a quantification of the detected antigen.

In the most common sandwich assays, two zones are distinguished on the strip: the reaction zone, where antibodies against the test antigen are immobilised, and the control zone, where anti-conjugated antibodies are immobilised. The conjugate is an antibody, specific to the test antigen, labelled with a colloidal gold molecule or with coloured polystyrene microspheres. If the antigen is present in the sample, it will bind to both the conjugated antibody and the capture antibody immobilised in the reaction zone. The excess conjugated antibody will continue to migrate through the membrane until it is retained in the control zone. In negative samples, only the control zone will be coloured, whereas if the sample is positive, both the control and reaction zones will be coloured. 5 These are qualitative techniques, very fast and simple to perform, which do not require special laboratory equipment and the samples are processed individually. Most present high values of sensitivity and specificity, although generally lower than those presented by conventional ELISA techniques. Latex agglutination techniques They are based on the use of latex particles bound to the crystallisable fragment (Fc) of immunoglobulins. The antigen-binding fragments (Fab) are exposed and capable of binding to the antigen found in the sample. When the antibodies bind to the antigen, a lattice of the latex particles is produced which results in visible agglutination. These types of techniques require the specimens to be processed individually, are easy to perform, fast and do not require special equipment. However, cross reactions may occur with other sample antigens or prozone phenomena, in which an excess of antibodies prevents the formation of the framework.",

To increase the diagnostic yield, it is necessary to use concentration techniques and, in some cases, specific stains. These determinations only permit the diagnosis of the acute and patent infection, require the taking of serial samples, are very laborious, require specialised personnel and present limitations in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Screening tests for parasitic antigens in faeces use specific antibodies that recognise secretion, surface, or wall molecules of parasites. 7 There are commercialised systems that allow for the simultaneous detection of 2 or 3 different species ( Table 2 ). The amplification tests of genomic sequences are those of greater sensitivity and specificity, and thanks to the constant characterisation of genomes of different organisms, it is possible to design PCR protocols for each of the parasites of interest. However, by using these techniques only one or a few parasites can be detected at a time and there are very few marketed. 8 ",

The traditional diagnosis of amoebiasis has been based for many years on microscopy. However, microscopic techniques do not differentiate E. histolytica from the commensal amoebae Entamoeba dispar and Entamoeba moshkovskii. PCR techniques, based mostly on the amplification of coding regions of the small 18S ribosomal subunit (18S rRNA), differentiate the 3 species of morphologically indistinguishable Entamoeba and present excellent levels of sensitivity and specificity. 9 On the other hand, the detection of E. histolytica antigens by ELISA is a good option if molecular methods are not available. Currently, different membrane EIAs and marketed ICT assays are available that detect E. histolytica-specific antigens in faeces and in abscess content. 10, 11 These assays are based on the detection of specific epitopes of amoebic lectin and have a sensitivity higher than that of microscopic examination. 10, 12 Some of the marketed assays only allow recent or frozen stools to be used. Giardia lamblia Giardiasis, caused by Giardia lamblia, is a parasitic disease of great epidemiological and clinical importance due to its high prevalence and pathogenicity, mainly among children. Various methods of antigen detection with sensitivity and specificity levels superior to those of microscopic examination have been marketed for diagnosis. These tests are also useful in screening the infant population and as a treatment control to confirm healing. The various EIAs marketed use monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies to detect G. lamblia-membrane antigens such as GSA 65 or CWP1. 11 They are rapid techniques, which are cost-effective and allow for the processing of recent stools or faeces preserved in formalin. For G. lamblia commercially available ICT assays are also available. However, most require using fresh or frozen stools, without preservatives, and have a lower sensitivity than ELISA assays. Direct immunofluorescence (DFI) stains for G. lamblia using a GSA 65 antigen-specific monoclonal antibody are also available.",

The diagnosis of some cestodes is based on the observation of proglottids or segments. However, in most helminth infections, diagnosis is made by microscopic identification of their eggs or larvae in the patient's stool. Although there are also special techniques, valid only for certain helminths, such as the Graham ribbon in the diagnosis of Enterobius vermicularis or the cultivation of Strongyloides stercoralis, advances in the rapid diagnosis of intestinal helminths are not as significant as in protozoa. Antigen detection tests have not been highly developed and, although several studies have been published, 14 they have not yet been marketed. More frequent are the serological tests of specific antibodies, available for the diagnosis of hydatidosis, cysticercosis, fasciolosis, schistosomiasis, toxocariasis, anisakiasis, filariasis and strongyloidiasis. Some of these assays have been marketed, while others are only carried out at reference centres. They all have the drawback of not distinguishing between current and past infection, so they are more useful in non-endemic areas, and often have crossreactivity problems 15, 16 As for the molecular diagnosis, a multitude of PCR protocols have been designed, both conventional and realtime, for the diagnosis of helminthiasis. 8 However, so far none has been marketed.",

According to the antigenic characteristics of the VP6 glycoprotein, a component of the internal virion capsid, 8 serogroups (A-H) are distinguished. Human infections are mainly produced by rotavirus serogroup A and, to a lesser extent, by serogroups B and C. The VP4 protein, which constitutes the virion spicules, and the VP7 glycoprotein, constituent of the outer capsid, determine the existence of the serotypes P and G, respectively. 17 The diagnosis of serogroup A rotavirus infections is based on the detection of viral antigens in stool samples, specifically the VP6 glycoprotein. At the moment there are no commercially available methods to detect rotavirus from other serogroups. The formats available are highly varied: ELISA, membrane EIA, ICT and latex agglutination. [18] [19] [20] The membrane EIA, the ICT techniques and latex agglutination are suitable methods for hospitals with few or sporadic samples. However, they are less sensitive than conventional ELISAs. The more sensitive and specific molecular methods are based on an RT-PCR. For the diagnosis of group A rotavirus by RT-PCR, marketed systems use specific primers of the gene encoding the NSP3 non-structural protein. This methodology also allows the detection of rotavirus of different serogroups. 21",

There are numerous commercial EIA tests for the detection of toxins A, B or both. It is recommended to use EIA techniques that detect toxin B or both, because of the producing strains of toxin B. However, these commercial techniques have low sensitivity compared to cell cultures, so nucleic acid detection techniques must be used. 2, 28 The detection of toxin from the isolation obtained by culture should not be used as a single method, since it requires several days to grow, but its use, in addition to the direct detection of toxin, can increase the positivity by 10%. 29 Detection of toxin A/B genes by nucleic acid amplification.

The urease test can be used to identify the bacteria obtained by culture, but it is mainly used as a standard practice in endoscopy units. The first to be marketed for this purpose was the CLO-test, with which positive results were obtained between 30 min and 3 h, although it could be left up to 24 h, which led to a loss of specificity due to other urease positive bacteria. Currently there are different trademarks, which seek to shorten the time to obtain the result. 35 To perform the urea breath test (UBT), the patient ingests marked urea and breath samples are collected before and 30 min after ingestion. If H. pylori is in the stomach, it will hydrolyse the urea and marked CO 2 will be released. A radioactive isotope can be used, 14 C, or a non-radioactive isotope, 13 C, which is the most widely used and can be measured with a mass or infrared spectrometer. 35 It is the non-invasive test of choice for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with H. pylori because of their high sensitivity and specificity (95-100%) to detect active infection. 35, 36 Based on the detection of antibodies. There are numerous serological tests to detect anti-H. pylori IgG antibodies in the patient's serum. The main limitation is that they do not differentiate the active infection from the past infection and the kit used needs to be validated locally. 35 It is useful for epidemiological studies and when there is gastrointestinal bleeding, atrophic gastritis, gastric cancer or MALT lymphoma (mucosa associated lymphoid tissue), since it can produce a low bacterial load in the stomach and will reduce the sensitivity of other diagnostic tests. 36, 37 There are also tests to detect H. pylori antibodies in urine or saliva, with variable results, so it is currently not recommended for use in patient management. 35, 38, 39 Based on the detection of antigens in faeces. The stool antigen test is a non-invasive and qualitative test that detects the H. pylori antigen that has been eliminated in faeces. They can be used: (1) as a test for the initial diagnosis of infection; (2) for treatment control (at least 4 weeks after finishing treatment), and (3) for epidemiological studies.",

Better results are obtained with kits based on EIA in microwell format 39 and are considered equivalent to the UBT in the Maastricht consensus report. 34, 35 There is also an automated chemiluminescent immunoassay with results comparable to the EIA. 34 Sensitivity of 93% and 95% and specificity of 89% and 87% for the pretreatment diagnosis and sensitivity of 94% and 100% and specificity of 97% and 91% for post-treatment follow-up were observed in 2 studies evaluating ICT. 35 In a recent study, 3 commercial ICTs were compared and RAPID Hp StAR (Oxoid) was found to be the most sensitive (91-92%) but less specific (77-85%), whereas for Uni-Gold TM H.pylori Antigen (Trinity Biotech) and for ImmunoCard STAT! HpSA (Meridian), a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 90% (87-89%) were observed. 40 In other studies, lower values of sensitivity and/or specificity have also been observed, therefore it is believed that ICTs need to be improved to be reliable. 40 Based on molecular methods (PCR). For many years, home molecular methods have been used for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection from different samples such as gastric biopsy, faeces, saliva, gastric juice, etc. In addition, they allow for the study of macrolide resistance mutations such as clarithromycin (23S rRNA gene), fluoroquinolones (gyrA gene), tetracyclines (16S rRNA gene), rifabutin (rpoB gene) and amoxicillin (pbp-1a gene), 41, 42 and have the advantages of speed, greater sensitivity than culture with phenotypic methods of antibiotic sensitivity, and they detect heterogeneous resistance, which may be difficult to obtain by culture. 39, 43 In the last Maastricht consensus, sensitivity studies on clarithromycin are considered if this antibiotic is to be used as the first line of treatment in regions with a resistance rate greater than 15%, both by culture and antibiogram, and by a molecular method directly from the biopsy. 36 There are several commercial kits based on real-time PCR that detect H. pylori directly on the biopsy; other methods, in addition to H. pylori, detect the major mutations conferring resistance to clarithromycin [44] [45] [46] [47] (Table 4 ). There is also a commercial kit based on PCR followed by reverse line-blot hybridisation Table 4 Commercial systems using molecular methods for the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori and resistance to clarithromycin or levofloxacin.

Within a short time period, they deliver results of all the pathogens included in the kit and can be a very important tool in some situations, such as in immunosuppressed patients or serious patients. 1 The detection of most pathogens has a good sensitivity and it is highly valuable in the detection of coinfections. 4 There are different commercial techniques to detect gastroenteritis-producing pathogens (Table 5) , and they vary widely in the number and type of pathogens they detect and in the technology they use. 1, 2, 50 Luminex xTAG GPP. It detects bacteria, viruses and parasites. FDA approved and with CE marking, 24 samples can be made in about 5 h in a process that includes: pretreatment, nucleic acid extraction, multiplex PCR, pellet hybridisation, and data analysis. This technique increases the rate of positivity with respect to the conventional methods, and detects mixed infections. 1, 51, 52 FilmArray GI panel (bioM\u00e9rieux). It detects bacteria, parasites and viruses. FDA approved and with EC marking, it consists of a closed device that requires minimal manipulation. The system performs nucleic acid extraction, nested multiplex PCR, and melting temperature analysis. Performing the test along with the analysis takes about 60 min. Higher rates of positivity and a significant percentage of mixed infections are detected, more frequent in children under 5 years or in non-hospitalised patients. The most frequent pathogens in co-infection were Campylobacter and EPEC. 1, 53 Allplex TM Gastrointestinal Full Panel Assay (Seegene) is a system with 4 panels that detects viruses, bacteria and parasites and is approved for use in Europe (EC marked).",

[55] [56] [57] At least 40 volatile acids can be detected in stool samples from patients with gastroenteritis, regardless of clinical disease, and different markers are observed depending on the specific type of pathogen. 54 In Bangladeshi patients with Vibrio cholerae infection, fewer volatile compounds are observed than in healthy donor samples. 58 In a study of 35 patients with infectious diarrhoea, compared to 6 controls, there were no hydrocarbons and terpenes in patients with Campylobacter infection, and the absence of non-native furan species was indicative of infections with C. difficile. 54 In the exhaled breath analysis of patients infected with H. pylori, 3 volatile compounds (isobutane, 2-butanone, and ethyl acetate) were observed that were not detected in the controls. 54, 59 These compounds can be produced by H. pylori in vivo or be metabolites that the host produces as a result of infection. Elevated levels of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and hydrogen nitrate have also been reported in the exhaled breath of patients with H. pylori gastritis ",

Those based on the detection of antigens are already common practice in clinical microbiology laboratories, as are those based on molecular techniques, although only for some pathogens such as C. difficile and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli. When choosing the technique and trademark to use, we must consider different criteria, which will include: the pathogen or pathogens we want to detect, the type of patients for whom it is intended, the number of requests we think need to be made, the availability of equipment in the department, as well as the cost of the technique. If we are going to conduct a small number of tests, individual techniques such as EIA or ICT would be most appropriate, while if the number of tests is high, it will be more convenient to perform ELISA tests. Molecular techniques that detect different pathogens simultaneously can be very useful in certain groups of patients and will become increasingly important because of their high sensitivity and specificity, as well as their speed, albeit at a higher cost.",
