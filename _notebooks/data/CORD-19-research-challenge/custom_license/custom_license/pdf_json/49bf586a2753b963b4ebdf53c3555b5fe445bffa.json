We describe designed immortalization of primary fetal cells from the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) to facilitate isolation and characterization of pathogens associated with these mammals. Three cell lines with different properties were recovered and successful immortalization was confirmed by continuous cultivation for over 18 months. Surprisingly, the cell lines are fully permissive for a highly attenuated poxvirus, modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA). MVA is a safe and well characterized vaccine vector that cannot replicate in most mammalian cells. High permissivity of Rousettus cell lines could justify testing bats for susceptibility to MVA as a replication competent vector with low zoonotic potential to induce herd immunity in bat colonies against viruses causing rabies or haemorrhagic fevers.",

Species from both groups are implicated as reservoirs for a diverse spectrum of zoonotic pathogens (reviewed in Calisher et al., 2006) . Wide distribution and genetic diversity of some of the viruses including lyssaviruses (Arguin et al., 2002; Messenger et al., 2002; Van der Poel et al., 2005) and coronaviruses (Chu et al., 2006; Li et al., 2005) suggest a long history of endemic presence in bat populations. For Nipah and Hendra viruses bats appear to function as both reservoir and vector (Chua et al., 2002; Halpin et al., 2000; Hayman et al., 2008; Reynes et al., 2005; Yob et al., 2001) . Bats are furthermore investigated as reservoir to filoviruses as animals positive for RNA sequences from or antibodies against filoviruses have been found in regions where outbreak of Marburg or Ebola hemorrhagic fever has been recorded (Leroy et al., 2005; Swanepoel et al., 2007; Towner et al., 2007) . However, live filoviruses have not yet been isolated from wild bats, possibly because bats are not a primary reservoir, or because the window of active shedding of filoviruses is brief and may require activation by physiological stimuli such as endocrine responses to stress (Strong et al., 2008) .",

Fluctuations in body temperature and metabolic rates to conserve energy for self-powered flight may help viruses to establish subclinical persistence. Self-powered flight also allows for wide dissemination of pathogens. Finally, bats comprise a very old order of the mammalia class, branching into the various bat species 89 million years ago in the late Cretaceous period (Bininda-Emonds et al., 2007) . Their innate and adaptive immune system may react to certain pathogens very differently compared to the immune system of most extant mammalia, and some zoonotic agents may have decreased pathogenicity towards bats due to coevolution with the flying mammals as reservoir .",

The uteri were approximately 2 cm in diameter; they were placed into PBS immediately after removal for transport at ambient temperature to the cell culture laboratory. Six hours after sample removal, the fetuses were excised from the uteri. Amniotic fluid, cells from brain, liver, and the vertebrate column were carefully aspirated under sterile conditions with 18G syringes and transferred (separately, not as pool) into culture medium. Body segments without further attempt at obtaining specific tissues were briefly treated with TrypLE (Gibco) prior to tituration into culture medium. Culture medium is DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen) containing 5% gamma-irradiated fetal calf serum (Biochrom AG); only for the initial five passages the medium was also supplemented with antibiotic and antimycotic (Gibco/Invitrogen), long-EGF (SAFC) to 20 ng/ml and long-R3IGF-I (SAFC) to 10 ng/ml. Cells from a total of 14 preparations were seeded into 6-well culture plates and transfected using effectene (Qiagen) within 7-9 days after plating.

Thereafter, the transfection mix was applied to the cell monolayer in a final volume of 1 ml of medium.

Two days thereafter, the cultures were fixed with methanol and incubated with polyclonal vaccinia virus antibodies (Quartett, Germany; at 1:1000 dilution in PBS containing 1% fetal calf serum) for 1 h at 37 \u2022 C. Two wash steps were performed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma Corp., USA) and secondary antibody to the vaccinia-specific antibody is added at 1:1000 dilution in PBS containing 1% fetal calf serum. This secondary antibody is coupled to the peroxidase enzyme that catalyzes a color reaction upon incubation with AEC reagent (3-amino-9ethyl-carbozole; 0.3 mg/ml in 0.1 M acetate buffer pH 5.0 containing 0.015% H 2 O 2 ). Infected foci are identified by light microscopy and plaque forming units are calculated from the maximum dilution of MVA suspension that yields a positive dye reaction.",

Using homologous recombination in E. coli (strain BJ5183BJ5183 recBCsbcBC) (Chartier et al., 1996) , the cassette was integrated into a plasmid containing the complete adenovirus 5 genome. After liberation of the vector sequences from the plasmid backbone by digestion with PacI the vector genome was transfected into HEK293 cells. Plaques were isolated from cell monolayers overlaid with agarose and amplified on HEK 293 cells. Infection with AdGFP was performed in minimal amount of medium (300 l DMEM/F12) without FCS for 3 h. AdGFP was given to cell monolayers either as crude thaw/freeze lysates from infected HEK 293 cells cleared by brief ultracentrifugation, or purified by ultracentrifugation through a CsCl gradient.

Transfection efficiency was satisfactory (see parallel GFP control in Fig. 1A ) and first foci of clonal cells with less pleomorphic appearance than primary cells were visible within 2 weeks of transfection. Primary cells died from senescence with repeated passaging of the cultures. Senescence describes a cellular state with decreased proliferation rates until complete stasis or cell death due to telomere erosion of the chromosomes and accumulation of signal proteins important in cell cycle control. Senescent cells usually are large and pleomorphic with striated cytoplasm of low phase contrast. Fig. 1A shows three of the final cell lines after 40 weeks (low passage) and after 80 weeks (high passage cell lines) of continuous culture. Surprisingly, even after 35 weeks of continuous culture morphologies of the immortalized cells at subconfluency highly resemble morphology of the source culture (cell lines R05T was derived from the head of the fetus from animal #15, R06E from the body of the fetus from animal #12 and R05R from the vertebrate column of the fetus from animal #12). Doubling time of R06E and R05T is approximately 50 h, of R05R approximately 6 days. Because proliferation of the R05R cells is so slow most experiments described here were performed with R06E and R05T. ",

After the third and fourth passage the infected R06E cells were mixed with an equal number of HEK 293 cells.

As expected, no spread of virus and no or minimal cytopathic effect was visible in the Vero cell line that is refractory for MVA. Titration confirmed productive replication in Rousettus cells. Especially for R06E number of produced infectious units was very high, similar to values obtained with the avian CR and CS cell lines and exceeding values obtained with BHK cells (Fig. 3B) .

However, signal intensity was extremely weak (compare nuclear staining of Rousettus lines to signal obtained with CR cell line as positive control in Fig. 5 ).

However, E1A also interferes with other transcriptional co-activators and by doing so induces apoptosis via several pathways (Frisch and Mymryk, 2002; Putzer et al., 2000) .

MVA is a highly promising tool for therapeutic and protective vaccine applications (Sutter and Moss, 1992; Weyer et al., 2007) : it can be made to express recombinant vaccine antigens in cells not permissive for a full infectious cycle and combines highest level of safety even for immunocompromized human patients with induction of a robust and broad immune response in the organism. Among mammalian cells only the BHK-21 line (from Syrian hamster kidney) has been shown to be fully permissive for MVA (Carroll and Moss, 1997; Drexler et al., 1998) . In the R06E line MVA replicates to levels beyond 10 8 pfu/ml (Fig. 3) that rival avian cells, exceeding the published and our parallel values in the range of 10 6 pfu/ml for replication in BHK (Drexler et al., 1998) .

In all of these cell lines strong E1 expression is maintained without selection, in the venerable HEK 293 cell line in many laboratories since 1977, in the avian CR cell lines for more than 260 passages that include several cloning steps and adaptation to proliferation in suspension in chemically defined medium. In the Rousettus cell lines E1A and E1B expression is extremely weak especially in R06E. Transfection with expression plasmids for the GFP reporter gene under control of the same promoters used to drive E1A and E1B expression yields low GFP signal intensity in Rousettus cells but not in the avian reference cells. E1 expression close to the detection limit in the R06E cell line possibly was insufficient for a complete immortalization explaining a long lag phase for 30 weeks, during which a subpopulation of R06E evolved into a different lineage with very short doubling times. Serendipitously weak expression of E1A in all Rousettus cell lines may explain the low level of differentiation into epithelial phenotype that is expected in an E1A-positive cell line (Frisch, 1994) . Sudden proliferation after a long lag phase in R06E (Fig. 1B) is fully compatible with the model that immortalization occurs in consecutive steps (Hahn and Weinberg, 2002; Ye et al., 2008) . If the biochemical pathways for cell cycle progression are not clearly defined the cell population will eventually shunt into alternative routes. Even for stem cell lines with potential for unlimited proliferation culture conditions exert selective pressure such as overexpression of NANOG to relieve dependence on feeder layers (Darr et al., 2006) . In R05T E1 expression is stronger and this cell line displayed only a short lag phase (probably adaptation of the nascent cell line to culture conditions ex vivo) after which proliferation rates remain stable also at high passages. R06E is an impressive example for the kinetic with which E1 expression is lost if it is not required by a cell line.",

            "text": "But even more interesting and unexpected is the effect of loss of E1 expression (from human adenovirus) on the kinetic of MVA replication (avian-attenuated poxvirus) in the permissive Rousettus cell line. Parallel experiments with R05T matched in passage number to R06E serve as reference highlighting the role of E1 for our observation. E1A has been implicated in the response of adenovirus against the anti-viral mechanism within the host cell, including inhibition of interferon cascades (Anderson and Fennie, 1987; Leonard and Sen, 1997) . The importance of the interferon response feeding into recognition of viral RNA as a pathogenassociated pattern has recently been demonstrated in persistent infection of Ebola virus (Strong et al., 2008) . It is possible that the anti-antiviral effects of E1A in the Rousettus cell lines lower the defenses of the producer cell for MVA leading to faster replication. We should be careful in extrapolating from replication of MVA in Rousettus cell lines to other systems. However, in the light of the results by Strong et al. (2008) we speculate that an E1Apositive R05T cell line would be preferred over the late-passage R06E for pathogen isolation as the R05T cell line may be less prone to cryptic infection. To examine field samples for pathogens it may also be helpful to add low levels of mitogens such as phorbol esters to obtain higher levels of virus or better detectable CPE.",

Low levels of gene expression may affect virus replication or expression of genes involved in inflammation and innate immunity. The Rousettus cell lines appear not to be notably resistant to viruses: they are partially permissive for a human adenovirus vector and fully permissive for MVA, a highly attenuated virus that does not replicate in most mammalian cells. Permissivity for such a selective virus suggests that the Rousettus cell lines may allow isolation of pathogens where suitable host cells have previously not been available. Also, if MVA can be shown to replicate and spread in bats without causing significant disease this virus has the potential to provide a vaccine vector that should remain confined to the treated colonies and yet induces herd immunity.",
