But businesses are also starting to suffer as productivity slips globally and the workforce itself is squeezed. The UK Government's March budget did announce some measures, especially for small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), that will make this period slightly less painful for organisations. However, as is apparent from the tanking stock market (the FTSE 100 has hit levels not seen since June 2012) the economy and pretty much all businesses in the country (unless you produce hand sanitiser) are going to suffer. There is no time like now for the UK to embrace its mantra of 'keep calm and carry on' because that is what we must do if we're going to keep business flowing.",

It will first examine the insider threat, and why this has become so much more insidious because of Covid-19. It will then look into the essential soft skills required to tackle this threat, before examining how organisations can effectively implement an apprenticeship strategy that generates professionals with both hard and soft skills, including advice from the CISO of globally respected law firm Pinsent Masons, who will provide insight into how he is making his strategy work. It will conclude that many of these issues could be solved if the industry didn't rely so heavily on recruiting graduates and rather looked towards hiring apprentices.",

The problem is that people lack cyber knowledge and so commit careless actions -for example, forwarding sensitive information to the wrong recipient over email or plugging rogue USBs into their device (yes, that still happens). Cyber criminals capitalise on this ignorance by utilising social engineering tactics ranging from the painfully simple, like fake emails from Amazon, to the very sophisticated, such as CEO fraud. A contact from the industry that works at one of the world's largest consultancies recently relayed a case of CEO fraud where a cyber criminal hacked into a CEO's email server to learn the syntax he used. The hacker then sent a carefully crafted redemption request to the CEO's fund manager and was able to steal \u00a35m.",

When you download the file, a map of how the disease is spreading pops up, but a malicious binary file (using software known as AZORult) has been installed in the background. AZORult is known to steal victims' browsing history, cookies, ID, passwords and crypto-currencies. 4 The situation is so dire that even the WHO has provided a six-step guide as to what to look out for, which includes verifying email addresses, heightened awareness around providing personal identifiable information (PII), not feeling pressured to supply and respond in these times of urgency and reporting anything that doesn't feel right. 5 Cyber security teams must make sure that strict measures and policies are in place to ensure the highest level of security when staff are working from home. And if this isn't a common practice already, now is the time to implement it -and quickly. Top strategies include requiring multi-factor authentication to log into company portals, and requiring all personal devices to be equipped with employer-provided security software and the latest software updates prior to permitting any access to remote systems. But, of equal importance is ensuring that staff are equipped with the essential cyber skills needed to avoid scams -and that they follow company policy because they understand why strict measures are in place.

UK cyber security is now worth \u00a38.3bn and is staffed by 43,000 full-time employees. 6 However, despite this, as we're all aware, there are not enough people to fortify organisations against cybercrime, with the average data breach costing businesses \u00a33m. 7 The International Information System Security Certification Consortium, or (ISC)\u00b2 -a non-profit specialising in training and certifications for cyber security professionals -found the global skills gap grew by 33% in 2019. Some 65% of firms have a shortage of cyber staff and the UK needs to increase its workforce by 291,000 people to plug the gap. 8 Many organisations will assume that, because the job is technical, cyber security professionals must have a university degree to qualify. However, this simply isn't the case and is part of the reason why we are struggling to fill the cyber security skills gap -there aren't enough cyber security graduates to defend against the UK's cyberthreat. The solution lies with an incredibly underestimated group of people. Apprentices become fantastic cyber security professionals, who have the technical skills that graduates have, as well as arguably better soft skills because their learning process requires them to get real-world experience working with people.",
