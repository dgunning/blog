            "text": "groups are likely to carry a heavier burden of what will be the devastating downstream economic and social consequences of this pandemic. 2 A sexual and reproductive health and justice framework-one that centres human rights, acknowledges intersecting injustices, recognises power structures, and unites across identities-is essential for monitoring and addressing the inequitable gender, health, and social effects of COVID19. The complex interplay between biological and behav ioural risk factors needs to be recognised during the COVID19 pandemic. It is not yet known whether the higher COVID19 case fatality rates reported in men compared with women in China, South Korea, and Italy 3 to date are attributed to sexspecific biological susceptibility, variations in preexisting comorbidities, behavioural risk factors, or some combination of these factors. 4, 5 In terms of behavioural risk factors, women's risk of contracting COVID19 may be higher than men's risk as women are frontline providers, comprising 70% of the global health and social care workforce, and they do three times as much unpaid care work at home as men. 2, 6 Moreover, pregnant women could be at risk of pregnancyrelated complications during the COVID19 pandemic. 7 Severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome were associated with increased risk of pregnancyrelated morbidity and mortality, 7 but data on COVID19 are scarce. 8 In China, among nine women in their third trimester with COVID19, clinical outcomes were similar to non pregnant adults. 4 Yet another study of 33 neonates born to mothers with COVID19 identified intrauterine vertical transmission of COVID19 in three neonates. 9 However, studies to date have been based on third trimester cases and viral infections during pregnancy are typically most severe during the first 20 weeks of gestation. 10 Disruption of services and diversion of resources away from essential sexual and reproductive health care because of prioritising the COVID19 response are expected to increase risks of maternal and child morbidity and mortality. 6, 7 Globally, there are anticipated shortages of contraception. 11 Sexual and reproductive health providers and clinics, which are the primary care providers and safety net for women of reproductive aged, youth, those uninsured for health care, and people on low incomes in many countries including in the USA, may also be deemed nonessential and diverted to respond to COVID19. 6 Past humanitarian crises have shown that reduced access to family planning, abortion, antenatal, HIV, genderbased violence, and mental health care services results in increased rates and sequelae from unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), pregnancy complications, miscarriage, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, suicide, intimate partner violence, and maternal and infant mortality. 1, 12 Additionally, systemic racism, dis crimi nation, and stigma are likely to further compound logistical barriers to accessing sexual and reproductive health care for women and marginalised groups.",

The US administration's Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance (PLGHA) policy is of grave concern. The PLGHA expanded the Global Gag Rule (the Mexico City policy), which blocks US global health assistance to foreign nongovernmental organisations that provide, counsel, refer, or advocate for abortion services. Three crucial impacts of the PLGHA include decreased stakeholder coordination and chilling of sexual and reproductive health and rights discussions; reduced access to family planning, with increases in unintended pregnancy and induced abortion; and negative outcomes beyond sexual and reproductive health, including weakened health systems functioning. 13 Migration policies of deterrence, including closures at US and European borders, force women to live in informal settlements or conditions of poverty for long periods of time, often without basic sanitation and hygiene or access to health care during antenatal and postnatal periods.",

Telemedicine can be used to provide access to services for medication abortion, contraception, and expedited partner therapy for STI prevention, as well as traumainformed care for managing genderbased violence, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and suicide. 16, 17 Sexdisaggregated mortality and morbidity surveillance data should be a priority in COVID19 research. 3, 5 Plans must prioritise protections for participants but account for gender perspectives, lived experiences, and outcomes in research design, intervention, evaluation, interpre tation, and dissemination. Immediate research priorities focused on identifying the pathophysiology of the disease and the development of vaccines and therapeutics should give explicit attention to sex differences in viral transmission and disease progression, biological, social, and environmental risks by gender, and safety of vaccines and drugs for pregnant and lactating women. 18 All these efforts must be community driven. Recognition of inequitable power structures, distri bution of resources, and a collaborative approach dictates the way forward. Advocates must continue to fight the exploitation of the COVID19 crisis to further an agenda that restricts access to essential sexual and reproductive health services, particularly abortion, and targets immigrants and adolescents.",
