Given that patients outside the 40 isolation ward may not be subject to movement restrictions and share common facilities, social mingling 41 represents a potential route for nosocomial spread, especially as COVID-19 cases may present with mild 42 symptoms and remain relatively well. [1] While social distancing has been identified as crucial for containment 43 in the community, [2] social distancing within hospitals is equally vital in reducing nosocomial spread, 44 especially in hospitals where the majority of patients are nursed in multi-bedded cohort rooms, rather than in 45 single-occupancy rooms. 46",

However, given rising numbers of locally-transmitted cases, from 4 February, our institution 51 placed individuals admitting with respiratory symptoms but without suspicious contact or travel history in 52 respiratory surveillance wards (RSWs) where COVID-19 was first excluded and healthcare workers (HCWs) 53 used full personal protective equipment (PPE) including N95 masks, disposable gowns, gloves and 54 faceshields. Despite this resource-intensive containment effort, it was recognised that some cases of COVID-55 19 with mild symptoms might be initially admitted to the general ward. Our institution therefore emphasised 56 hospital-wide social distancing measures. For patients admitting to the RSW, as the risk of a potentially 57 unsuspected case of COVID-19 was higher, patients were advised to avoid mingling and to wear surgical 58 spaced at least ~2 metres apart, and partitions were placed between patient beds (Figure 1 ). In the general 61 ward, shared communal facilities (eg. day rooms) were closed during the duration of the ongoing COVID-19 62 outbreak, and patients were limited to one visitor at any time. HCWs in the general ward wore surgical masks. 63",
