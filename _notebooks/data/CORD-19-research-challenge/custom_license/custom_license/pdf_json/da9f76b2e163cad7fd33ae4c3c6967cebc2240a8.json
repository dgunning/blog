Technical developments over a broad range of engineering disciplines have radically changed the nature of the physical world in which we live. Our knowledge base has expanded concurrently, enabling us to provide materially based and more convincing answers to questions which baffled our antecedents of 200 years ago. This requires that we review and reconsider the ethical guidelines for behaviour which have been largely founded on philosophies and concepts whose origins may be traced back to between 1000 and 3500 years ago. An example of the implications of these changes may be seen in the area of vaccines and vaccination which evinces the pressing need to review traditional ethical positions to take the maximum advantage of the potential for animal and human benefit inherent in this prophylactic approach to healthcare.",

Mill); as in UN or CfE declarations on human rights) is challenged. While the principle of autonomy may be asailed from a number of different facets such as the competence of an individual to provide informed consent, the rights of a fetus if the pregnant mother decides to be immunized or the implicit implications of the social contract entered into when an individual chases to dwell in a particular society, I will examine in University of Surrey, School of Biological Sciences, Guildford, Surrey GU2 5XH, UK more detail a further issue involving the expression of social responsibility.",

Not only that, but such unvaccinated individuals pose a threat to the vaccinees as they serve as a reservoir in which the disease can be maintained and propagated. Were the society to collectively determine that all its citizens should receive the vaccine then the principle of patient autonomy is infringed. An intermediate position might be to levy a special cash buy-out dispensation to those who refuse vaccination as a contribution to the costs incurred by those who have accepted the risks of vaccine-induced damage. Whatever the outcome in any particular society it is clear that vaccination poses a challenge to accepted ethical positions, the resolution of which will be dependent of the degree of social coherence and farsightedness.",

The function of the company was to accumulate profits for its shareholders and top managers (incentives) and society did not interfere with the way the product was made, nor with the product spectrum on offer. This ethic too, is in need of review. Vaccines are a clear benefit to society as a whole. However, there is a risk of vaccine-induced long-term and severely debilitating damage [well recognized for Polio vaccines and less well established for any other vaccine cf. Swine Fever (inactivated influenza) Vaccines and Guillain-Barre syndrome] which is especially poignant when incurred after the vaccination of a 3-month-old healthy infant. Under present conditions the manufacturing company may be sued for damages both actual and punitive (if wilful negligence is proven). But is this the appropriate ethic? May not the society, in accepting the benefit of widespread vaccination, compensate those who suffer damage at a level communsurate with the damage?

Also, as the cost of obtaining a product license is estimated to be some $200-600 million, the implications for the cost of a dose of vaccine is more driven by the cost of the regulatory procedure than the production cost (which rarely exceeds the cost of the bottle plus label). The ethical issue here is whether the regulatory hurdle which has to be overcome is really operating in society's best interests. Nothing we eat or do is without the risk of incurring damage. Vaccines are not different in that respect. Yet the cost of obtaining a license to manufacture and distribute implies that the cost of the vaccine has to be many dollars merely to recoup the costs involved. Does this mean that the rich should pay a high price for a vaccine and thus subsidize the provision of cheap vaccines to the poor? Or is it the job of the elected representatives of the people to act as purchaser on behalf of the poor and provide the vaccine manufacturer compensation through the tax system or other fiscal dispensation?",

Research on vaccines which would prevent the common cold (caused by a combination of Rhinoviruses, Coronaviruses and Admoviruses) is also conspicuous by its absense. But prophylaxis as an approach to healthcare is also underfunded by society at large. Therapeutic research receives over 10 times the funding of prophylaxis; and this is particularly difficult to understand when there are many inexpensive ways of achieving prophylaxis, of which vaccination, which affects the immune system, is but one. Other methods of prevention focus on the protection of the immune system to decrease the probability that it will be overwhelmed by an endogenous or exogenous pathogen; such procedures may be termed 'Fence Vaccines\".",

In that way something of a bargain may be established such that overt exploitation has been subverted into mutual gain. In all such situations it would not be an acceptable ethic to effect trials with placebo controls which did not provide the best possible protection.

            "text": "On a more esoteric plane, it is possible to argue that, through the use of vaccines, mankind has developed a capability which may eventually rid the world of those infectious microoganisms which have been the bane of our struggle to survive. This depletion of the deitic armamentarium may be construed as seeking to deny the deity of one of its controlling effector systems; namely, the threat of divine retribution through the causation of plagues6. Alternatively, it may be held with equal rectitude, that the deity ordained us to discover and use vaccines as part of its (undisclosed) master plan. Consonant with this latter controversy, there are those who assert that it is unnatural to disturb the ways of nature and as vaccines are a creation of mankind, they are not natural and are therefore to be condemned. As this contention rests on the definition of what is natural it is possible to reconstrue this issue totally were we to assert that whatever exists is natural: merely by virtue of its existence. It would follow that there does not exist anything which is artificial (in the sense of unnatural) which implies that all the products of the arts (techniques, crafts, skills) of humans (and animals) are natural and are incorrectly designated as artificial unless the meaning of that term were changed to its more appropriate designation, as works which are the product of humankind's arts (hence arti-ficial; made by art). Now that it is practicable to identify a defective gene in an adult, child or even embryo, techniques are in development to repair, exchange or inactivate that gene specifically. These methods imply the existence of 'genetic vaccines'. However, these self-same methods may be used not just to correct defects but to enhance characteristics we may desire to accentuate'. As the word 'disease' is defined as a state of being in which one is not-at-ease, it is not difficult to use the word to describe a situation where a person is not at ease with their height, intelligence, running or ageing, speed etc. This raises the ethical question of the use of genetic vaccines to prevent the disease resulting from such deeply held feelings. There is little doubt that the remediation and/or prevention of situations which cause physical pain is encouraged and applauded by society. The same cannot be asserted where the pain Ethical aspects of vaccines and vaccination: R. E. Spier may be psychological. Nevertheless, this latter pain is just as actionable as the physical pain (indeed it is physical, but of the activities of the brain as opposed to muscle). Indeed, not only would we relieve suffering but we might also achieve a human being who is more functionally capable of making a more extensive contribution to society; a feature which is not given to all pain-killing remedies. That such measures might be construed as interfering with some transcendental plan cannot be denied, but the ethic of beneficence might be applied to progress the use of these genetic vaccines in all their manifestations. Were we to have an effective orally deliverable contraceptive vaccine' (pregnancy results from the infection of the female by a male spermatozoan) then ethical considerations will be required to determine the way in which such a powerful tool for population control might be used. The contamination of drinking water supplies with a contraceptive vaccine would act counter to the autonomy principle of ethics and could be held to be an affront to the dignity of humanity in denying individuals control over their own fertility. Notwithstanding this clear ruling, it is possible to conceive of conditions in which a decrease in population levels is an urgent necessity and the use of an orally delivered contraceptive vaccine might be the only way of achieving that end without recourse to widespread sterilization. As with any other tool, we have to adopt an ethic which permits its appropriate use; what we need to do ahead of time is to discuss and debate what those circumstances might be.",

The insinuation of industrialists into the peer review process for grant applications generated by academics has been one area where the bicameral functionality of the seconded industrialist leads to the funding of conservative research projects which do not compete with the industrialist's undisclosed mission. In this, society is not well served by the monies it sets aside for both academic and publicly funded research.",

            "text": "Society is not amorphous. It has structure through its institutions. The institutions which affect the way the regulatory process works may be identified as being (1) the ethical bodies; (2) the media; (3) legislatures; and (4) the educational system (Figure 2 ). The ethical bodies include recognized religions whose leaders provide ethical guidance to the members which impinges on the production and use of vaccines, while bearing in mind current social exigencies. There are secular sources of ethical guidelines which are not as well organized and overt. Such individuals might recognize that ethics are not guidelines which are provided by the pronouncemnts of a deity but are rather the set points in the control system which modulates human social behaviour with the objective of promoting both the survival of the individual, society and other biotic entities as wealth and the occasion permits'\". The media are informed by the religous ethicists as well as picking up on the raw nerve endings of the fears and sensitivities of their fellow socialites. They do not hesitate to evoke the image of the entity created by Victor Frankenstein at the prospects of the slightest opportunity of affecting a deliberate change to the genetics of the human species. Our tradition encourages us to regard monsters as the avenging agents of personal wrongdoing; so such buttons do not require much pressing to evoke negative reactions to Vaccine 1998 Volume 16 Number 19 1793 Ethical aspects of vaccines and vaccination: R. E. Spier the prospects of experiments gone awry. The third effector on the way the regulatory agencies behave is the legislature. It is by law that pharmaceutical products have to be safe, efficacious and be made by a demonstrably consistent process. But how safe is safe? and what is efficacious? and what are the limits by which we define consistency? The answers to each of these questions pose ethical problems. It is recognized that a balance has to be struck between the urgency of the need (if we don't have the agent, people will die) and the side-effects of the product. Education is a key feature when we consider how humans behave socially. Some attribute the education of children to parents only, and see the education institutions as providing knowledge and capability, but not ethics. Others would have us believe that we receive effective training in ethics thoughout our lives from all kinds of sources of which educational institutions are prominent. It is a matter of choice as to whether an individual believes that 'you can't teach an old dog new tricks'. It is a matter of record that modern adults have to relearn their new car's control systems and idiosyncrasies each time they change their car. Learning to programme a video, access and use the internet, come to terms with computers, air travel and internationally derived food menues has come to many people late in life, yet they have made changes to their behaviours in the light of these new developments. We are indeed open to lifelong education for which our modern universities are reorganizing.",

While they have accepted for many years the need for sympathetic public relations (with the media) and for lobbying activities (to affect the laws which receive legislative approval), they have not until now perceived that they have also to meet the challenge of ethics providers. This can be effected at two levels; the one, via the bodies which focus on the generation of ethical guidelines; the other, the educational system from the earliest grades to those who return to education in their third age or later. Industrialists will have to recognize that ethics matters. They will have to support institutions which engage in devising an ethics which is wholly compatible with living in a modern world with ever changing technologies and concepts about the nature of life and the way the world works. And they must engage in the promotion of ethics in a society which is hungry for a new ethical synthesis (Figure 3) . All this has to be done at arm's length. There is no substitute for the realization that we all are members of the community and responsible in some measure for our mutual well-being: sectors cannot profit at the expense of other segments. This concurrence of aims needs a reaffirmation; it is hoped that industry will see its future success through the inclusion of this mission in its project portfolio.",
