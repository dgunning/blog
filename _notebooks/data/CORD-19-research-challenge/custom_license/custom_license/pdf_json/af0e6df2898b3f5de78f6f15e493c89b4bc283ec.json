Furthermore, on Jan 30, the WHO issued a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) alarm and appealed all specialists over the world working together to control the rapid spread of COVID-19. As of Mar 8, there had been 80,859 confirmed patients of COVID-19 in China, including 3,100 deaths.",

Most of them had been directly exposed to the Wuhan seafood wholesale market, which sells freshly slaughtered game animals, that were the original infection source [4] . The present data strongly suggest that game animals or mammals were probably intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 that originated from the Chinese horseshoe bat [5, 6] . In addition, the virus has preferential tropism to human airway epithelial cells through the same cellular receptor as that for SARS, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2), which is a central body receptor for the surface glycoprotein S of the virus [7] . The way to ascertain disease depends on positive real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction(rRT-PCR) results for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, and the associated mortality rates are 2-3% [3, 8] . Currently, there are no definite antiviral therapies or vaccines for J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 COVID-19, although some drugs are under investigation.",

An increasing number of outbreaks of familial transmission stressed the possibility of person-to-person transmission [10] [11] [12] . The measures in which public health officials quarantine confirmed cases and isolate intimate patients are significant progress in responding to COVID-19 control. Another question for consideration is a group of asymptomatically infected individuals, which may propagate the virus and impede infection control [5, 13] . Bai et al. [14] presented clinical data showing a familial cluster of 5 patients with COVID-19 and 1 asymptomatic family member, which presumed the possibility of infection from asymptomatic carriers.",

Subsequently, forty-four other intimate contacts were admitted to our hospital for general physical examination on Feb 5.

All cases were enrolled in hospital and treated in isolation. A detailed data collection for the five patients was executed, and all patients underwent chest CT imaging. All the laboratory procedures for clinical samples have been previously reported [15] . Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs and stool and urine samples were obtained and maintained viral transport medium. Plasma was separated from EDTA bottles, and serum was separated from clotted blood bottles. Specimens were placed between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C and sent to the CDC.

At the onset, the symptoms are usually fever, cough, shortness of breath and pharyngalgia or diarrhoea [17] . The emblematic radiologic characteristic is ground-glass opacities in the lungs. Laboratory data present as lymphocytopenia, hypoxemia, thrombocytopenia, and even liver and kidney dysfunction in severe pneumonia patients [4] .

It was certain that Case 2 through 5 had no abnormal symptoms before the outbreak of Case 1. Notably, COVID-19 is highly J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f infectious, and may be transmitted by asymptomatic carriers during the incubation period. The timeline events suggest that Case 4 was the most likely initial infection source, as the time of the onset of symptoms and negative rRT-PCR results was relatively earlier than Case 3 and Case 5 (Figure 2 ). Case 2 was afebrile without any clinical signs, and his chest CT images showed no abnormalities on Feb 5 and Feb 15 (Figure 1 ), which also proved the existence of asymptomatic carriers. Our findings provide evidence that asymptomatic carriers can be a latent source of COVID-19 infection. As the spread of COVID-19 is aggravating worldwide, it is pressing to provide more meritorious information for an improved understanding of the transmission and precaution of COVID-19. Further studies on the mechanism in which asymptomatic carriers can acquire and transmit COVID-19 are warranted.",

Between Jan 23 and Jan 25, she attended the family reunion dinner with her family members(Case 2/3/4/5). On Jan 30, they celebrated the Spring Festival together. Because of the limits on access, Case 1 could not leave her hometown in the countryside, where there had been no previous reports of COVID-19. Furthermore, she had not been in contact with any person returning from Wuhan(except Case 3/4/5). In particular, Case 1 did not present any symptoms until Feb 1. She became ill with fever, and non-productive cough, and she took drugs at that time. By the evening, Case 1 started feeling better and continued to enjoy the Spring Festival. However, two days later, a fever of 38.6\u00b0C recurred, along with dizziness, non-productive cough, and shortness of breath. She was presented to the hospital by her son on Feb 4(Figure 2). The laboratory examination revealed an increasing level of white blood cell count (12.4\u00d710 9 /L), neutrophil count(7.82\u00d710 9 /L), C-reactive protein level (189.2 mg/L) and a low lymphocyte count(0.84\u00d710 9 /L) and platelet count(88\u00d710 9 /L) (Table 1). CT images showed massive shadows of high density in the lungs(Figure 1). Case 1 developed severe pneumonia and was enrolled in the ICU as dyspnoea increased, with hypoxemia on day 2 of hospitalization. As ofFeb 15, her clinical condition had improved, and her oxygen saturation values recovered to 94% on supplemental oxygen. A nasopharyngeal and a oropharyngeal J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f swab obtained on admission day 10 remained positive for SARS-CoV-2",

On Feb 5, she also presented to the hospital, and a nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2(Ct values, 26). Her chest CT images were standard(Figure 1). From Jan 22 to Feb 4, Case 4 did not present any symptoms until 7 PM on Feb 5. She started having slight pharyngalgia and diarrhoea (3-5 times per day) without increasing body temperature or cough. Laboratory examination indicated a rising C-reactive protein (43.5 mg/L), and her platelet count decreased(72\u00d710 9 /L). Case 4 was started on oxygen support at 2 L per minute and was treated with oseltamivir (75 mg every 12 hours), dioctahedral smectite powder (3 g every 8 hours) and cefixime (100 mg every 12 hours). Two days later, she felt better. Her rRT-PCR results were negative on Feb 15(Table 2). Case 3 and Case 5 are previously healthy men without a history of hypertension or type 2 diabetes. On days 3 through 5 of hospitalization, they developed fever and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f cough symptoms.
