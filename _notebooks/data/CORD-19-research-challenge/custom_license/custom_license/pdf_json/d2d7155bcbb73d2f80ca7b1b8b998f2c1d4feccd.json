A single membrane glycoprotein on influenza C virus called HEF (haemagglutinin, esterase, fusion) has three activities} It binds the virus to cellular receptors containing 9-O-acetylsialic acid, it destroys receptors on infected cells with a 9-O-acetylsialic acid esterase, (Scheme 1) and it mediates fusion of the viral and cell membranes during viral entry. The HE glycoprotein on coronaviruses, which cause 25-30% of common colds in humans, 3 has significant sequence identity with HEF, 4 and contains a closely related 9-O-acetylsialic acid esterase. 5 Because these viral 9-O-acetyl esterases appear to define a new class of serine esterase, ~ they may be good targets for synthetic viral inhibitors.",

The best results were achieved, when the reaction was performed at 65 \u00b0C in DMF for 4 h. Under these conditions, the azide 3 was isolated in 46% yield after silica gel chromatography. Next, the azido functionality in 3 was reduced to an amino group with tin(II)chloride in methanol as the reducing agent. ]5 Attempts to perform the reduction through catalytic hydrogenation with a variety of catalysts (Pd/C, Lindlar, Pt) in different solvents (MeOH, water) were not successful, since in all cases partial or quantitative reduction of the ~-ketoacid functionality in 3 occurred along with the desired reduction of the azido group. Using the SnCI2/MeOHsystem, however, no side products were formed and the desired amine 4 was obtained in 90% yield after silica gel chromatography followed by gel filtration.
