DNA fragments encoding variable regions of heavy and light chains were amplified by RT-PCR and library of scFv was constructed in phage vector. Two scFv clones that were selected showed specific reactivity with conformational epitope VP7. The N-terminal 22 amino acid residues of 20E9 light chain were identical to that deduced from scFv DNA sequence. An in-frame TAG stop codon was found in the coding sequence and its potential role in regulating the expression and stability of scFv in phage is discussed.",

However, the reactivity was low with untreated BTV1 virus (OD 450 in the range of 0.18-0.13) but this was significantly enhanced when the virus was treated with 1% SDS (OD 450 increased to 0.88). There was no significant reactivity with any of the unrelated proteins. The specificity of the scFv was confirmed by competition ELISA. The scFv antibody binding was significantly inhibited (59%) by MAb 20E9 and there was no inhibition in the absence of MAb 20E9.",

It is also interesting to note that the reactivity of phage antibody was much stronger with SDS-treated BTV1 virus than the untreated virus. This is most likely due to ''unmasking'' of the 20E9 epitope by SDS treatment. Although it is known that the MAb 20E9 can access epitope in native virus (Eaton et al., 1991) , exposure of the binding site is limited because VP7 is located beneath the outer capsid.",

Comparison of deduced scFv amino acid sequences with the corresponding N- Fig. 1 . The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the variable regions of heavy (A) and light chains (B) of scFv (from recombinant phage clone 4). For the light chain, primer-coded amino acid residues at the N-terminus were boxed, and the amino acid sequence determined by direct protein sequencing is given in boldface. The two residues given below the primer-coded sequence represent the primer-introduced difference between the original MAb 20E9 protein sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence of the cloned scFv. Residues corresponding to the complementarity-determining (CDR) regions are shaded and the in-frame TAG stop codon in the V H coding region is underlined. The 20E9 antibody gene fragments were assembled from about 10 6 hybridoma cells following manufacturer's instructions (Pharmacia, Uppsala). terminal amino acids of 20E9 light chain confirmed its similarity with native MAb. The fact that the functional scFv was expressed indicated that host cell TG1 (which carries a suppresser gene and supports the growth of vectors with amber mutations) was able to read through stop codon found in the VH coding sequence (Maniatis et al., 1982) . In-frame stop codons usually result in disruption of gene expression in other systems. However, in phage display system, detection limit is lower and low level of read-through activity can be detected. Suppression of TAG stop codon has been utilised in the design of many phage vectors, including pCANTAB5 since high levels of antibody is known to be toxic to E. coli (Parmley and Smith, 1988; Wilson and Finlay, 1998) . Therefore, it may be an advantage to have clones with low levels of scFv on coat protein since such clones probably have growth advantage and could be easily selected. Recently, functional phage clones with in-frame stop codons or out-of-frame gene fusion have been reported (Jacobsson and Frykberg, 1995; Carcamo et al., 1998) . This report describes that the in-frame stop codons are also tolerated in phage antibody expression.",
