According to the information provided by the China Center for Disease Control and in more recent publications, the majority of cases reported came from the Hubei province and in 80% the disease was mild. The proportion of deaths among confirmed cases has fluctuated between 2 and 3%, being higher in Hubei than in the rest of the country that reported a 0.4%. Most cases detected in China are older than 30 years, and among severe and deceased cases there is a high proportion of patients with comorbidities and advanced age ( 2 ,3 ) . To date the hemodialysis cases reported are from a Hubei Hemodialysis center , in which 37 out of 230 dialysis patients, tested positive for COVID-19 in addition 4 of the 33 health personnel were also positive. Six patients with COVID -19 die ( 16.8% ) mainly from cardiovascular causes , with less probability of developing pneumonia than the general population (4) .",
