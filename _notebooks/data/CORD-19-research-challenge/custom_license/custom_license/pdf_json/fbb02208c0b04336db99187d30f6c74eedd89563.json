            "text": "Humanity is about to be marooned in this beautiful world, courtesy to SARS-COV-2. China has witnessed the initiation. Developed countries are experiencing the devastating propagation and termination is yet to be seen. Pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients, having COVID-19 infection, are at higher risk of adverse outcomes and increased mortality. This infection itself can be associated with many cardiovascular complications 1,2 . Drugs used for treatment of COVID-19 infection have many interactions with cardiovascular drugs and can also cause significant adverse cardiovascular effects. 3 Once this infection becomes more prevalent, all patients presenting with symptoms of severe emergent CVD should be managed as suspected cases of COVID-19. 4 Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in COVID-19 infection is primarily attributed to demand supply mismatch. But plaque destabilization may also contribute. Profound inflammatory response and altered hemodynamics associated with severe disease may confer risk for atherosclerotic plaque rupture in susceptible patients. 5 Additionally, it is important to note the potential overlapping symptomatology between ACS and COVID-19. While the predominant presenting symptoms of COVID-19 are respiratory, reports suggest that a patient can present with chest pain and electrocardiographic changes suggestive of ACS with normal coronaries. 6 Considering the present pandemic, for a patient who presents with ACS and in whom the infection has not been ruled out, isolation in a separate room is preferred with hemodynamic monitoring till COVID-19 is excluded. Transfer to different areas of hospital for various tests and investigations should be minimized. Appropriate guideline based personal protection equipment (PPE) is of utmost importance for the protection of medical personnel, as it will not only avoid them getting infected but also prevent nosocomial infection and transmission. Echocardiography should be done only if it contributes to decision making and TEE should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. Personal equipments like stethoscope, BP machine, cellphones have to be decontaminated after each examination.",

So, a conservative approach can be recommended for all ACS patients who are stable. Fibrinolysis may be considered as a reasonable option for stable STEMI patients presenting within stipulated time frame, without contra-indications as per standard protocols. Invasive interventions may be limited to STEMI and NSTEMI with hemodynamic instability. Intervention should be done in a CCL (cardiac catheterization laboratory) if proper PPE is available in an institute with proper infection control unit. The CCL or operating room should preferably have negative pressure ventilation, with strict vigil on postprocedural disinfection. If negative pressure ventilation is not available, air conditioning (laminar flow and ventilation) should be stopped. Minimal equipment in the CCL should be used for procedures.",

            "text": "Issues which require special attention for ACS management during COVID-19 pandemic Hence collaboration with ID Department on regular basis is important. Regular assessment of risk benefit ratio for intervention and ongoing medical treatment is mandatory. 5. In every city, at least a few CCUs (coronary care units) and CCLs should be developed in hospitals caring for COVID-19 positive cases, where patients from other hospitals may be transferred. 6. Delayed presenters of STEMI will significantly increase due to lack of proper transport, lack of routine medical services, reluctance to attend hospital in present conditions and fear of getting infection from healthcare systems. Even in a hospital equipped with CCL, stipulated 'door-to-balloon time' for primary PCI may not be maintained due to delay in ruling out the COVID-19 diagnosis. So thrombolysis is preferred even in hospitals with CCL facilities. 7. Coagulation parameters are deranged during severe COVID infection, which need to kept in mind before giving thrombolysis or antiplatelets. 5 Close monitoring of bleeding parameters should be done in such situations. 8. Anti-viral drugs: Ribavirin has no direct toxicity over CV system. Lopinavir/ritonavir may result in QT and PR interval prolongation, mainly in those having baseline abnormality (long QT) or those who are at risk for conduction abnormalities including those taking other QT prolonging drugs. 9 9. Anticoagulant dosing: Ribavirin has variable effects on warfarin dosing. 10 Lopinavir/ritonavir may need dose reductions or avoidance of CYP3A4 mediated drugs such as rivaroxaban and apixaban. 11 10. Lopinavir/ritonavir, through CYP3A4 inhibition, causes increased serum concentrations of ticagrelor. 12 Hence, concomitant use of ticagrelor should be discouraged due to excess bleeding risk as has been done in USA and Canada. 3 Conversely, clopidogrel may not provide sufficient platelet inhibition during concomitant administration of lopinavir/ritonavir but this was not the case with prasugrel. 13, 14 In case prasugrel cannot be used, testing guided approach with platelet function assays is strongly recommended. 11. Co-administration of lopinavir/ritonavir with statins can result in myopathy due to elevated statin levels. Lovastatin and simvastatin are contraindicated for coadministration with lopinavir/ritonavir for the risk of rhabdomyolysis. Atorvastatin or rosuvastatin, should be administered at the lowest possible dose. 3 12. Being a QT prolonger, cautious use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 15 is needed in ACS patients. Same is true for azithromycin and its combination with HCQ. Careful use with more frequent assessment of QT interval is needed for anti-arrhythmic drugs known to cause QT prolongation, especially amiodarone.",

Myocardial injury and acute myocarditis due to COVID19 infection can mimic ACS. Raised troponin results are very common specially with high sensitivity cardiac troponin assays. So routinely ordered increased troponin values may not be helpful in diagnosis of ACS during COVID 19 infection. 8 3. Rapid antibody detection test can reduce the time delay, and may be helpful for quick triage of COVID-19 positivity in ACS. 4. Patients may be diagnosed as having this infection during the course of hospital stay.",
