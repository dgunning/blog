            "text": "Authors: Sara Cherri (1), Silvia Noventa (1) we cannot certainly conclude that cancer itself is to be considered a negative prognostic factor of complication and / or exitus in case of covid19 infection. We know that the cytokine cascade is probably responsible for acute respiratory complications in patients who develop a severe covid19 infection. On this assumption are based the ongoing trials with immunosuppressive drugs, selective cytokine inhibitors and other drugs with a molecular target such as Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors [4] . On the other hand, we know the complexity of the tumor immunological profile, defined as immunoediting. Cancer immunoediting is the process by which the immune system can both limit and promote tumor development through three stages called elimination, balance and escape. During these stages, the tumor changes his immunogenicity and acquires immunosuppressive mechanisms that allow disease progression. Many studies have shown how several chemotherapy regimens can lead to a long-term change in immunological parameters, in particular to a depletion of the lymphocyte population [5] . We should add that cancer patients can present lymphopenia regardless of the ongoing treatments.",
