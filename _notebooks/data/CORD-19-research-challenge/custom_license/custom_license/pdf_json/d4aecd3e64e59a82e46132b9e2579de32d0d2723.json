Fear, anxiety, depression, psychological 9 symptoms, posttraumatic symptoms and general decrease in overall wellbeing were observed 10 (Wu et al., 2009). Isolation, high-risk working conditions, and direct contact with infected 11 individuals could become immediate factors of mental health problems in emergency frontline 12 nursing staff. The intense experience of infectious pandemic disease could have short-term and 13 long-term impact on the mental health of nursing staff in the absence of effective support and 14 timely training. The Pakistani government has made various attempts to reduce the pressure on 15 the nursing staff such as reducing workload by shift-system, introducing more nursing staff to 16 manage work pressure, recommending infection control measures, and advising personal 17 protective equipment and adherence to practical guidelines and standards. Additionally, 18 Pakistani government should establish psychological crisis intervention teams to provide 19 psychological services which include psychological counselling and psychotherapy, read-on and 20 listening materials and informative manuals (Mukhtar, 2020). In Pakistan where television news 21 and online media are prevalent and highly influential forms of entertainment in the lives of 22 community so information dissemination about coping mechanisms for psychological help 23 through these mediums would be more effective. Evidence based mental health services, efficacy 24 of psychological care, and the assessment of psychological care needs is necessary for nursing 25 staff (Kang et al., 2020). Continuous mental healthcare services are essential for even mild 26 psychological reactions during this pandemic to attenuate the possibility of escalating 27 psychological health problems (Rana, Mukhtar & Mukhtar, 2020). The number of medical 28 healthcare professionals (doctors, nurses, paramedics) suffering from mental health impacts after 29 epidemics and pandemics are often greater than the physical injury (Wang, Chen and Ye, 2020).",

Psychological counselling and 32 psychotherapy guidance could demonstrate effectiveness of psychological protection and 33 awareness for nursing staff through manuals (print media) and television (electronic media) 34 resources. Mental health of nursing staff can be effectively addressed and managed through 35 psychological counselling, convenient group sessions, and micromanagement of stress caused by 36 infectious disease' pandemic (Mukhtar, 2020). Psychological counselling sessions of nursing 37 staff could help in depersonalization, modifying life perspective, meaning of work, and 38 psychological reactions towards an adversity (West et al., 2014). Professional knowledge about 39 the risk of exposure and transmission of infectious diseases could offer a cautionary control over 40 the situation which in the case of COVID-19 is markedly different due to the pernicious 41 characteristics of novel coronavirus pandemic outbreak. 42 Many individuals' exhibit minimal symptoms while contagious and in asymptomatic 43 state or indirectly through skin contact involves a substantial risk of exposure for all medical, 44 nursing and paramedics professional transmitted the disease (Bai et al., 2020). The resultant 45 stress in this particular situation is evidently dissimilar with other epidemics and thus this 46 infectious risk indiscriminately affects large number of medical healthcare, paramedics and 47 nursing professionals both physical and psychologically. In Pakistan, immediate need of 48 addressing and recognizing mental health issues in nursing staff emerged from mobilizing a 49 psychological crisis intervention team on a large scale therapeutic response for psychological 50 support for frontline nurses, relieving stress, reducing fear and anxiety of infection, minimizing 51 psychosocial and behavioral changes brought by isolation (Rana, Mukhtar & Mukhtar, 2020). 52 Local nursing staff -at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak crisis -is pivotal for 53 the effective working of healthcare system so resources should be mobilized to ensure their 54 sound mental health. The training included self-protection, infectious disease pandemic 55 knowledge (epidemiological characteristics, transmission route of COVID-19 and clinical 56 diagnostic criteria and treatment), professional knowledge and skills, and preventive psychology 57 counselling (coping mechanisms, emotional distress management) training (videos, manuals, and 58 online guidance).",

Ensuring sound mental health would prevent the culture of learned 64 helplessness in nursing staff. Pakistan's government and hospital administration should make 65 every effort to manage and distribute personal protective equipment to doctors and nurses alike 66 to ensure their safety on frontline.
