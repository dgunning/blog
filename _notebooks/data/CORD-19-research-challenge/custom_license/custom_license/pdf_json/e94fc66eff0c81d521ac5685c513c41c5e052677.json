It is located outside the mainland on the southern coast of China, neighbouring Guangdong province-which has recorded the largest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 (1490 cases as of March 31, 2020) outside of Hubei. Having been one of the most heavily affected epicentres during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003, the community in Hong Kong has been prepared to respond to emerging infectious diseases. A range of public health measures have been implemented to delay and reduce local transmission of COVID-19, and there have been major changes in population behaviour.",

Once individuals are identified to be positive for COVID-19, they are isolated in hospital until they recover and cease virus shedding. Their close contacts are traced (from 2 days before illness onset) and quarantined in special facilities, including holiday camps and newly constructed housing estates.

The specific objective of this study was to quantify population behavioural changes in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 outbreak, and to describe the likely impact of the behavioural changes and public health measures on COVID-19 transmission and influenza transmission in the community.",

We obtained laboratory surveillance data from the Public Health Laboratory Services on influenza testing results on specimens from public hospitals and sentinel surveillance sites, including the weekly number of specimens tested and the number testing positive for influenza by type and subtype. Data on the current population of Hong Kong by age and sex were obtained from the Census and Statistics Department of the Hong Kong Government. We obtained the daily hospitalisation rates for influenza-positive cases among children in Hong Kong using the daily hospital admissions for influenza to the paediatric departments of two large hospitals in Hong Kong and the relevant catchment populations. 4 We did three cross-sectional telephone surveys among the general adult population in Hong Kong, on Jan 20-23, Feb 11-14, and March 10-13, 2020. The methods and survey instruments used were similar to those used for surveys during the SARS epidemic in 2003, 5,6 the influenza A H1N1 pandemic in 2009, 7 and the influenza A H7N9 outbreak in China in 2013. 8 Participants were recruited using random-digit dialling of both landline and mobile telephone numbers. Telephone numbers were randomly generated by a computer system. Calls were made during both working and non-working hours by trained interviewers to avoid over-representation of non-working groups. Respondents were required to be at least 18 for studies reporting the impact of alternative public health measures against COVID-19 using keywords including \"COVID-19\", \"2019-nCoV\", \"novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia\", \"SARS-CoV-2\", \"lockdown\", \"social distancing\", \"isolation\", \"contact tracing\", and \"quarantine\". We scanned 227 published studies and found six that estimated the impact of public health measures in Wuhan or elsewhere in mainland China, one study that described the early application of testing and contact tracing in Singapore, and one study reporting the impact of quarantine on transmission on the Diamond Princess cruise ship.",

We estimated changes in COVID-19 transmissibility over time via the effective reproduction number (R t ), which represents the mean number of secondary infections that result from a primary case of infection at time t. Values of R t exceeding 1 indicate that the epidemic will tend to grow, whereas values below 1 indicate that the epidemic will tend to decline. We estimated the timevarying reproduction numbers from serial intervals and incidence of COVID-19 cases over time, 9, 10 assuming a serial interval of 7\u00b75 days. 11 We extended the approach used by Thompson and colleagues 10 to allow for undetected cases due to censoring and imperfect detection of local cases. We assumed that 99% of imported cases and 80% of local cases would be detected. We developed a dataaugmented Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to jointly estimate the time-varying reproduction number, the delay dis tribution from onset to reporting which can be used to inform censoring and undetected cases. Timevarying estimates of reproduction numbers were made with a 7-day sliding window.",

This influenza proxy is a better correlate of the incidence of influenza virus infections in the community than either influenza-like illness rates or laboratory detection rates alone. 13 We interpolated daily influenza proxy values from the weekly influenza proxy values with use of flexible cubic splines. 14 Using the daily influenza proxy, we estimated daily transmissibility via the daily effective reproduction number, R t . We used a simple branching process model for epidemic spread to estimate the time-varying intensity of transmission. 15 We assumed the serial interval distribution for influenza followed a gamma distribution with a mean of 2\u00b785 days and SD of 0\u00b793 days. 16 We repeated these analyses for the daily influenza A H1N1 hospi talisation rates among children in two large local hospitals (Queen Mary Hospital and Princess Margaret Hospital). We evaluated the changes in transmissibility by comparing the R t values during the 2 weeks before and after the start of the school closures (including the Chinese New Year holidays) for the 2019-20 winter influenza season. The 95% CIs for the change in R t were calculated using Fieller's theorem. 17 We compared the reductions in 2019-20 with reductions in previous years when the Chinese New Year holidays occurred during influenza epidemics. All analyses were done with R version 3.6.2.",

The potentially higher basic reproduction number for COVID-19 indicates that it might be more difficult to control than influenza. 11 Because a variety of measures were used simultaneously, we were not able to disentangle the specific effects of each one, although this may become possible in the future if some measures are strengthened or relaxed locally, or with use of cross-national or subnational comparisons of the differential application of these measures. The estimated 44% reduction in influenza transmission in the general community in February, 2020, was much greater than the estimated 10-15% reduction in transmission associated with school closures alone during the 2009 pandemic, 18 and the 16% reduction in transmission of influenza B associated with school closures during the 2017-18 winter in Hong Kong. 19 We therefore estimate that the other social distancing measures and avoidance behaviours have had a substantial effect on influenza transmission in addition to the effect of school closures. However, if the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 in Hong Kong exceeds 2, (it was 2\u00b72 in Wuhan), 11 we would need more than a 44% reduction in COVID-19 transmission to completely avert a local epidemic.

It is likely that each plays a part. Unlinked cases have been identified in the community and will continue to be identified, indicating that not every chain of transmission has been identified by contact tracing from known cases. Although we have noted major effects of control measures and behavioural changes on influenza transmission, the effects could be of a different magnitude for COVID-19 because of differences in transmission dynamics. Second, our surveys of population behaviours could have been affected by response bias, because we relied on selfreported data. They also could have been affected by selection bias away from working adults, although this should have been reduced by conducting surveys in nonworking as well as working hours-we were unable to assess potential selection bias. Without a baseline survey before Jan 23, 2020, we could not compare changes in behaviours, although the results of similar surveys from previous epidemics can be used for comparison. [6] [7] [8] 11 Finally, although we identified reductions in the incidence of influenza virus infections in outpatients and paediatric inpatients, it is possible that these time series were affected by reduced health-care-seeking behaviours and limited health-care access that probably resulted from private clinic closure, which occurred around the period of the Chinese New Year holiday.",

Although the transmission dynamics and modes of transmission of COVID-19 have not been precisely elucidated, they are likely to share at least some characteristics with influenza virus transmission, because both viruses are directly transmissible respiratory pathogens with similar viral shedding dynamics. 23 The measures implemented in Hong Kong are less drastic than those used to contain transmission in mainland China, and are probably more feasible in many other locations worldwide. If these measures and population responses can be sustained, avoiding fatigue among the general population, they could meaningfully mitigate the impact of a local epidemic of COVID-19.",
