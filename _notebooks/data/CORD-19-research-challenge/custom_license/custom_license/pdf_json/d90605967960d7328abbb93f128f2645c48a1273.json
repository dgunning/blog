After removing visible bronchi, the lung tissue was minced into pieces of > 0.5 mm thickness using a tissue chopper and washed with balanced salt solution (BSS) containing Hanks' balanced salt solution (Gibco, USA) with 0.7 mM sodium bicarbonate (Gibco, USA) at pH 7.4 three times to partially remove macrophages and blood cells. The tissue was digested using a combination of 0.5% trypsin (Gibco, USA) and 4 U/ml elastase (Worthington Biochemical Corporation, USA) for 40 min at 37\u00b0C in a shaking water-bath. The digestion was stopped by adding DMEM/F12 medium (Gibco, USA) with 40% FBS in and DNase I (350 U/ml) (Sigma, USA). Cell clumps were dispersed by repeatedly pipetting the cell suspension for 10 min. A disposable cell strainer (gauze size of 50 \uf06dm) (BD Bioscience, USA) was used to separate large undigested tissue fragments. The single cell suspension in the flow-through was centrifuged and resuspended in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM/F12 medium and small airway basal medium (SABM) (Lonza, USA) supplemented with 0.5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (hEGF), 500 ng/ml epinephrine, 10 \u03bcg/ml transferrin, 5 \u03bcg/ml insulin, 0.1 ng/ml retinoic acid, 6.5 ng/ml triiodothyronine, 0.5 \u03bcg/ml hydrocortisone, 30 \u03bcg/ml bovine pituitary extract and 0.5 mg/ml BSA together with 5% FBS and 350 U/ml DNase I. The cell suspension was plated on a tissue culture grade plastic flask (Corning, USA) and incubated in a 37\uf0b0C water-jacketed incubator with 5% CO 2 supply for 90 min. The nonadherent cells were layered on a discontinuous cold Percoll density gradient (densities 1.089 and 1.040 g/ml) and centrifuged at 25\u00d7g for 20 min without brake. The cell layer at the interface of the two gradients was collected and washed four times with BSS to remove the Percoll. The cell suspension was incubated with magnetic beads coated with anti-CD14 antibodies at room temperature (RT) for 20 min under constant mixing. After the removal of the beads using a magnet (MACS CD14 MicroBeads), cell viability was assessed by trypanblue exclusion. The purified pneumocyte suspension was resuspended in small airway growth medium (Lonza, USA) supplemented with 1% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin and plated at a cell density of 3\uf0b410 5 cells/cm 2 . The cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO 2 , 37\u00b0C) under liquid-covered conditions and growth medium was changed daily starting from 60 h after plating the cells. When the cell layer approached 75% confluence, the pneumocytes were trypsinised and detached into Hank's buffered saline solution Isolation and culture of primary human peripheral blood monocyte derived macrophages Peripheral blood leucocytes were separated from buffy coats of healthy blood donors from the Hong Kong Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service by centrifugation on a Ficoll-Paque density gradient and monocytes were purified by adherence on plastic petri dishes as described previously 3 . Monocytes were seeded onto tissue culture plates in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated autologous plasma. The purity of the monocyte preparations was confirmed by immunostaining for the surface receptor CD14 (BD Biosciences, USA). Cells were allowed to differentiate for 14 days in vitro before use. Culture medium was changed to macrophage serum free medium SFM (Gibco, USA) a week before infection. Ex vivo culture of human respiratory tract Fresh biopsies of human bronchus, lung parenchyma, tonsil and/or nasopharynx obtained from patients undergoing surgical resection of lung tissue at Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery or Ear Nose & Throat surgery, The University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital as part of clinical care but surplus for routine diagnostic requirements were used in this study. All the studies were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong and Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster. For the ex vivo cultures of human lung and bronchus, the age range of the donors from Hong Kong providing bronchus and lung tissues was from age of 51 to 65 years. The lung tissue fragments were placed into culture medium (F-12K nutrient mixture with L-glutamine, and antibiotics) in 24-well tissue culture plates incubated at 37 o C. The tonsil, nasopharyngeal and bronchial biopsies or tissue fragments were placed into culture medium (F-12K nutrient mixture with L-glutamine, and antibiotics) incubated at 37 o C or 33 o C as indicated. The tonsil, nasopharyngeal and bronchial tissues were incubated with a sterile surgical pathology sponge to establish an air-liquid interface condition in 24-well culture plates.Infection of human pneumocytes and peripheral blood monocyte derived macrophages in vitroHuman pneumocytes and macrophages cultures were infected with influenza A viruses at a MOI of two for the analysis of cytokine and chemokine expression. MEM medium (Gibco, USA) with 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 \uf06dg/ml streptomycin was used as inoculum in the mock infected cells. The cell cultures were incubated with the virus inoculum for one hour in a water-jacketed 37\u00b0C incubator with 5% CO 2 . The cells were rinsed three times with warm PBS and replenished with the appropriate growth medium. The infected cells were harvested for mRNA collection at 3, 8 and 24 hpi for macrophages and 1, 6 and 24 hpi for pneumocytes.",

Desialylation was carried out by incubating the cells with either 500U/ml of sialidase, DAS181 (NexBio,USA) or 20mU/ml of Sialidase S (Prozyme, USA) at 37 o C for 2h. The treated 1% TRBC were then washed with cold PBS by centrifugation at 2000 rpm until the supernatant was clear and then resuspended in PBS to 0.5% for haemagglutination assay.Serial two-fold dilutions of virus using PBS were performed in a U-bottom 96 well plate in triplicate. PBS served as negative control of the HA assay. Equal volumes of control (untreated) or sialidase pre-treated 0.5% TRBC were added to the diluted viruses. After 20 min of incubation at room temperature, the plates were read. A red button formed in the negative control. HA titer of each treatment was recorded as a reciprocal of the highest titre that gave haemagglutination.Immunohistochemical stainingImmunohistochemical staining of the respiratory tract tissue was carried out for the influenza nucleoprotein as follows. The tissue sections with incubated with 0.05% Pronase (Roche, Switzerland) in 0.1% CaCl 2 pH 7.8 at 37 \uf0b0C for 2 min, blocked with 3% H 2 O 2 in TBS for 10 min followed by treatment with an avidin/biotin blocking kit (Vector Lab, USA).

Antibodies to CD68 for macrophages and surfactant protein D (Abcam, UK) for type II pneumocytes were used for consecutive slide labeling. Quantification of cytokine and chemokine mRNA profile by RT-qPCR Primary human pneumocytes and peripheral blood-derived macrophages were infected with influenza A viruses at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of two. mRNA from infected cells was extracted using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) and treated with DNase. cDNA was synthesized with Oligo-dT primers and Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, USA) and quantified by real-time PCR amplification using ABI 7500 PCR system (Applied Biosystem, USA). The gene expression profiles of the influenza viral matrix 1 gene; cytokines TNF-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-29, interferon \u03b2 (IFN\u03b2); chemokines CXCL10, RANTES, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b2 and interferon stimulated genes Mx1 were quantified and normalized using the housekeeping gene \u03b2-actin mRNA at the time points stated above. The primers and methods used for these assays have been reported previously 1, 4, 8 . RT 2 Profiler PCR array (PAHS-064Z, SABioscience, Qiagen, Germany) is used for the detection of mRNA level of human interferons and receptors. Master-mix composed of Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystem, USA) and cDNA prepared from 500 ng total RNA extracted from macrophages at 24hpi was subjected to real-time PCR amplification for 40 cycles using ABI 7500 PCR system (Applied Biosystem, USA). Gene expression and statistical analysis were calculated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantification of cytokine and chemokine proteins in infected culture supernatants by ELISA Protein expression levels of CXCL10, IL-8, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1, RANTES, in the virusfree cell supernatant collected from influenza viruses infected alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages were quantitatively determined by ELISA assay as recommended by the manufacturer (R&D Systems, USA). In brief, cells infected with different strains of influenza viruses and cell culture supernatants were collected at 24 hpi. 100 \u00b5l of supernatant from each sample was processed according to the manufacturer's protocol.
