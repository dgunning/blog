In our IBD cohort, we did not report any case of COVID-19, and in particular no patient was admitted to hospital with SARS-CoV-2 proven infection. More than a half of our patients (59%) were exclusively on salicylates treatment. Patients on immunosuppressive treatments such as thiopurines or methotrexate, steroids or other immunosuppressants (22% of our cohort) and patients on biologic treatment (Infliximab, Adalimumab, Vedolizumab and Ustekinumab, Golimumab) (16 %) continued their current dosage without noting any symptoms leading to diagnose COVID-19. Over the same period, 479 patients without history of IBD were admitted to the hospital because of severe COVID-19, after presenting to our emergency department with respiratory failure.",

The recent onset of this pandemic outbreak, which is still ongoing, and the lack of epidemiologically robust data, preclude us from drawing certain conclusions regarding its incidence and its effects in specific populations of patients. However, if we base our calculation on a mathematical model applied to the Wuhan region, which estimated a 86% undocumented cases, we could speculate that in Bergamo province a total of 46.220 patients were infected by SARS-CoV-2, accounting for 4% of the total population 4 . From this model we could estimate that 21 cases among our IBD cohort should have been infected.
