One of fifty-74 two presidents, Dennis Phelps (2003), was from a private/community practice while the 75 remaining presidents were from academic institutions. 94% (49/52) of presidents were from the 76 USA and 6% (3/52) from Canada. 77",

The most common speech theme 80 overall was \"how to be a good hand surgeon\" (16/52 speeches or 31%). The most common 81 theme of ASSH presidential addresses from the 1960s to today was how to train physicians and 82 hand surgeons. In the 1960's, the most common speech theme was \"history and the current state 83 of ASSH\" (Figure 2) . In the 1970's and 80's, both \"assessments of how to be a good surgeon\" 84 and \"goals for ASSH\" were the most popular topics of discussion (Figure 2) . In the 1990's, 85 \"healthcare and governmental regulation\" was the most common theme, often in conjunction 86 with discussion of healthcare bills proposed by the Clinton administration (Figure 2) . In the 87 2000's, the most common theme was \"how to be a better hand surgeon\". Finally, in the 2010's 88 \"Goals for ASSH\" was the most common discussed topic. Additionally, themes discussing the 89 concept of work-life balance were introduced only in the 1990s and became more prevalent 90 throughout the 2010's (Figure 2) . 91",

The 35 founders of the ASSH consisted of 13 plastic 123 surgeons, 14 general surgeons and 8 orthopedic surgeons.3  In 2016, the percentage of orthopedic 124 surgeons, plastic surgeons, and general surgeons in the ASSH was 78%, 16% and 5% 125 respectively which is similar to ratio of ASSH past presidents of 67% orthopedic surgeons, 25% 126 plastic surgeons, and 8% general surgeons. 5 There has been an overall decrease in the percentage 127 of plastic surgeons in hand surgery over time. This may likely be the trend in the future and 128 largely reflects the relative makeup of the hand society in general. Some suggest that the 129 percentage of plastic surgeons in hand surgery has decreased because plastic surgery residents 130 are deterred by the lower reimbursements compared to other plastic surgery sub-specialties. 5 131",

In this role, founded 34 nine hand surgery centers at United States Army general hospitals focused on education, 35 training, and the treatment of hand ailments. 3 To facilitate the exchange of ideas between the 36 different centers, Bunnell and 34 hand surgery colleagues met in Chicago on January 20, 1946 37 immediately before the annual meeting of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Dr. 38 Bunnell's passion for the collaboration and unification of hand surgery became the impetus for 39 the creation of the ASSH in 1946. This set the stage for the first ASSH meeting where Bunnell 40 served as the first President (1946-1947). Dr. Bunnell's passion for the collaboration and 41 unification of hand surgery became the impetus for the creation of the ASSH in 1946. As the 42 first president of the ASSH, Dr. Bunnell set a precedent for future leaders in hand surgery to 43 emphasize the mission of the ASSH: to advance the science and practice of hand and upper 44 extremity surgery through education, research, and advocacy on behalf of patients and 45practitioners. 4 Initially, only 11 new members were admitted to ASSH in any year. 4 However, a more inclusive membership philosophy was adopted in the early 1970s, ensuring more widespread access to quality hand care throughout North America. Since its inception in 1946, 48Over time, the evolution of hand surgery has paralleled the general specialization of other 50 medical fields. Our knowledge about hand surgery has grown significantly over the years, as has 51 ASSH has a total of 4,673 active members today. Previous presidents of the ASSH have been 52 respected as leaders, collaborators, and inspirational individuals who prioritize and reflect the 53 goals of the hand society. The president of the Hand Society motivates the ASSH council to 54 further the objectives established by the society's strategic plan. 1 55The advances made in hand surgery understanding and technique are well documented. 58",

Studies on 138 physician burnout and suicide began to raise awareness around work-life balance and the 139 importance of surgeons caring for themselves, and this should continue to remain a focus long 140 term. Surgeons with burnout are at increased risk for cynicism, depression, and physical illness 141 such as heart disease. 6 Several orthopedic surgery studies published in the 2000s have reported 142 burnout rates of 40%-60%. 6-8 In 2016, it was reported that the age-adjusted rate of suicide 143 among Americans was 13 in 100,000 compared to the suicide rate among physicians in the 144 United States at nearly double that: 28-40 physicians in 100,000. 9 Speeches in the past two 145 decades have focused more on holistically developing the hand surgeon, as will likely be shared 146 goals amongst members and leadership moving forward.

This review aimed to 152 reflect on the distance travelled in hand surgery and to understand trends in the goals and 153 composition of the ASSH. Revisiting the history of the ASSH and the goals of its leadership 154 allows us to reflect on the progress we've made, while recognizing likely future trends and 155 common goals that are important to our society moving forward. Over the last 74 years, the 156 ASSH has provided exemplary leadership in the field of hand and upper extremity surgery. 157Major strides have been made in the last decade, with advances in outreach (Touching Hands  158 project), a ten-fold return on investment of the AFSH's funding of research, launching of a 159 knowledge platform (HAND-e) that is providing hand surgery education around the world, and a",
