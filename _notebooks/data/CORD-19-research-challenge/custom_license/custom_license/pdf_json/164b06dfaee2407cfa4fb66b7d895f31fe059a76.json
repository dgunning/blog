            "text": "Background: Acute viral respiratory infections represent a globally important cause of morbidity and mortality in childhood. An individual's cellular response appears to play a critical role in recovery from infections, given that individuals with impaired cellular immunity, congenital or acquired, have more severe diseases and secrete the virus for longer periods. Objectives: The aim of this study was to immunohistochemically evaluate the expression of the cell surface antigens CD4, CD8, CD25, CD14 and CD74, in pneumonic infiltrates in the alveolar septa using paraffinembedded lung samples from autopsies of immunocompetent children who died of lethal, non-pandemic, severe acute respiratory infections. Study design: From 794 cases of pediatric autopsies of patients with severe respiratory disease (between 1960 and 2004), 193 cases were selected for this study. To identify subpopulations of inflammatory cells in the alveolar septa, cell surface antigen expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry using the following primary antibodies: anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti-CD14, anti-CD25 and anti-CD74. Results: The TCD8+ lymphocyte count was higher in the virus-positive group (p = 0.04) and was also much higher among cases that were positive for more than three viral types (p = 0.016). There were fewer CD14+ cells in cases of AdV (adenovirus) infection (p = 0.002), and there was a predominance of CD74+ cells in the histopathological pattern defined as interstitial pneumonitis (p = 0.037). Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate that TCD8+ lymphocytes present in the alveolar septa participate to a greater extent in the response toward viral pneumonia, while CD14+ cell numbers are often reduced in cases of AdV.",

After natural infection, normal children respond with the proliferation of specific TCD8+ (cytotoxic) lymphocytes, suggesting the stimulation of T cells. Both T lymphocytes, TCD4+ and TCD8+, are involved in RSV replication during infection. In rats, the TCD8+ (cytotoxic) lymphocytes are responsible for the elimination of virus in the lungs. However, paradoxically, they appear to increase symptom severity. The same has been observed with TCD4+ (helper) lymphocytes, which have a protective role and may simultaneously increase disease severity. The predominant stimulation of Th2 lymphocytes may be associated with the occurrence of diseases with increased severity [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] .",

Stillbirths, neonatal deaths and children with immunodeficiencies were also excluded from the total sample (n = 794 -1960-2004) . The ages of the individuals included in this study ranged from one month to 14 years of age, and the cases were divided into two groups: up to 1 year and over 1 year. The dates of the deaths were used to define seasonality, which was divided into warm and cold months. The anatomopathological patterns of the 193 samples of this study were reviewed in sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin and were classified as either bronchopneumonia or interstitial pneumonitis [18, 19] .",

There was a predominance of deaths in the colder months (63%) compared to the warmer months (37%). Of the respiratory viruses, RSV showed the most characteristic seasonality, which has already been well documented in studies in developed and developing countries [18, 19, 23] . Bronchopneumonia was the most common histopathologic pattern, representing 78% of the total sample. Classically, bronchopneumonia and lobar pneumonia are histopathological patterns described in lung infections caused by bacteria. However, numerous studies have shown that respiratory viruses alone or concomitant viral-bacterial infections can also be etiologic agents of these findings. Thus, when a patient's morphologic pattern is characteristic of the bacterial etiology of lung infections, the existence of viral concomitance is also likely in these cases, as it is believed that respiratory viruses can favor the entry and spread of bacteria, both locally and systemically [18, 19, 24] .",

            "text": "One of the reasons for the observations of high numbers of cells expressing CD74 and CD14 is the fact that most cases in this study involved patients with bronchopneumonia, which was most likely purely bacterial or concomitantly viral. In our samples, the cells that expressed CD74, an MHC class II marker, were mainly B lymphocytes, histiocytes and macrophages, while those cells that expressed CD14, a general monocyte marker, were mainly histiocytes and macrophages. Bronchopneumonia, which is usually bacterial, has a lesion pattern that is mainly characterized by neutrophilic exudation. Neutrophils are attracted to the focus of infection through chemotactic cytokines released by immune cells, mainly macrophages and B lymphocytes, which generally differentiate subsequent to MHC class II bacterial antigen presentation. Moreover, by immunohistochemistry, most cases did not show viral markers, and the bronchopneumonia pattern was predominant. This observation leads us to believe that these cases had been treated for pure bacterial pneumonia. This is characterized by high concentrations of neutrophils in the acute phase, an inflammatory response mainly mediated by MHC class II, and a resolution phase mediated by CD14+ and CD74+ histiocytes. Another interesting point is that as these were cases of patients who had already died, the hospitalization time was relatively high (average of 13 days), regardless of the histopathological pattern found. Accordingly, in these patients, standard pulmonary pathology that was already in the resolution phase, with large amounts of CD14+ and CD74+ histiocytes, was common. This observation would explain the overall prevalence of these markers in this study, even though the differences between the groups with or without virus were not statistically significant [6, [11] [12] [13] [26] [27] [28] .",

Respiratory viruses are capable of inducing hyper-responsiveness in the airways by activating both Th1 and Th2 responses, with the Th1 response usually being predominant. Accordingly, staining with anti-CD8 antibody revealed a greater number of TCD8+ lymphocytes in virus-positive cases, indicating the prevalence of the activation and proliferation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, suggesting a Th1-type immune response. There is controversy in the literature regarding the immune response mediated by TCD8+ lymphocytes. Other studies have shown that the Th1 response is of fundamental importance in RSV pathogenesis. Subsequently, Thorburn [29] showed that RSV inhibits the expression of TCD8+ lymphocytes in the pulmonary parenchyma and the development of TCD8+ memory cells, as RSV seems to interfere with receptor signaling in these cells. Corroborating these data, in this study, we also found that there were large numbers of TCD4+ lymphocytes and CD4+ macrophages in lung samples, indicating the involvement of the Th2 response. Such an immune response mechanism may be due to the predominance of positive RSV cases in this study, which could have interfered with the final counts of these inflammatory cells for the virus-positive group.",
