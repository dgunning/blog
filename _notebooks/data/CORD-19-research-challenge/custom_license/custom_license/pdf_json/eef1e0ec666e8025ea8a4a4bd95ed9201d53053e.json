Severely ill COVID-19 patients often require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. The choice of drugs to sedate these patients differs widely depending on drug availability and clinical expertise. We suggest that care providers with the appropriate clinical expertise, consider the use of inhalational anesthetic drugs, such as sevoflurane and isoflurane for the following reasons.",

Not surprisingly, there is a growing shortage of these drugs. Also, studies of patients with severe lung injury from causes other than COVID-19 have shown that inhalational anesthetic drugs improve oxygenation and lower mortality when compared with propofol or midazolam [1] . The severity of lung injury in COVID-19 patients correlates with levels of cytokines and viral load. Convincing preclinical data from others and us have shown that inhalational anesthetic drugs attenuate lung inflammation and dilate airways [2, 3] . These effects are mediated by \uf067-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA A ) receptors, which are expressed in different types of cells in the lung. Stimulating GABA A receptors in lung epithelial cells reduces the production of proinflammatory cytokines;",

Conventionally, anesthetic drug delivery units and gas scavenging systems that reduce atmospheric pollution are not available in most critical care units. However, operating rooms which contain the equipment, are being converted into critical care units and anesthetic gas machines are being used as ICU ventilators during the surge of COVID-19 cases [5] .
