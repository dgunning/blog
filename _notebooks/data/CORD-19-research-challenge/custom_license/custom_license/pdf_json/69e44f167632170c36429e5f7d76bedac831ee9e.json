It is a zoonotic disease with person-to-person transmission through droplet or contact transmission (Wu et al., 2019) . Infected people can transmit the disease before they present clinical symptoms (Rothe et al., 2020) . This is the main reason that the disease could swiftly spread from Wuhan, China to various corners of the globe. More recently, the epicenter of the diseases appears to have shifted from Wuhan, China to the European world and mainly Italy, and United States of America (World Health Organization, 2020). Many countries including China, Italy, Saudi Arabia, New Zealand, Poland, Ireland, Denmark, Spain, France have cancelled international flights and implemented the world's largest and most restrictive quarantines policies to minimize the further transmission and disease burden. For the prevention of the spread of the disease, these countries are not permitting people to enter or leave the country without strict screening of the passenger for Covid-2019 infection at airports. (Quilty et al., (2020) evaluated the usefulness of thermal passenger screening for COVID-19 infection at airports exit and entry points. The authors found that effectiveness of entry screening was dependent on the effectiveness of the exit screening at the destination. The authors identified that 46% of the infected travelers were not detected, because of the incubation period, and asymptomatic or subclinical cases (Chan et al., 2020) . (Quilty et al., 2020) also reported that airport screening is unlikely to detect a sufficient proportion of COVID-19 infected travelers. The screening is intended to be a barrier for preventing infected people from entering into the country; however, evidence of its effectiveness remains limited. These are reasons that health officials are still unable to control the spread of this contagious disease. The transmission of the disease is closely linked to the asymptomatic and infected people and those visiting the countries with COVID-19 pandemic. (Figure 4) . The disease is still spreading with mutable prevalence and mortality outbreak trends.",

The number of cases were proportional to the number of deaths. There was a great fluctuation in the biological and epidemiological trends both in the growth factor of number of cases and the mortality rates. Global health officials have taken high priority measures to prevent the further outbreaks of this emerging pathogen across the globe, but still the coronavirus COVID-19 is swiftly spreading with mutable biological trends. The rising number of cases and mortality risk estimates are demonstrating the dire need for enhanced public health mediations, good hygienic conditions, social distancing and movement limitations to control the COVID-19 epidemics.",
