RNA was isolated from the distal part of the mid-intestine of Atlantic cod and suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) was employed to screen for genes that showed changes in expression in response to the two dietary treatments. We made a cDNA subtracted library, isolated and sequenced 192 clones. Identification of 157 clones was predicted by BLAST. Most of the clones were previously unidentified in cod. Expression of 12 selected clones was further studied by quantitative PCR. Expression of four clones showing similarity to aminopeptidase N, transcobalamin I precursor, cytochrome P450 3A40, and ras-related nuclear protein was significantly up regulated in intestine of cod fed SBM compared to cod fed FM. A trend towards up regulation of a clone with similarity to fatty acid binding protein in SBM-fed cod was also observed. No significant differences in expression were observed for: transmembrane 4 superfamily protein member, polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, glutathione peroxidase, peroxiredoxin 4, SEC61, F-BOX, and 14-3-3.",

Salmon and trout are no longer the only fish species, as a diversity of aquatic species and organisms are being developed for use in aquaculture. To achieve sustainable growth in aquaculture, a replacement of raw materials from marine sources with vegetable sources seems necessary. Extracted soybean meals (SBM) are regarded as potentially very good protein ingredients for fish feeds, and represent the main plant protein source on the world market. However, legumes like soybeans contain high amounts of different bioactive components like protease inhibitors, lipase inhibitors, phytic acid, saponins, and lectins (Krogdahl, 1989) . Soybean meal has already become an important protein source in fish feeds, but due to a wide range of adverse effects soy products are only included at low levels in diets for farmed salmonids.",

As wild Atlantic cod is considered a strict carnivorous species, formulated feeds have in general been made from marine protein and lipid sources. Few reports are available studying addition of soybean protein sources to cod diets. However, indications exist that cod is more tolerant to dietary inclusions of soybean protein sources compared to salmonids. In a study by von der Decken and Lied (1993) juvenile cod (40 g) were fed increasing inclusion levels of soybean protein sources. In this study replacement of 10 and 20% of total protein did not affect feed intake and growth whereas a decrease was observed at 30% replacement of total protein. In the same study, changes in muscle metabolic functions, measured as acid proteinase activity, glycogen and myofibrillar RNA content and myosin heavy chain mRNA levels were altered before measurable changes in growth were observed.",

Both soy products replaced 24% of the total protein in the FM diet and all three diets were fed to small (534 g) and large (1750 g) fish. There was no difference between diets with respect to weight gain within the two size groups, nor any general effect of diet on growth measured as thermal growth coefficient (TGC). The soy products reduced the digestibility of amino acids and lipid in both size groups, but this was, however, compensated for by increased feed intake and gastrointestinal growth. Bioprocessing of the SBM did not improve the nutritional value, indicating that cod has a high tolerance to SBM compared to salmonids.",

This kit was used to produce high quality cDNA from a small sample. Part VII and VIII of this protocol are designed for synthesizing cDNA for applications such as PCR-Select \u2122 cDNA subtraction or Virtual Northern blots. Briefly, 1 \u03bcg of total RNA was combined with 12 \u03bcM of the primers 3\u2032 BD SMART CDS primer II A (a modified oligo dT primer) and BD SMART II A oligonucleotide, respectively, and incubated at 70\u00b0C for 2 min, before addition of first-strand buffer, DTT, dNTPs, and BD Powerscript Reverse Transcriptase according to the manufacturer's protocol. The RNA was then reversely transcribed for 1 h at 42\u00b0C to synthesize single stranded (ss) cDNA. After this, the ss cDNA was diluted in 40 \u03bcl of TE buffer (10 mM Tris (pH 7.6), 1 mM EDTA), and heated at 72\u00b0C for 7 min. Subsequently, 1 \u03bcl of the diluted ss cDNA was used in long distance (LD) PCR, while the remaining (49 \u03bcl) was stored at \u221220\u00b0C until further use. LD PCR was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol, and an optimal number of cycles determined for each sample. Each step of the protocol was monitored by gel electrophoresis of aliquots of samples. The LD PCR was terminated by the addition of 5 \u03bcl of 20X EDTA/glycogen Mix (0.2 M EDTA; 1 mg/ml glycogen) from the Clontech PCR-Select \u2122 cDNA subtraction kit (BD Clontech, Cat. no. 637401). Instead of performing column chromatography according to part VIII of the SMART cDNA synthesis kit protocol, we performed precipitation of the LD PCR (approximately 86 \u03bcl after gel electrophoresis) according to the PCR-Select \u2122 cDNA subtraction kit protocol, part IV D7.",

The steps following precipitation were also performed exactly according to the protocol. Briefly, the cDNAs were subsequently digested with Rsa I, precipitated again, and dissolved in H 2 O, and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until further use. For the SSH procedure, cDNA from FM-fed fish was defined as the \"driver\" cDNA, and cDNA from SBM-fed fish defined as the \"tester\" cDNA. 1 \u03bcl of Rsa I-digested tester cDNA (from SBM-fed fish) was then ligated to either adaptor 1 or adaptor 2R at 16\u00b0C overnight (ON), and then terminated by addition of EDTA/glycogen and heating at 72\u00b0C for 5 min. Subsequently the tester cDNA with adaptor 1 was hybridized with an excess of the driver cDNA (from FM-fed fish) in tube 1, while tester cDNAwith adaptor 2R was hybridized with an excess of driver cDNA in tube 2 at 68\u00b0C for 8 h (first hybridization), immediately followed by the second hybridization in which tube 1 and 2 from the first hybridization was combined with addition of fresh denatured driver cDNA (subtraction kit protocol, part IV-H), and incubated further at 68\u00b0C ON. The following day 200 \u03bcl of dilution buffer was added to the sample, followed by heating to 68\u00b0C for 7 min. The diluted sample was subsequently stored at \u221220\u00b0C until further analysis. Differentially expressed cDNAs were selectively amplified by two subsequent PCR steps, the first using a PCR primer 1 complementary to both adaptors, and the second using two nested primers complementary to each of the two adaptors (nested PCR primer 1 and nested PCR primer 2R) respectively, according to the manufacturer's protocol (section IV, I-1 to I-17). In this way the final PCR mixture was enriched for differentially expressed cDNAs. A subtraction efficiency test was performed as a control according to the manufacturer's protocol.",

The function of APN varies with its location. In intestinal brush border APN is involved in terminal degradation of basic or neutral amino acids, as well as processing of the neuropeptides and peptide hormones involved in the regulation of growth and differentiation in the gastrointestinal tract (Riemann et al., 1993; Carl-McGrath et al., 2004) . In mammals/humans, expression of APN has been shown to be dys-regulated in inflammatory diseases and cancers, and APN has also been shown to serve as a receptor for coronaviruses (Bauvois and Dauzonne, 2006) . In monocytes, expression of APN has been shown to be regulated by cytokines like TGF-\u03b2 and IL-10 ( Kehlen et al., 2004) , and IFN\u03b3 (Gabrilovac et al., 2005) . Likewise, in fibroblasts APN has also been shown to up regulated by both cytokines and glucocorticoids (Sorrell et al., 2003) . In comparison, reports on regulation of APN gene expression in intestinal epithelial cells are scarce. Although separate promotors control transcription of APN in myeloid and intestinal epithelial cells, both aminopeptidase N transcripts encode the same polypeptide (Shapiro et al., 1991) . In human fetus and children tributyrin and butyric acid have been shown to inhibit the activity of APN (Kushak and Winter, 1999) . Butyric acid may be produced by fermentation of dietary fiber by intestinal microflora, and replacing FM with SBM increases the amount of intestinal fiber available to the microflora. The Atlantic cod gut microbiota has been shown to be sensitive to dietary changes (Ring\u00f8 et al., 2006; Refstie et al., 2006b) . This may indicate that mRNA expression of APN is up regulated to compensate for a putative inhibition caused by increased amounts of butyric acid produced by intestinal microflora.",

Transcobalamins (I, II, and III) are transporters for cobalamin (cbl)/vitamin B12 in plasma (Hall, 1975) . TCI and TCIII are now commonly referred to as haptocorrin (HC) (Afman et al., 2001) . In mammals, HC (TCI and TCIII) binds vitamin B12 in saliva, and upon proteolysis in the duodenum vitamin B12 is transferred to intrinsic factor (IF), and this complex is taken up in the distal ileum via the IF-vitamin B12 receptor. Vitamin B12 is subsequently bound to TCII and released into circulation for transport and uptake into various tissues (Afman et al., 2001; Wuerges et al., 2006) . Vitamin B12 is synthesized exclusively by microorganisms in one of the most complex biosynthetic pathways found in nature (Raux et al., 2000) , and intestinal absorption, blood transport, and delivery to tissues is therefore essential in mammals. Two derivatives of vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin) act as coenzymes for methionine synthase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, respectively (Wolters et al., 2004; Wuerges et al., 2006) . Information about vitamin B12 transport in fish is scarce. In GenBank, partial mRNA sequences for transcobalamin I and II precursors in killifish have been submitted (acc.nos. CV822982, CN984169, and more). In channel catfish, vitamin B12 synthesis and direct absorption from the intestine have been shown (Limsuwan and Lovell, 1981) .",

The expression of intestinal CYP3A in fish has been less studied. However, the intestine has been shown to be the major extrahepatic site of expression of various CYP3A isoforms in rainbow trout (Lee et al., 1998 (Lee et al., , 2001 , killifish (Hegelund and Celander, 2003) and zebrafish (Tseng et al., 2005) . The expression of CYP3A40 mRNA has been identified in liver of the fish species medaka (Kullman and Hinton, 2001) , but information regarding distribution and induction of this isoform is scarce. Soy contains several phytochemicals such as isoflavons and phytosterols that could potentially induce the expression of CYP3A40 mRNA in the SBM group of the present study. The diet has been indicated to influence the amount of CYP3A-like proteins in the intestine of channel catfish (James et al., 2005) but is not known if this is followed by a concurrent change in mRNA expression. In mouse dexamethasone has been shown to increase the expression of five different isoforms of CYP3A at both the mRNA and protein level (Zhang et al., 2003) .",

Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) may be divided in cytosolic FAPBs and FABPs associated with the plasma membrane. Cytosolic FABPs (FABPc) can be defined as transport proteins (Storch and Thumser, 2000) . FABPc have been shown to facilitate fatty acid (FA) uptake and transport by increasing rate of dissociation from the plasma membrane by enhancing the aqueous solubility of FAs (Vork et al., 1993) , or improve transfer to acceptor membranes (Hsu and Storch, 1996) as reviewed by Chmurzynska (2006) . In regulation of lipid metabolism, FAs can act as signalling molecules triggering activation of transcription factors. Several FABPs have been shown to interact with members of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) family of nuclear receptors (Wolfrum et al., 2001; Tan et al., 2002) , which are known to regulate the transcription of many genes involved in lipid metabolism (Gregoire et al., 1998; Chmurzynska, 2006) . Intestinal FABP (I-FABP) gene expression have been shown to be modulated directly by FA (Hallden et al., 1994; Le et al., 1997; Poirier et al., 1997) , and by the gut regulatory peptide PYY (Hallden and Aponte, 1997; Aponte, 2002) . In addition, epidermal growth factor (EGF) has been shown to down regulate expression of I-FABP in Caco2 cells (Darimont et al., 1999) . Lipid digestibility was significantly reduced in cod fed the SBM diet (Refstie et al., 2006a) . Hence the concentration of FAs in the intestinal content was increased. A higher level of FAs in intestinal content could potentially induce an up regulation of FABP in the intestinal wall.",

The majority of the clones represented new sequences in Atlantic cod that to our knowledge have not previously been described or annotated in GenBank. By quantitative real-time PCR we showed a significant up regulation in mRNA expression of four different clones showing similarity to aminopeptidase N (terminal intestinal degradation of amino acids), transcobalamin I precursor (vitamin B12 transport), cytochrome P450 3A40 (oxidative metabolism of drugs, environmental chemicals and endogenous compounds), and ras-related nuclear protein (regulation of cell cycle) in intestine of cod fed SBM compared to cod fed FM. A definite trend towards up regulation of a clone with similarity to fatty acid binding protein (FABP) in cod fed SBM was also observed. No significant difference in expression was observed for the seven other clones studied: transmembrane 4 superfamily protein member (TM4), polypeptide N-acetylgalactoaminyltransferase (ppGaNTase), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), peroxiredosin 4 (Prx4), SEC61, F-BOX, and 14-3-3.",
