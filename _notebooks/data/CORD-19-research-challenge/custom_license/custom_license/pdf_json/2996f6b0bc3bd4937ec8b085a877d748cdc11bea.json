This review describes the latest MERS-CoV clusters and the first cases of nosocomial transmission within health care facilities in Oman. We have highlighted lessons learned and proposed steps to prevent healthcare-associated infections. Methods: A descriptive analysis of MERS-CoV cases was conducted between January 23 and February 16, 2019. The data from officials and other published sources used. Results: Thirteen laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV were reported from three simultaneous clusters from two governorates without an epidemiological link between the clusters. Two clusters were reported from North Al Batinah Governorate, with nine cases (69%) and 1 cluster from South Ash Sharqiyah Governorate with four cases (31%). In total, four deaths were reported (case fatality rate 31%). Four cases (31%) reported were household contacts from the first cluster, 3 (23%) were nosocomial transmission in health care facilities (two for first and one from the second cluster) and 7 (54%) were community-acquired cases. Conclusions: The first local clusters of MERS-CoV reported with evidence suggestive of healthcare and household-associated transmission. Early diagnosis and strict implementation of infection control measures remain fundamental in preventing and managing MERS-CoV infection.",

Following reports of MERS-CoV infections from the Ara-bian Peninsula, cases were likewise reported from travelers visiting other continents [2] . Dromedary camels, in which the virus does not cause disease, are believed to be the major host reservoir [3, 4] . The virus can spread from dromedary camels to humans through direct or indirect contact, causing significant morbidity and mortality [4] . The clinical spectrum ranges from asymptomatic illness to septic shock, multi-organ failure and death in severe cases [5] . Evidence suggests that the average incubation period in an infected human host is 5.5-6.5 days with a maximum of 10-14 days [6] .",

The information collected included baseline demographic characteristics (time, place, gender, age, residency and nationality), risk factors including history of previous exposure to camels, co-morbidities, laboratory investigations, clinical management and outcomes including mortality rates. A comprehensive investigation of close contacts, including health care personnel who may have been exposed to patients infected with MERS-CoV was conducted. Close contacts were defined as any person who provided care for the patient, including a healthcare worker or family member, or had another similarly close physical contact, for example, someone with whom the patient had resided or visited [26] . Close contacts of confirmed or probable cases were identified and monitored for the appearance of respiratory symptoms for 14 days after their last exposure to the confirmed or suspected case, while the index case remained symptomatic. Any contact that became ill during that period of time was tested for MERS-CoV using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [27] to detect viral RNA from patient blood samples. RT-PCR was also used to test the camels, starting with RNA extracted from nasal and conjunctive swabs. The ethical approval was obtained based on Ministry of Health regulation.",

Several factors could have contributed to transmission in the current outbreak within the healthcare facilities, including delays in suspicion and case detection, delays in timely index case isolation and most importantly, lack of adherence to optimal infection control measures such as: using proper personal protective equipment (PPE) while providing care to the infected patients, proper hand hygiene and lack of proper isolation facilities like negative pressure rooms.",

The high fatality rates (31%) observed in our patients with these co-morbidities are in line with what has been reported globally (approximately 35%) [47] .

Awareness among this group should focus on avoiding close contact with camels or camel products, particularly in camel race festivals and breeding areas. Encouraging regular hand washing, especially following contact with camels [41] and early presentation to health care facilities when feeling unwell are also important messages. Practicing safe hygiene habits around dromedaries could reduce further transmission and prevent community clustered outbreaks.",

Close contacts include family members and health care worker contacts of the infected patients, including family member contacts that previously tested negative as per the WHO guideline [26] . c) It would have been advantageous to consider implementation of a study design using inferential methods, from which evidence-based conclusions can be drawn as the review limitation.",
