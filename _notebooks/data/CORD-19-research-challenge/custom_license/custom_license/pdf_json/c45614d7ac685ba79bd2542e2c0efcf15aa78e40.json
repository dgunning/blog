To date, only one adult case with mild symptoms of Covid-19 has been reported in Italian patients affected by Cystic Fibrosis (CF). No data are available in regard to incidence and outcomes within the pediatric CF population. Here we briefly report our first case of Covid-19 in an infant with CF.",

Field authorities hypothesize that this may be due to the high plasticity of their immune system, low expression of ACE2 receptors, or to the exposure of other coronaviruses which are generally common in kids [3, 4] . The Italian Cystic Fibrosis Research Foundation contacted all affiliated centers to obtain data on coinfection incidence in the CF population. They identified one adult and one child affected by Covid-19. While the adult presented mild symptoms, the toddler did not present any signs of the infection. This is the first report of Covid-19 in a child with CF. The patient presented with an asymptomatic infection, despite his underlying condition. Our experience is in accordance with the low incidence and good outcomes of SARS Cov 2 infection in children. However, collaborative studies will be required for complete understanding of SARS-Cov2 impact on patients with CF.",
