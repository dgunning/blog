Continuity of care with established patients as well as establishment of a professional relationship with new patients is challenging during this Public Health Emergency (PHE). Many geographic areas are under \"stay at home\" or \"shelter in place\" directives from state and local governments to avoid COVID-19 exposure risks. Medicare has recently allowed \"broad flexibilities to furnish services using remote communications technology to avoid exposure risks to health care providers, patients, and the community.\" 1 The implementation of telemedicine, or virtual, services, will help the Otolaryngologists provide needed care to patients while mitigating the clinical and financial impact of the pandemic. The significant coding and billing issues related to implementing telemedicine services are discussed to promote acceptance of this technology by the practicing Otolaryngologist. Of particular importance, outpatient visit Current Procedural Terminology\u00ae codes (99201-99215) may be used for telehealth visits performed in real-time audio and video.",

She had previously been treated with omeprazole and had done well and able to stop medication but had to restart recently due to the URI/cough. Her symptoms have persisted about a month and she has a foreign body sensation in her mid-throat. She restarted her omeprazole 20mg twice a day which seems to be helping. Pertinent review of systems is negative. Exam shows a well-developed, well-nourished and wellgroomed female appearing her stated age in no acute distress and without cough at this time. Diagnosis is probably recurrence of LPR. The patient will continue twice a day omeprazole for at least another 4 weeks. She will follow up if symptoms persist and we will proceed with direct laryngoscopy to further evaluate. She was advised to contact us immediately if her symptoms worsen. Additionally, she was advised to avoid alcohol, caffeine, not eat within 4 hours prior to bedtime and call the office if not improved. ",
