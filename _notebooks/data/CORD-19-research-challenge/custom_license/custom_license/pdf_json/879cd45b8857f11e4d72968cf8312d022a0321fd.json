To clarify the essential structure-activity relationship for the APN inhibitors as well as identify new potent leads against APN, pharmacophore models were established using structure-and common feature-based approaches and validated with a database of active and inactive compounds. These validated pharmacophores were then used in database screening for novel virtual leads. The hit compounds were further subjected to molecular docking studies to refine the retrieved hits. Finally, six structurally diverse compounds that showed strong interactions with the key amino acids and the zinc ion were selected for biological evaluation, where two hits showed more than 70% inhibition against APN at 60 \u03bcM concentration. The evaluation results show the potential of our screening approach in identifying APN inhibitors.",

In vivo, APN is involved in the metabolism of angiotensin III in the degradation of nociceptin, in the brain and peripheral organs and in the inactivation of enkephalins, in association with neutral endopeptidase NEP [6] [7] [8] . Moreover, this enzyme has been proved to behave as a receptor for coronaviruses TGEV and 229E in humans and pigs, and to be identical to a human lymphocyte surface cluster differentiation antigen CD13 [9] [10] [11] . APN has been also reported to play a vital role in the invasion of metastatic tumors in vitro [12, 13] . All these findings make APN an important target for therapeutic applications, which require the development of selective and potent inhibitors [14] .",

Chemical feature-based pharmacophores and virtual library screening may serve as a guide in the design of novel lead candidates.

A set of 7 structurally diverse aminopeptidase-N inhibitors were selected from literature [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] as the training set to establish the common feature-based pharmacophores. The 2D chemical structures of selected molecules were draw manually using ChemDraw (Cambridge-Soft, Cambridge, MA) and subsequently exported to DS. All compounds were minimized to the closest local minimum based on the Charmm-like force field (DS). The HipHop module available in DS was employed to establish the pharmacophore. For the calculation setup, two ligand properties have to be specified. The first property is the principal value that defines the activity level of the molecule. A principal value of 2 indicates all chemical features of a reference compound are considered in building the pharmacophore space during model generation. The second ligand property to define is the MaxOmitFeat value that specifies how many features are allowed to miss for each compound. A MaxOmitFeat value of 1 allows that all but one of the features in the generated pharmacophore must map the molecule. Compounds 1-2 were assigned a principal value of 2 and a MaxOmitFeat value of 0, respectively, while compounds 3-7 were given principal and MaxOmitFeat values of 1. On the basis of an analysis of the chemical features present in the training set structures, hydrogen bond donor, hydrogen bond acceptor, and hydrophobic features were selected for this study. A maximum number of 255 and an energy threshold of 10 kcal/mol above the energy minimum for conformation searching were set for each compound by using Best conformation generation option. Among the 10 possible hypotheses returned, the top ranked hypothesis (Pharmacophore-B) was selected and validated by the G\u00fcner-Henry (GH) scoring method.",

This pharmacophore model was basically composed of one hydrogen-bond acceptor (HBA) and two hydrogen-bond donor (HBD) features. The 3D space and distance constraints of these features are shown in Fig. 2A . To further include additional information on size and shape of the bestatin-binding pocket of APN, a shape constraint was added to the chemical features of the pharmacophore Hypo1. As displayed in Fig. 3 , the carbonyl group of bestatin that formed very important interactions with a zinc ion and Tyr477 in the binding site of APN overlaid the HBA feature of pharmacophore-A. In addition, the hydroxyl group of this molecule showing an ionic interaction with the zinc ion mapped one HBD feature, while the amino group that enabled considerable interactions with water molecules mapped the other HBD feature. The result indicated a fairly good mapping of bestatin on pharmacophore-A with the shape constraint. However, it is also implied that the pharmacophore-A may be utilized to only screen the compounds that have a chemical structure with functional groups closely related to those of bestatin. Thus a qualitative pharmacophore model (a common feature-based model or HipHop algorithm) was very necessary to identify structurally novel leads different from the bestatin. ",

The E value for pharmacophore-B was 13.57 as it has retrieved 57 active compounds among 66 screened molecules from the total of 1100 compounds. The higher is the E value, the greater is the ability of a pharmacophore in identifying the active compounds. This validation results showed that both pharmacophore models A and B were very efficient for database screening. When GH score is higher than 0.7, the model is very good.

In addition, it established hydrophobic interactions with Phe472, Phe896 and Ala351.

Both the pharmacophore models have provided the first insight into hypothetical ligand binding requirements for APN inhibitors. The validated results of in vitro enzymatic inhibitions on APN imply that pharmacophore-B composed of five features is better than pharmacophore-A in identifying potent APN inhibitors. The inhibition rates of the hits correlate with the fit values computed from the hypothesis and the docking scores. It is possible that searching of other commercial databases may result in the identification of other potentially more active APN inhibitors. We have shifted hits obtained from virtual screening to in vivo studies, the outcomes of which will be reported in the near future.",
