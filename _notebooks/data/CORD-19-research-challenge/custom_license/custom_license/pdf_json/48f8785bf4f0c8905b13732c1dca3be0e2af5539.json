Physiological 42 doses of corticosteroids are effective as a second-line 43 hormonal treatment for metastatic castrate-resistant pros-44tate cancer with prostate-specific antigen response rates to 45 0.5 mg of dexamethasone daily of over 40%[5]. Prednisolone46 at 5 mg twice daily is effective at preventing the hypermi-47 neralocorticoid dose-limiting toxicity of abiraterone, a life-48 prolonging CYP-17,20-lyase inhibitor. Notably, in a large 49 (n = 1209), randomised, double-blind study where patients 50 with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer re-51 ceived either abiraterone and prednisolone (give 5 mg twice 52 daily for a median duration of 25.8 mo) or double placebo, 53 there was no significant difference in the rate of infections 54 between the two arms [6]. Low-dose steroids are also useful 55 to treat cancer-associated constitutional symptoms such as 56 anorexia, fatigue, and nausea. 57 Supraphysiological doses of steroids are given as an 58 adjunct to decrease swelling (eg, preventing irreversible 59 nerve damage in malignant spinal cord compression), and 60 to prevent and treat cancer treatment toxicities such as 61 docetaxel-induced capillary leak syndrome and immune 62 checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) toxicities. CPIs, which lead to T-63 cell activation, have led to a step change in the management 64 of bladder and renal cancer, but are complicated by a 65 hyperinflammatory state requiring high-dose corticoste-66 roids in up to 30% of cases. High-dose steroids have a 67 number of recognised effects such as psychosis, diabetes, 68 avascular necrosis, osteoporosis, skin fragility, and immune 69 suppression.70An early report has suggested that cluster of differentia-71 tion (CD) 8+, CD4+, follicular helper T cells, and antibody 72 secreting B-cells may be responsible for successful 73 elimination of COVID-19[7].

However, a more 82 appropriate comparison is SARS-CoV-1, which is clinically 83 and genetically closest to SARS-CoV-2 and for which 84 corticosteroids were widely used during the 2003 SARS 85 pandemic. Stockman et al [10] performed a systematic review 86 of treatment effects in SARS patients. This included 29 sepa-87 rate studies reviewing corticosteroids comprising 21 retro-88 spective, five prospective, one case-control, and two 89 randomised control trials. The majority (25 studies) of studies 90 demonstrated no convincing evidence of either benefit or 91 detriment in clinical outcomes of patients with established 92SARS treated with corticosteroids[10]. The remaining studies 93 indicated an increase in known toxicities[10].There is currently no evidence that corticosteroid94 therapy in cancer patients increases the risk of infection 95 with COVID-19 or leads to worse clinical outcomes in 96 confirmed cases; however, supportive evidence is in its 97 infancy. The risk of viral infections at physiological steroid 98 doses would appear low for patients with progressive 99 prostate cancer, and we are prescribing low-dose dexa-100 methasone instead of palliative chemotherapy rationalis-101 ing that this will be less immunosuppressive than 102 chemotherapy and will hopefully control the disease until 103 after the worst of the pandemic. High-dose steroids carry a 104 theoretical susceptibility risk to COVID-19, but long-course 105 treatments are deployed only for life-threatening compli-106 cations where the need for treatment far outweighs a risk 107 of viral susceptibility. Immune checkpoint inhibition may 108 actually lead to improved antiviral immunity, and while we 109 recognise the potential risks of needing high-dose steroids 110 for toxicity, in bladder cancer we are prioritising first-line 111 immunotherapy over chemotherapy in programmed death 112 ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive patients. Hyperinflammation of 113 the lung is a fatal complication of COVID-19, and whether 114 corticosteroids are beneficial for this is the subject of on-115 going clinical trials.
