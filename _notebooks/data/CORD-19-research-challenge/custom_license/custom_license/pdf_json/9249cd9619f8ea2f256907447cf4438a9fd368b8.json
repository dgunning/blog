            "text": "During the past 100 years, pharmaceutical companies have made vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), pneumococcus, meningococcus, rotavirus, and human papillomavirus, among others (Table 82 .1). As a consequence, the number of children in the United States killed by pertussis decreased from 8000 each year in the early 20th century to fewer than 20; the number paralyzed by polio decreased from 15,000 to 0; the number killed by measles decreased from 3000 to 0; the number with severe birth defects caused by rubella decreased from 20,000 to 0; and the number with meningitis and bloodstream infections caused by Hib decreased from 25,000 to fewer than 100. Vaccines have been among the most powerful forces in determining how long we live. 1 However, the landscape of vaccines is also littered with tragedy. In the late 1800s, starting with Louis Pasteur, scientists made rabies vaccines using cells from nervous tissue, including animal brains and spinal cords. Although the vaccine prevented a uniformly fatal infection, it also caused seizures, paralysis, and coma in as many as 1 of every 230 people who used it. [2] [3] [4] [5] In 1942, the military injected hundreds of thousands of American servicemen with a yellow fever vaccine. To stabilize the vaccine virus, scientists added human serum. Unfortunately, some of the serum came from people unknowingly infected with hepatitis B virus. As a consequence, 330,000 soldiers were infected with hepatitis B, severe disease developed in 50,000, and 62 died. [6] [7] [8] [9] In 1955, five companies made Jonas Salk's new formaldehyde-inactivated polio vaccine. However, one company, Cutter Laboratories of Berkeley, California, failed to completely inactivate poliovirus with formaldehyde. Because of this failure, 120,000 children were injected with live poliovirus; 40,000, developed mild polio, 200 were permanently paralyzed, and 10 died. It was one of the worst biological disasters in American history. 10 Vaccines have also caused uncommon but severe adverse events not associated with production problems. For example, acute encephalopathy after whole-cell pertussis vaccine, 11, 12 Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) after swine flu vaccine, 13 paralytic polio following live attenuated oral polio vaccine, 14 anaphylaxis following several different vaccines, 15 severe or fatal viscerotropic disease following yellow fever vaccine, 16 and intussusception following rotavirus vaccine, [17] [18] [19] are problems associated with the use of vaccines, albeit rarely. As vaccine use increases and the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases decreases, vaccine-related adverse events become more prominent (Fig. 82.1 ). Even unfounded safety concerns can lead to decreased vaccine acceptance and resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases, as occurred in the 1970s and 1980s as a public reaction to allegations that the whole-cell pertussis vaccine caused encephalopathy ( Fig. 82.1 ). Recent outbreaks of measles, mumps, and pertussis in the United States are important reminders of how immunization delays and refusals can result in resurgences of vaccine-preventable diseases.

Tolerance of adverse reactions to pharmaceutical products (e.g., vaccines, contraceptives) given to healthy people-especially infants and toddlers-is substantially lower than to therapeutic agents (e.g., antibiotics, insulin) used to treat illness. 23 This translates into a need to investigate the possible causes of much rarer adverse events after vaccinations than would be acceptable for other pharmaceutical products. For example, severe side effects are essentially universal for cancer chemotherapy, and 10% to 30% of people receiving high-dose aspirin therapy experience gastrointestinal symptoms. 24 Safety monitoring is performed both before and after vaccine licensure, with slightly different goals based on the methodological strengths and weaknesses of each step.

            "text": "Vaccines, similar to other pharmaceutical products, undergo extensive safety and efficacy evaluations in the laboratory, in animals, and in phased human clinical trials before licensure. 30, 31 Phase I trials usually involved smaller numbers of subjects and are able to detect only extremely common adverse events. Phase II trials generally enroll several hundred people in each vaccine arm, as in the comparative infant diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine trials, 32 and provide data on the impact of antigen content, number of vaccine components, vaccine formulation, effect of successive doses, and profile of common reactions. These data can inform the choice of the candidate vaccines for Phase III trials. 33, 34 Sample sizes for Phase III vaccine trials are often based on efficacy considerations, and resultant safety data are dependent on the sample size (approximately 10 2 to 10 5 ) and the duration of observation (often <30 days). 33 Typically, only observations of rates of common local and systemic reactions (e.g., injection site swelling, fever, fussiness) are feasible. The experimental design of most clinical trials includes a control group (a placebo or an alternative vaccine) and the detection of adverse events by researchers who are \"blinded\" to which vaccine the patient received. This allows relatively straightforward inferences on the causal relationship between most adverse events and vaccination. 35 Several ways of enhancing prelicensure safety assessment of vaccines have been developed. One of these ways includes the Brighton Collaboration (www.brightoncollaboration.org), which was established to develop and implement globally accepted standard case definitions for assessing adverse events following immunizations. 36 Without such defined standards, it was often difficult, if not impossible, to compare and",

Both second-generation rotavirus vaccines (the bovine human reassortant vaccine, RotaTeq, and the attenuated human rotavirus vaccine, Rotarix) were subjected to Phase III trials that included at least 60,000 infants. 41, 42 While these trials were adequately powered to detect intussusception at the rate seen with RotaShield, they were not adequately powered to detect the rates ultimately seen with either RotaTeq or Rotarix.

            "text": "Because reactions that are rare, delayed, or which occur in only certain subpopulations may not be detected before vaccines are licensed, postlicensure evaluation of vaccine safety is critical. Historically, this evaluation has relied on passive surveillance and ad hoc epidemiologic studies, but, more recently, Phase IV trials and preestablished large, linked databases have enhanced the capabilities to study rare adverse events after specific immunizations. 35 Such systems may detect variation in rates of adverse events by manufacturer 44, 45 or specific lot. 46 More recently, clinical centers for the study of immunization safety have emerged as another useful infrastructure to advance our knowledge about safety. 47 In contrast with the methodological strengths of prelicensure randomized trials, however, postlicensure observational studies of vaccine safety pose a formidable set of methodological difficulties. 48 Confounding by contraindication is especially problematic for nonexperimental designs. Specifically, persons who do not receive vaccine (e.g., because of a medical contraindication) might have a different risk for an adverse event than vaccinated persons. Therefore, direct comparisons of vaccinated and unvaccinated children are often inherently confounded, and teasing out these confounding issues requires understanding of the complex interactions of multiple, poorly quantified factors. The Brighton case definitions for each adverse event are further arrayed by the level  of evidence provided (insufficient, low, intermediate, and  highest) ; therefore, they also can be used in settings with fewer resources (e.g., studies in less-developed settings or postlicensure surveillance). For example, in the large multisite Phase III infant DTaP trials, definitions of high fever across trials varied by temperature (39.5\u00b0C vs 40.5\u00b0C), measurement (oral vs rectal), and time (measured at 48 vs 72 hours). 37 This was unfortunate because standardized case definitions had been developed in these trials for efficacy but not for safety, even though the safety concerns provided the original impetus for the development of DTaP. 38, 39 There has been a greater recognition of the need for much larger safety databases before licensure. Because of pragmatic limits on the sample sizes of prelicensure studies, there are inherent limitations to the extent to which they can detect very rare, yet real, adverse events related to vaccination. Even if no adverse event has been observed in a trial of 10,000 vaccinees, one can only be reasonably certain that the real incidence of the adverse event is no higher than one in 3333 vaccinees. 40 vaccination, standardized definitions of vaccine-related adverse events are optimal. Implementation of similar standards across national boundaries has been advanced by the International Conference on Harmonization 74 and the Brighton Collaboration. 36 Because VAERS is the only surveillance system covering the entire U.S. population with data available on a relatively timely basis, it is the major means available to currently detect possible new, unusual, or extremely rare adverse events. For example, in 1999, passive reports to VAERS of intussusception among children vaccinated with RotaShield was the first postlicensure signal of a problem, 75 leading to epidemiologic studies that verified the association. 17, 76 Similarly, initial reports to VAERS of a previously unrecognized serious yellow fever vaccine-associated neurotropic disease 77 and viscerotropic disease 78, 79 have since been confirmed elsewhere. 80 Because of the success in detecting these signals, there have been various attempts to automate screening for signals using SRSs reports. New tools developed for pattern recognition in extremely large databases are beginning to be applied. 81 These include empirical Bayesian data mining to identify vaccineevent adverse event combinations that are reported more frequently following a specific vaccine than following all other vaccines combined. 82 Despite the aforementioned uses, SRSs for drug and vaccine safety have a number of major methodological weaknesses. Underreporting, biased reporting, and incomplete reporting are inherent to all such passive systems, and potential safety concerns might be missed. [83] [84] [85] Some increases in adverse events detected by VAERS might not be true increases, but instead might be the result of increases in reporting efficiency or vaccine coverage. For example, an increase in GBS reports was noted in VAERS shortly after the introduction of a new meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4) in 2005, but a larger study conducted in five U.S. health plans with more than 1.4 million MCV4 vaccinations found no increased risk of GBS. 86 As another example, pending litigation resulted in the filing of a large number of VAERS reports claiming that vaccines caused autism. 87, 88 Perhaps the most important methodological weakness of VAERS, however, is that it does not contain the information necessary for formal epidemiologic analyses. Such analyses require calculation of the rate of the adverse event after vaccination and a comparison rate among unvaccinated persons. The VAERS database provides data only for the number of persons who may have experienced an adverse event following immunization and, even then, only in a biased and underreported manner. VAERS lacks data on the denominator of total number of people vaccinated and the corresponding data on number of cases and denominator population of unvaccinated people. Sometimes reporting rates can be calculated by using VAERS case reports for the numerator and, if available, doses of vaccines administered (or, if unavailable, data on vaccine doses distributed or vaccine coverage survey data) for the denominator. These rates can then be compared with the background rate of the same adverse event in the absence of vaccination, if available. Because of underreporting, however, VAERS reporting rates will usually be lower than the actual rates of adverse events following immunization.",

[49] [50] [51] The national reporting of adverse events following immunizations can be done through the same reporting channels as those used for other adverse drug reactions, 51 as is the practice in France, 52 Japan, 53 New Zealand, 54 Sweden, 55 and the United Kingdom, 56 or with reporting forms or surveillance systems different from the drug safety monitoring systems, as is the practice in Australia, 57 Canada, 58, 59 Cuba, 60 Denmark, 61 India, 62 Italy, 63 Germany, 64 Mexico, 65 The Netherlands, 66 Brazil, 67 and the United States. 68 Vaccine manufacturers also maintain SRSs for their products and they forward reports to appropriate national regulatory authorities. 30, 65 In the United States, the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 mandated that healthcare providers report certain adverse events after immunizations. 69 The Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) was implemented jointly by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1990 to provide a unified national focus for collection of all reports of clinically significant adverse events, including, but not limited to, those mandated for reporting. 68 The VAERS form permits narrative descriptions of adverse events. Patients and their parents-not just healthcare professionals-are permitted to report to VAERS, and there is no restriction on the interval between vaccination and symptoms that can be reported. Report forms, assistance in completing the form, answers to other questions about VAERS, and additional information about the reported reactions, including whether or not the patient recovered, are available on the VAERS website (vaers.hhs.gov). Web-based reporting and simple data analyses are also available.",

In 1987, Canada developed the Vaccine Associated Adverse Event reporting system, 59, 70 which is supplemented by an active, pediatric hospital-based surveillance system that searches all admissions for possible relationships to immunizations (Immunization Monitoring Program-Active [IMPACT]). 71 Serious Vaccine Associated Adverse Event reports are reviewed by the Advisory Committee on Causality Assessment consisting of a panel of experts. 72 The Netherlands also convenes an annual panel to categorize reports, which are then published. 66 The United Kingdom and most members of the former Commonwealth use the yellow card system, whereby a reporting form is attached to officially issued prescription pads. 50, 55 Data on adverse drug events (including vaccine) from several countries are compiled by the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Center for International Drug Monitoring in Uppsala, Sweden. 73 With so many different passive surveillance systems that collect information on various medical events following range of medical care, underreporting and recall bias are reduced. With denominator data on doses administered and the ready availability of appropriate comparison (i.e., unvaccinated) groups, these large databases provide an economical and rapid means of conducting postlicensure studies of safety of drugs and vaccines. [112] [113] [114] [115] [116] The CDC initiated the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) project in 1990 113 to conduct postmarketing evaluations of vaccine safety and to establish an infrastructure allowing for high-quality research and surveillance. Several MCOs or integrated healthcare systems in the United States, comprising a population of more than 9 million members, participate in the VSD. Each site prepares computerized data files using a standardized data dictionary containing demographic and medical information on their members, such as age and sex, health plan enrollment, vaccinations, hospitalizations, outpatient clinic visits, emergency department visits, urgent care visits, and mortality data, as well as additional birth information (e.g., birth weight) when available. Other information sources, such as medical chart review; member surveys; and pharmacy, laboratory, and radiology data are often used in VSD studies to validate outcomes and vaccination data. There is rigorous attention to the maintenance of patient confidentiality, and each study undergoes institutional review board review.",

Although diverse, the population in the MCOs currently in the VSD project is not wholly representative of the United States in terms of geography or socioeconomic status. More important, because of the high coverage attained in the MCOs for most vaccines, few nonvaccinated control subjects are available. Therefore, VSD studies often rely on risk-interval analyses (e.g., to study the question of whether outcome \"x\" is more common in period \"y\" following vaccination compared with other periods) (Table 82. 2). 119 This approach, although powerful for evaluating acute adverse events, has limited ability to assess associations between vaccination and adverse events with delayed or insidious onset (e.g., autism). The VSD project also cannot easily assess mild adverse events (such as fever) that do not always come to medical attention. 113 Finally, because vaccines are not delivered in the context of randomized, controlled trials, the VSD project may not be able to successfully control for confounding and bias in each analysis, 120 and inferences on causality may be limited. 121 Despite these potential shortcomings, the VSD project provides an essential, powerful, and cost-effective complement to ongoing evaluations of vaccine safety in the United States. 115, 116 In view of the methodological and logistic advantages offered by large-linked databases, the United Kingdom and Canada also have developed systems linking immunization records with medical files. 71, 112 Certain countries, such as Sweden and Denmark, have the capability to conduct important Formal evaluation has been limited by the quality of diagnostic information on VAERS reports, especially whether a serious event reported to VAERS has been diagnosed accurately. Of 26 cases reported to VAERS in which GBS developed after influenza vaccination during the 1990-91 season, and for which hospital charts were reviewed by an independent panel of neurologists blinded to immunization status, the diagnosis of GBS was confirmed in only 22 (85%). 90 Intussusception was verified in 88% of VAERS reports filed after Rotashield vaccination. 75 Clinical reviews of VAERS reports submitted following 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine were able to verify 56% of possible GBS reports and 42% of reports of possible anaphylaxis. 91 Clinical review verification rates were similar for VAERS reports following human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination: 57% for GBS and 38% for anaphylaxis. 92 These studies highlight the often crude nature of signals generated by VAERS and the difficulty in ascertaining which potential vaccine safety concerns warrant further investigation. The problems with reporting efficiency and potentially biased reporting and the inherent lack of an adequate control group limit the certainty with which conclusions can be drawn. Recognition of these limitations in large part has helped stimulate the creation of more population-based methods of assessing vaccine safety.",

These studies usually have included cohorts in managed care organizations (MCOs) supplemented by diary or phone interviews. These methods were first used extensively after the licensure of polysaccharide and conjugated Hib vaccines. [93] [94] [95] Large postlicensure studies on safety and efficacy have also been conducted for several other vaccines, including those for DTaP, 38 varicella, and herpes zoster, 96, 97 as well as for less-frequently used vaccines, such as Japanese encephalitis vaccine. 98 Large Linked Databases, Including the Vaccine Safety Datalink. Historically, ad hoc epidemiologic studies have been used to assess signals of potential adverse events detected by SRSs, the medical literature, or other mechanisms. Some examples of such studies include the investigations of poliomyelitis after inactivated 10,99 and oral 100 polio vaccines, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) after diphtheria-tetanuspertussis (DTP) vaccination, 101-104 encephalopathy after DTP vaccination, 105,106 meningoencephalitis after mumps vaccination, 107 injection-site abscesses after vaccination, 108 and GBS after influenza vaccination. 13, 90, 109 The Institute of Medicine (IOM) has compiled and reviewed many of these studies. 11, 110, 111 Unfortunately, such ad hoc studies are often costly, timeconsuming, and limited to assessment of a single event or a few events or outcomes. Given these drawbacks and the methodological limitations of passive surveillance systems (such as described for VAERS), pharmacoepidemiologists turned to large databases linking computerized pharmacy prescriptions (and later immunization records) and medical outcome records. 85 These databases include defined populations such as members of MCOs, single-provider healthcare systems, and Medicaid programs.

Thus, it is important to have background rates available of expected adverse events to allow rapid evaluation of whether reported adverse events are occurring at a rate following immunization that is higher than would be expected by chance alone. The resources devoted to mass vaccination campaigns also provide opportunities to enhance existing immunization safety monitoring systems or to establish a system if none exists and these may lead to long-term improvements in immunization safety monitoring beyond the specific mass immunization campaign.",

            "text": "The response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic involved probably the largest and most intense immunization safety monitoring effort ever undertaken in the United States and internationally. The emergence of a novel influenza A (H1N1) virus prompted the development of 2009 influenza A (H1N1) monovalent vaccines. The FDA licensed the first 2009-H1N1vaccines in September 2009. With potentially hundreds of millions of people expected to be vaccinated, adverse events were anticipated to occur in some recently vaccinated people. To address the question of whether the vaccine could be causing the adverse events, background rates for several adverse events were developed. 137 To rapidly detect any unforeseen safety problems, the federal government implemented enhanced postlicensure 2009-H1N1 vaccine safety monitoring, 138 including in VAERS and VSD. A new collaboration was initiated that also performed rapid ongoing analyses similar to VSD and included the databases of several large health insurance plans, the Department of Defense, Medicare, and the Veterans Administration. In addition, active case vaccine safety assessments by linking data across national registries. [122] [123] [124] Clinical Centers, Including the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment Centers. More recently, the immunization safety infrastructure has been augmented by tertiary clinical centers, such as were first developed in certain regions in Italy 47 and Australia. 125, 126 In the United States, the CDC's Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) Project was established in 2001 to address unmet vaccine safety clinical research needs. CISA is a national network of vaccine safety experts from the CDC, seven medical research centers, and subject-matter experts. The CISA mission is to improve understanding of adverse events following immunization at the individual patient level. CISA serves as a vaccine safety resource providing expert consultation on clinical vaccine safety issues and with its partners conducts studies to identify risk factors and preventive strategies for vaccine adverse events, particularly in special populations. 28 The CISA investigators bring in-depth clinical, pathophysiological, and vaccinology expertise to assessing causal relationships between vaccines and adverse events, 127 and to understanding the pathogenesis of adverse events following vaccinations. The CISA investigators have published a standardized algorithm for evaluating and managing persons who have suspected or definite immediate hypersensitivity reactions such as urticaria, angioedema, and anaphylaxis following vaccines. 128 Some of the studies undertaken by CISA include an assessment of extensive limb swelling after DTaP, 129 a study of the usefulness of irritant skin test reactions for managing hypersensitivity to vaccines, 130 the clinical evaluation of patients with serious adverse events following yellow fever vaccine administration, 131 and evaluation of vaccine safety among children with inborn errors of metabolism. 132, 133 New understanding of the human genome, pharmacogenomics, and immunology hold promise for future CISA studies and may make it possible to elucidate some of the biological mechanisms of vaccine adverse reactions, which, in turn, could lead to the development of safer vaccines and safer vaccination practices, including revaccination when indicated. 134 include: (a) local reactions at a vaccine injection site; (b) immediate hypersensitivity reactions (in absence of other exposures); (c) recurrence-same adverse event recurs in same individual following repeat exposure to same vaccine; (d) isolation of vaccine virus (from typically sterile site), as, for example, Urabe mumps vaccine and aseptic meningitis; and (e) a unique clinical syndrome, such as vaccine-associated paralytic polio. More general causality assessments rely on weighing different pieces of evidence using criteria such as strength of association, consistency of findings, temporal relationships, potential biases, and possible biological mechanisms. In the United States, the most authoritative assessments of causality have been conducted by the IOM, whose findings have been particularly influential in compiling the vaccine injury table of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The IOM has conducted three comprehensive reviews of adverse effects of vaccines, 111, 142, 143 as well as several focused reviews of specific vaccine safety topics. As highlighted in Table 82 .3, the adverse reactions for which there is strong evidence of a causal association with recommended childhood vaccines in the United States are few and tend to occur rarely. Newer vaccines and certain other vaccines, however, were not covered in the latest IOM review in 2012. This gap was addressed by a systematic review of the literature commissioned by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. 144 That review identified a few additional adverse events where the evidence favors a causal association, including rotavirus vaccines and intussusception, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and febrile seizure, hepatitis A vaccine and purpura, and varicella vaccine and thrombocytopenic purpura.",

            "text": "A central function of vaccine safety monitoring and assessment activities is to determine if particular adverse events following immunization are caused by a vaccine. This determination is important in guiding immunization policy and individual care and possibly compensation decisions. Causality assessment may be performed at the individual or population level. Epidemiologic studies provide measures of risk on a population level, but they do not provide evidence that a particular vaccine caused an adverse event in a particular individual. It is often not possible to infer causality in individual cases of adverse events following immunization, except in certain special situations. Circumstances in which a causal association in individual cases can reasonably be inferred position. 160 This downward trend in SIDS has also been observed in SIDS reports submitted to VAERS. 161 Considerable evidence supports the notion that vaccination is not causally associated with SIDS, [162] [163] [164] [165] including an IOM review in 2003 that rejected a causal association between the whole cell pertussis-containing vaccine and SIDS and between exposure to multiple simultaneous vaccines and SIDS. 145 More recently, the misconception of mistakenly attributing temporally related events as causal was highlighted in the U.S. multistate measles outbreak of 2014-15. Early on, unsubstantiated claims of deaths caused by the MMR vaccine appeared on the Internet. [166] [167] [168] These claims were largely based on publicly available VAERS data. VAERS, however, is a voluntary reporting system that accepts any submitted report of an adverse event without judging whether it was caused by a vaccination. Any claims of cause and effect with respect to deaths following vaccination based on VAERS reports should be interpreted with caution. When the complete VAERS reports and accompanying medical records, autopsy reports, and death certificates were reviewed by FDA and CDC physicians, no concerning patterns were detected to suggest a causal relationship with MMR vaccination. 169, 170 With rare exceptions (e.g., anaphylaxis), the evidence does not suggest a causal relationship between vaccination and death. In addition to the 2003 review of SIDS, a previous IOM review of death reports in VAERS concluded that the vast majority of reported deaths were coincidental and not causally related to vaccination. 171 A newer VSD study of more than 13 million vaccinated persons compared rates and causes of death in the vaccinated study population to the general U.S. population. The death rate 1 or 2 months following vaccination was lower than that in the general U.S. population and the causes of death were similar, 172 providing persuasive evidence that vaccinations are not associated with an increased risk of death.",

For example, when a combination pentavalent vaccine replacing the diphtheria-tetanuswhole-cell pertussis (DTwP) vaccine or DTwP-hepatitis B vaccine was introduced into Sri Lanka, India, and Vietnam in 2008-10, deaths were reported among a small number of vaccine recipients prompting authorities to suspend the use of these vaccines. 157 In 2010, an HPV demonstration project in India was suspended in response to demands from advocacy groups when four deaths occurred following receipt of HPV vaccine. 158 In December 2013, the deaths of 17 infants following hepatitis B virus vaccine made by a manufacturer in China generated widespread media and public interest, leading to a temporary suspension of the vaccine. 159 Investigations in all these examples found that the deaths were not caused by the vaccines.",

In the mid-1980s, the antivaccine group Dissatisfied Parents Together raised the notion that the whole-cell pertussis vaccine could cause SIDS. In the early 1990s, when the hepatitis B vaccine was recommended for routine use in newborns, a popular television news program raised the question of whether vaccines could cause SIDS. SIDS peaks between 2 and 3 months of age, a time when infants are receiving a relatively large number of recommended vaccinations; thus, it would not be unexpected to observe a coincidental close temporal relationship between vaccination and SIDS. SIDS deaths in the United States have been declining since the early 1990s for a variety of reasons, including recommended changes in sleeping is probably a conservative estimate for several factors, including consideration of only vaccine-specific B-cell responses and ignoring the dynamic nature of the immune system. For example, a study of T-cell population dynamics in HIV-infected persons found that adults have the capacity to generate approximately 2 \u00d7 10 9 new T lymphocytes each day. 187 Although the quantity of new B and T cells generated each day in healthy people is unknown, studies of HIV-infected persons demonstrate the enormous capacity of the immune system to generate lymphocytes when needed.",

For example, infection with wild-type measles virus causes a reduction in the number of circulating B and T cells during the viremic phase of infection and a delay in the development of cell-mediated immunity. 188, 189 Similarly, wild-type measles virus infection can cause long-term loss of memory B and T cells, resulting in an increased mortality from other infections. 190 Downregulation of cell-mediated immunity by wild-type measles virus probably results from downregulation of the production of Although some vaccines are given in combination, infants and young children could receive more than 20 shots and three oral doses of vaccines by 2 years of age, including as many as five shots at one time. [178] [179] [180] [181] A prevalent concern is that little is known about the safety of the recommended immunization schedule as a whole. Parents have expressed the opinion, for example, that too many vaccines are given to children at too young an age and that early childhood immunization overwhelms the immune system. These sentiments reflect concern about the number, frequency, and timing of recommended vaccines rather than about the specific properties of particular vaccines. 178, [182] [183] [184] In response to this public concern, the IOM, in 2012, convened a committee to examine stakeholder concerns and scientific evidence regarding the safety of the recommended childhood immunization schedule, and to identify study settings, designs, and methods that would be appropriate to rigorously address this issue. 185 The IOM committee concluded that, although few published investigations had specifically examined the safety of the recommended childhood schedule as a whole, the accumulation of available evidence indicated that the current U.S. immunization schedule is safe. That evidence was based in part on concomitant use studies required by the FDA prior to licensure of a vaccine. Concomitant use studies determine whether new vaccines alter either the safety or immunogenicity profile of existing vaccines that will be given at the same time as the new vaccine and whether existing vaccines alter the safety or immunogenicity profiles of the new vaccine.",

This have been advanced to explain how vaccines could account for all the prerequisites that would be required for the development of autoimmune disease. At least four key conditions must be met for development of autoimmune disease. First, self-antigen-specific T cells or self-antigen-specific B cells must be present. Second, selfantigens must be presented in sufficient amounts to trigger autoreactive cells. Third, costimulatory signals, cytokines, and other activation signals produced by antigen-presenting cells (such as dendritic cells) must be present during activation of self-reactive T cells. Fourth, peripheral tolerance mechanisms must fail to control destructive autoimmune responses. If all these conditions are not met, the activation of self-reactive lymphocytes and progression to autoimmune disease are not likely.",

            "text": "Mechanisms are present at birth to prevent the development of immune responses directed against self-antigens (autoimmunity). T-and B-cell receptors of the fetus and newborn develop with a random repertoire of specificities. In the thymus, T cells that bind strongly to self-peptide-major histocompatibility complexes die, while those that bind with a lesser affinity survive to populate the body. This central selection process eliminates strongly self-reactive T cells, while selecting for T cells that recognize antigens in the context of self-major histocompatibility complex. In the fetal liver, and later in the bone marrow, B-cell receptors (i.e., immunoglobulins) that bind self-antigens strongly are also eliminated. Therefore, the thymus and bone marrow, by expressing antigens from many tissues of the body, enable the removal of the majority of potentially dangerous autoreactive T and B cells before they mature-a process termed central tolerance. 207 It is not simply the presence of autoreactive T and B cells, however, that result in autoimmune disease. Autoreactive T and B cells are present in all people because it is not possible for every antigen from every tissue of the body to participate in the elimination of all potentially autoreactive cells. A process termed peripheral tolerance further limits the activation of autoreactive cells. 208, 209 Mechanisms of peripheral tolerance include: (a) antigen sequestration (antigens of the central nervous system, eyes, and testes are not regularly exposed to the immune system unless injury or infection occurs); (b) anergy (lymphocytes partially triggered by antigen but without costimulatory signals are unable to respond to subsequent antigen exposure); (c) activation-induced cell death (a selflimiting mechanism involved in terminating immune responses after antigen is cleared); and (d) inhibition of immune responses by specific regulatory cells. [210] [211] [212] [213] Thus, the immune system anticipates that self-reactive T cells will be present and has mechanisms to control them. Any theory of vaccine causation of autoimmune diseases must take into account how these controls are circumvented. As discussed subsequently, epidemiologic studies have not supported the hypothesis that vaccines cause autoimmune diseases. This is consistent with the fact that no mechanisms inactivated influenza vaccination seems to be associated with a decreased risk for asthma exacerbations throughout influenza seasons. 248 Several more recent studies have also shown a lack of correlation between receipt of vaccines and the development of asthma.

            "text": "Probably one of the most contentious issues in recent years has been speculation that vaccines cause autism. Autism is a chronic developmental disorder characterized by problems in social interaction, communication, and responsiveness and by repetitive interests and activities. Although the causes of autism are largely unknown, family and twin studies suggest that genetics has a fundamental role. 253 In addition, overexpression of neuropeptides and neurotrophins has been found in the immediate perinatal period among children later diagnosed with autism, suggesting that prenatal or perinatal influences or both have a more important role than postnatal insults. 254 However, because autistic symptoms generally first become apparent in the second year of life, some scientists and parents have focused on the role of MMR vaccine because it is first administered around this time. Concern about the role of MMR vaccine was heightened in 1998 when the Lancet published a study based on 12 children that proposed an association between the vaccine and the development of ileonodular lymphoid hyperplasia, nonspecific colitis, and regressive developmental disorders (later termed by some as \"autistic enterocolitis\"). 255 Among the proposed mechanisms was that MMR vaccine present in the intestinal tissues caused bowel problems, leading to the malabsorption of essential vitamins and other nutrients and eventually to autism or other developmental disorders. Concern about this issue led to a decline in measles vaccine coverage in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. 256 Significant concerns about the validity of the study included the lack of an adequate control or comparison group, inconsistent timing to support causality (several of the children had autistic symptoms preceding bowel symptoms), and the lack of an accepted definition of the syndrome. 257 Subsequently, population-based studies of autistic children in the United Kingdom found no association between receipt of MMR vaccine and autism onset or developmental regression. 258, 259 Soon after publication of the Lancet article that ignited the controversy, 255 two ecologic analyses found no evidence that MMR vaccination was the cause of apparent increased trends in autism over time 260, 261 ; in addition, two other studies found no evidence of a new variant form of autism associated with bowel disorders secondary to vaccination. 262, 263 Several newer studies also refuted the notion that MMR vaccine caused autism. [264] [265] [266] [267] [268] [269] Perhaps the most powerful study involved younger siblings where the older child had autism; in this study, receipt of MMR vaccine did not increase the risk of autism in the younger child. 270 Because of the level of concern surrounding this issue, the CDC and the National Institutes of Health requested an independent review by the IOM. 271 The Immunization Safety Review Committee appointed by the IOM to review this issue was unable to find evidence supporting a causal relationship at the population level between autistic spectrum disorders and MMR vaccination, nor did the committee find any evidence of biological mechanisms that would support or explain such a link. In February 2010, the Lancet retracted the 1998 article. 272 The mercury-containing preservative, thimerosal, has also been suggested to possibly increase the risk of autism. Mercury is a naturally occurring element found in the earth's crust, air, soil, and water. Certain types of bacteria in the environment could prolong the length or increase the frequency of Th2-type responses. 230, 231 Although all factors that cause changes in the balance of Th1 and Th2 responses are not fully known, 232 it is clear that dendritic cells have a critical role. For example, adjuvants (e.g., aluminum hydroxide or aluminum phosphate [\"alum\"] contained in some vaccines) promote dendritic cells to stimulate Th2-type responses. 233, 234 Adjuvants could cause allergies or asthma by stimulating bystander, allergen-specific Th2 cells. However, vaccine surveillance data show no evidence for environmental allergen priming by vaccination. 235 Furthermore, local inoculation of adjuvant does not cause a global shift of immune responses to Th1 or Th2 type. 236, 237 The other hypothesis advanced to explain how vaccines could promote allergies is that by preventing several childhood infections (the hygiene hypothesis), stimuli that evolution has relied on to cause a shift from the neonatal Th2-type immune response to the balanced Th1-Th2 response patterns of adults have been eliminated. 230, 231 However, the diseases that are prevented by vaccines constitute only a small fraction of the total number of illnesses to which a child is exposed, and it is unlikely that the immune system would rely on only a few infections for the development of a normal balance between Th1 and Th2 responses. For example, a study of 25,000 illnesses performed in Cleveland, Ohio, in the 1960s found that children experienced six to eight infections per year in the first 6 years of life; most of these infections were caused by viruses such as coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and myxoviruses-diseases for which children are not routinely immunized. 238 Also at variance with the hygiene hypothesis is the fact that children in developing countries have lower rates of allergies and asthma than children in developed countries even though they are commonly infected with helminths and worms-organisms that induce strong Th2-type responses. 239 ",

A large clinical trial performed in Sweden found no increased risk, 241 and a very large longitudinal study in the United Kingdom found no association between pertussis vaccination and early-or late-onset wheezing or recurrent or intermittent wheezing. 242 Two studies from the VSD project have also lent data to this controversy. In one study of 1366 infants with wheezing during infancy, vaccination with DTP and other vaccines was not related to the risk of wheezing in full-term infants. 243 In another study of more than 165,000 children, childhood vaccinations were not associated with an increased risk for developing asthma. 244 Finally, a study from Finland also suggested that children with a history of natural measles were at increased risk for atopic illness. Such findings run contrary to the hypothesis that the increase in atopic illnesses seen in several countries is a consequence of the reduction in wild measles resulting from immunizations. 245 A separate concern is whether inactivated influenza vaccination may exacerbate asthma in children with preexisting asthma. Results of studies examining the potential associations between administration of inactivated influenza vaccine and various surrogate measures of asthma exacerbation, including decreased peak expiratory flow rate, increased use of bronchodilating drugs, and increase in asthma symptoms, have yielded mixed results. Most studies, however, have not supported such an association. 246 In fact, after controlling for asthma severity, acute asthma exacerbations were less common after inactivated influenza vaccination than before, 247 and sis found no association between the number of antigens in vaccines and neurodevelopmental outcomes. 289",

            "text": "Several pieces of biological 275 and epidemiologic evidence indicate that thimerosal does not cause autism. Importantly, several large epidemiologic studies have compared the risk of autism in children who received vaccines containing thimerosal with children who received vaccines without thimerosal or vaccines with lesser quantities of thimerosal; none of the studies found an increased risk of autism associated with thimerosal-containing vaccines. [276] [277] [278] [279] [280] [281] The IOM has reviewed these studies and concluded that evidence favored rejection of a causal association between thimerosal in vaccines and autism. 111, 282 Denmark, a country that abandoned thimerosal as a preservative in 1991, actually saw an increase in the disorder beginning several years later. In the United States, all childhood vaccines with thimerosal as a preservative (except multidose influenza vaccine) passed their expiration date by 2003 and were no longer available in the United States; nonetheless, autism prevalence increased in the subsequent years. 283 The hypothesis for why vaccines might cause autism has continued to shift. In 1998, the concern was that the MMR vaccine caused autism. The following year, the concern shifted to include the fear that thimerosal in vaccines caused autism. As data continued to be generated showing that both of these concerns were ill founded, the hypothesis shifted again-this time to include the fear that too many vaccines given too soon caused autism. To address this concern, a CDC study published in 2013 compared the number of antigens from vaccines during the first 2 years of life in a group of children with autism and matched controls without autism. The results showed that the total amount of antigen from vaccines received was the same between children with autism and those who did not have autism. 284 Related to concerns about autism, the possibility that vaccines could cause other developmental disabilities, such as speech problems or learning difficulties, has also been evaluated. Several studies have evaluated a possible association between exposure to thimerosal in vaccines and neurodevelopmental problems and have found no consistent increased risk. [285] [286] [287] The total number of vaccines and vaccine antigens has also not been found to have a relationship with neurodevelopmental problems. Smith and Woods compared children who had received vaccines according to the CDC/American Academy of Pediatrics schedule with children who were not vaccinated, only partially vaccinated, or received vaccines on a delayed schedule, noting no difference between the two groups in neurodevelopmental outcomes. 288 A separate analy-announced that they had received reports of narcolepsy after vaccination with Pandemrix. 320, 321 Narcolepsy is a chronic central nervous system disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness. 322 Its incidence is highest during the teen years, 323 but many individuals with narcolepsy are not diagnosed until several years after the onset of symptoms. 324 An increased risk of narcolepsy in Pandemrix-vaccinated compared with unvaccinated children and adolescents was found in Finland, 325 Sweden, 326 Ireland, 327 and Norway, 328 as well as in England 329 and France. 330 A case-control study that pooled data from eight European countries found an overall increased risk, although not in all countries. 331 Some European countries also reported an increased risk after vaccination in adults up to age 40 years, although the risk was smaller than the risk among vaccinees younger than 20 years of age. 326, 330 A casecontrol study from Quebec of the Canadian AS03-adjuvanted vaccine, Arepanrix, found a small increased risk of narcolepsy, mainly in individuals younger than 20 years old, but a possible confounding effect of influenza infection could not be ruled out. 332 No increased risk of narcolepsy was found in a VSD study of the nonadjuvanted 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccines that were used in the United States. 333 Although no signals have been identified in SRSs, 334 risk of narcolepsy associated with MF59 adjuvanted vaccines has not been evaluated in formal epidemiologic studies. Questions remain about possible biological mechanisms and whether the association between Pandemrix and narcolepsy is confounded by other potential exposures or systematic biases, including publicity around the identified association. 331, 335 Newer studies suggest that the issue may be more related to the influenza vaccine and not the adjuvant. 336 This is more fully discussed in Chapter 68.",

Although the majority of parents support immunizations, surveys have found that many parents have concerns or misconceptions 180-182 that could erode their confidence in vaccines. 178 Within this context, the art of addressing vaccine safety concerns through effective risk communication has emerged as an increasingly important skill for managers of mature immunization programs and healthcare providers who administer vaccines. number of national immunization programs have experienced loss of confidence in their HPV vaccination programs as a result of negative publicity from perceived safety issues. 305 The postulated safety problems have included cerebral vasculitis, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, and autoimmune diseases. [305] [306] [307] The suggestion that HPV vaccine could cause fatal cerebral vasculitis was raised in case reports that hypothesized that inflammation could be related to HPV L1 gene DNA fragments in the vaccine. 308, 309 The FDA, however, determined that small amounts of HPV DNA fragments are to be expected as a result of the vaccine manufacturing process and do not represent a safety concern. 310 Moreover, the autopsy findings in the reported cases did not reveal evidence of inflammation and thus do not support a diagnosis of cerebral vasculitis. Concerns about CRPS have been limited to a few case reports in Japan that received considerable media attention. 311 Similar cases have not been reported from other countries. An expert review committee in Japan determined that information was not adequate to make a definitive diagnosis of CRPS in many of the reported cases and a causal relationship to vaccination could not be established. 312 A review by the European Medicines Agency concluded that the evidence does not support a causal association between HPV vaccines and CRPS or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. 313 Safety monitoring in the United States and internationally support the safety of HPV vaccine. In the United States, a review of VAERS found that reports of syncope and venous thromboembolism (VTE) were higher following HPV4 when compared to other vaccines. Continued monitoring in VAERS has not identified any new or unexpected safety concerns. 314 A population-based study of HPV4 safety from the VSD found no statistically significant increased risks of GBS, stroke, VTE, appendicitis, seizures, syncope, allergic reactions, or anaphylaxis. 315 A manufacturer-sponsored postlicensure safety assessment of HPV4 did not identify any major safety concerns except for an elevated relative risk of Hashimoto thyroiditis; however, further investigation of the temporal relationship and biological plausibility by the safety review committee revealed no consistent evidence for a safety signal for autoimmune thyroid conditions. 316 A national registry linkage study from Denmark found that HPV4 did not increase the risk of VTE. 317 A large population-based cohort study conducted in Denmark and Sweden analyzed more than 696,000 doses of HPV4 among females 318 and found no consistent evidence supporting causal associations with several autoimmune and neurologic conditions or VTE. A case-control study in France found no increased risk of several autoimmune outcomes (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, central demyelination, GBS, connective tissue disorders, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and autoimmune thyroiditis) following HPV vaccination. 319 An analysis of national data from Sweden and Denmark covering 4 million women, including nearly 800,000 who had received HPV4, found no increased risk of multiple sclerosis or other demyelinating diseases following HPV4 vaccination. 124 Arguably, the HPV vaccine has been subjected to greater scrutiny postlicensure than most other vaccines.",

Moreover, these factors are referred to as \"outrage\" factors in the risk communication literature. Outrage can lead to a person responding emotionally and can increase further the level of perceived risk. 346 People care not only about the magnitude of risks, but also how risks are managed and whether they participate in the risk-management process. 347 In medical decision making, this has resulted in a transition from more paternalistic models to increasing degrees of shared decision making. 348 Some have argued that a similar transition also should occur with immunizations. 349 One study, 350 however, found that physicians who introduced vaccines using a participatory approach were more likely to encounter resistance compared to those who introduced vaccines as a presumptive or default choice. Furthermore, immunization is unlike most other medical procedures in that the consequences of the decision affect not only the individual person, but also others in society. Because of this important distinction, many countries have enacted immunization laws that, in part, are meant to limit an individual person's right to infect others. Without such mandates, persons may attempt to avoid the risks of vaccination while being protected by the herd immunity resulting from others being vaccinated. 351 Unfortunately, the protection provided by herd immunity may disappear if too many people avoid vaccination, resulting in outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. 352, 353 Debates in the United States, where such laws are created and enforced at the state level, have focused on whether philosophical (in addition to medical and religious) exemptions to mandatory immunizations for school entry should be more or less restrictive, and what standards for claim of exemption are needed. 349, 354, 355 For example, in 2015, California removed all nonmedical exemptions to school-entry vaccination requirements beginning in the 2016-17 school year. 356 Thus, vaccine risk communications should not only describe the risks and benefits of vaccines for individuals, but also should include discussion of the impact of individual immunization decisions on the larger community.",

Although each evaluation of a vaccine safety concern is in some ways unique, some general principles may apply to most cases. As with all investigations, the first step is objective and comprehensive data gathering. 43 It is also important to gather and weigh evidence for causes other than vaccination. For individual cases or clusters of cases, a field investigation to gather data firsthand may be necessary. 108, 379 Advice and review from a panel of independent experts also may be needed. 90, 380, 381 Causality assessment at the individual level is difficult at best; further evaluation via epidemiologic or laboratory studies may be required. 382 Even if the investigation is inconclusive, such studies can often help maintain public trust in immunization programs. 383 In the United States, written information about the risks and benefits of immunizations developed by the CDC has been required to be provided to all people vaccinated in the public sector since 1978. 384 The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act requires every healthcare provider-public or private-who administers a vaccine that is covered by the Act to provide a copy of the most current VIS to the adult vaccinee or, in the case of a minor, to the parent or legal representative, each time a dose of vaccine is administered. 385 Healthcare providers must note in each patient's permanent medical record the date printed on the VIS and the date the VIS was given to the vaccine recipient or the recipient's legal representative. VISs are the cornerstone of provider-patient vaccine risk-benefit communication. Each VIS contains information on the disease(s) that the vaccine prevents, who should receive the vaccine and when, contraindications, vaccine risks, what to do if a side effect occurs, and where to go for more information. Current VISs can be obtained from the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases 386 and are available in a number of languages other than English from the Immunization Action Coalition (www.immunize.org). An increasing number of resources that address vaccine safety misconceptions and allegations also have become available, including websites, brochures, resource kits, and videos (Table  82 .5). Some studies have been conducted to assess the use and effectiveness of such materials 364, 365, [387] [388] [389] ; however, more research in this area is needed.",

It may be that parents who were already concerned about vaccines before their child began the vaccination schedule sought medical attention for minor side effects (e.g., fever) or nonrelated problems. It is also possible that an apparent adverse event following immunization that resulted in parents seeking medical attention for their child caused the parents' perception of vaccines to become more negative. Both possibilities may result in parents declining future vaccines for their children. It is also important to note, however, that a physician's personal experience, with both vaccinations and vaccine-preventable diseases, can also be influential in helping reluctant parents understand the importance of on-time vaccination. 375 Education and descriptions of vaccine-preventable diseases may also help parents balance the perceived risks of vaccines with the risks of vaccinepreventable diseases. 376 ",

For healthcare providers to be able to optimally fill this important role, however, two related issues need to be addressed. The first is the need for quality communication courses and training in medical schools and residencies and training programs for medical and public health professionals regarding vaccine safety.

Prelicensure activities form the foundation of vaccine safety. Rapid advances in biotechnology are leading to the development of new vaccines, 403 and novel delivery technologies, such as DNA vaccines and new adjuvants, are being developed to permit more antigens to be combined, reducing the number of injections. 404, 405 In the prelicensure evaluation of new vaccines, the trend is likely to continue to conduct larger Phase III trials enrolling tens of thousands of participants. Although such larger trials are helpful in identifying more rare adverse events, even these larger trials may not be large enough to detect increased risks of rare events. For example, the RotaTeq and Rotarix preclinical trials identified no increased risk of intussusception in studies that enrolled more than 60,000 infants. 41, 42 Subsequent much larger postlicensure safety monitoring studies, however, identified statistically significant increased risks on the order of approximately one to five per 100,000. 18, 19, 406, 407 and that they (or their children) are vulnerable to a vaccinepreventable disease and its possible consequences.",

Safety monitoring will also be important when anticipated new vaccines, such as group B streptococcus, respiratory syncytial virus vaccines, 419, 420 and possibly meningococcal vaccines are introduced for use in pregnancy. Scientific data are essential in the monitoring and evaluation of vaccine safety, but scientific evidence alone often is not sufficient to provide reassurance about the safety of a vaccine. Although immunization levels of U.S. children are high, a sizable fraction of parents do not have their children fully immunized, and concern about vaccine safety is the leading reason for underimmunization. These concerns persist despite the scientific evidence that vaccines do not cause autism or a host of other conditions that have been alleged to be caused by vaccines, such as asthma, diabetes, and autoimmune diseases. Thus, it is critically important that public health agencies, medical organizations, and other influential authorities continue to focus on the safety of vaccines and assure public confidence by providing clear, consistent messages on vaccine safety concerns; supporting effective and transparent vaccine safety monitoring systems and research activities; providing review and recommendations by respected independent expert groups on vaccine safety controversies; and engaging advocacy groups in constructive and open dialogue about their vaccine safety concerns. Although the efforts of government, medical, and other authorities are important, it is healthcare providers who have the greatest influence in determining the acceptance of vaccines by individual people. Even among parents who believe that vaccines may not be safe, most will have their children vaccinated if they have a trusting relationship with an influential healthcare provider. Thus, development of tools and strategies that can assist healthcare providers in effectively communicating with their patients on the risks and benefits of vaccines will continue to be important.",

The possibilities for conducting enhanced safety monitoring, particularly with the large-scale introduction of new vaccines, was demonstrated with meningococcal A conjugate vaccine in sub-Saharan Africa. 425 Continued development of LMIC vaccine safety monitoring infrastructures will be needed with the introduction of new vaccine products, such as an adjuvanted malaria vaccine, 426 and viral vector dengue 427 and Ebola virus vaccines. 428 Mass immunization campaigns, during which millions of people receive parenteral immunizations over a period of days, 429 pose substantial challenges to ensuring injection safety, 430 especially given concerns about inadequate The attributable risks were less than that found for RotaShield (approximately one per 10,000), and, because the benefits of rotavirus vaccines clearly outweighed the small risk of intussusception, no changes were made to the vaccine recommendations.",

The existence of a robust vaccine safety monitoring system is essential for providing assurance of the safety of currently marketed vaccines and for rapidly identifying and responding to potential safety problems. Currently, SRSs, such as VAERS, serve as the frontline systems for the early identification of vaccine safety problems. Such systems could be improved if reporting were more complete. Application of web-based and text messaging technologies could make reporting easier and more accurate and also enable more active follow-up of vaccinated persons. 410 Alerts built into electronic medical record systems 411 could also improve reporting to VAERS, as could linkages with immunization registries. Some of these advances will be particularly important to enable monitoring vaccine safety in mass vaccination campaigns during which vaccinations may be administered primarily outside of the traditional healthcare system.",

The diffusion of electronic health records and the capability to link records across data systems (such as large health insurance claims databases and immunization registries) may allow the expansion of the population that could be included in postlicensure epidemiologic evaluations of vaccine safety. For example, the FDA Sentinel Initiative has a goal to develop a national electronic system covering 100 million people for monitoring the postlicensure safety of drugs and other medical products, including vaccines. 412 For adverse reactions that are established as caused by vaccines, clinical and laboratory research is essential for determining the biological mechanisms of the adverse reaction, which, in turn, could lead to the development of safer vaccines. Clinical research is also essential for the development of protocols for safer vaccination, including revaccination of persons who have previously experienced an adverse reaction.
