She was administered biapenem, linezolid and oseltamivir, and 48 oxygen therapy. The next day, her oxygen saturation suddenly dropped to 60%, and she 49 was urgently intubated and supported by ventilator. Finally, her condition deteriorated 50 so quickly that she died on January 31. 51A 55-year-old woman with GGOs in right lower lobe (Figure B1) was suspected of 53 early lung cancer and underwent right lower lobectomy on January 17. She had no any 54 morbidity and her pulmonary function testing was normal prior to surgery. Pathologic 55 diagnosis was a pulmonary meningothelial-like nodule and atypical adenomatoid 56 hyperplasia.

On 57 January 20, she complained of serious cough and fever with temperature of 38.9 , and 58 her CT showed bilateral pneumonia (Figure B2). On January 22, RT-PCR for 59 SARS-CoV-2 was positive.

Five days after operation, the patient 70 presented cough and chest distress, and chest CT images displayed multiple, subpleural, 71 and then was re-admitted and diagnosed as COVID-19 infection by RT-PCR for 74 SARS-CoV-2 test.

No patients with wedge 85 resection, segmentectomy and limited section contracted COVID-19 at this time. We 86 had suspended lung surgeries since January 20 due to outbreak of COVID-19 and 87 Chinese New Year. Mortality of patients with no COVID-19 was less than 1% and 88 perioperative mortality of patients with COVID-19 was 66.7%. We only tested patients 89 with typical symptomatic COVID-19 infection due to limited test kits. In addition, we 90 did not fully understand this disease at this time. We obtained oral informed consent 6 from patients and their family and the case study was approved by the institutional 92 ethics board of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (2020032). The three cases 93 reported here had no symptoms of pneumonia before surgeries. Case one and case three 94 were in the same room after surgeries and may have been infected with COVID-19 by 95 each other. They presented SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia related symptoms, such as 96 aggravated dyspnea, severe cough and fever, from three days to six days after their 97 surgeries. These patients might have been in the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 98 infection when they had their lung lobectomies. They most likely contract COVID-19 99 after surgery. It was too difficult to confirm the exact date of the SARS-CoV-2 100 infection for these cases. Fortunately, no health care workers on this floor contract 101 COVID-19 except for one nurse. 102 There were common clinical characteristics for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, such as fever, 103 myalgia or fatigue, dry cough, radiographic bilateral patchy shadows or GGOs in the 104 lungs of all patients, low or normal white-cell count or low lymphocyte count\uff0cand no 105 alleviation of symptoms after three-day antimicrobial treatment. Severe lymphopenia 106 was associated to worse outcome of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. (1) On the 107 CT manifestations of case one and case three, the initial small patchy of the lungs 108 quickly developed large bilateral lung shadows within five days, leading to respiratory 109 failure rapidly. Postoperative pneumonia is a frequent complication after lung cancer 110 surgery, as common pneumonia frequently results from pathogenic bacteria. Patients 111 have mortality ranges from 2 % to 3%.(2-5) In this period, 30-day mortality was 1% in 7 our two hospitals. However, two patients died of COVID-19 after lobectomy and one 113 patient survived from severe COVID-19. Patients in epidemic areas should receive 114 chest CT and nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2 before lung surgeries. Protective 115 actions should be taken during the perioperative period. Lung cancer surgeries should 116 be delayed in potential SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. 117 Conclusions 118 Mortality may be very high when patients had SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia after lung 119 lobectomy. Lung surgery should be performed with extreme caution to be performed in 120 SARS-CoV-2 outbreak epidemic areas. 121 122",
