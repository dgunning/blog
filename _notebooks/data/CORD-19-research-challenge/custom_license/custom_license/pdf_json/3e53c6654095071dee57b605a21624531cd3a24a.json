As such, PCI should remain a standard recommendation for limited-stage SCLC patients with response to initial chemoradiotherapy, consistent with the recently published ASTRO guidelines (14, 15) . The standard dose of PCI remains 25Gy in 10 fractions. However, prospective data from extensive-stage patients suggest that deferring PCI in favor of close MRI surveillance can achieve equivalent outcomes without the neurocognitive risks of brain radiation-and in these circumstances, without exposure risk to Therefore, we suggest that risks and benefits of PCI be carefully discussed with all eligible SCLC patients including limited-stage, and that strong consideration during pandemic conditions be given to MRI surveillance as an alternative. This is particularly true for extensive-stage disease, where the benefits of PCI are more questionable and which represents an incurable condition regardless. For extensive-stage patients receiving PCI, a shorter regimen of 20Gy in 5 fractions could be considered. (20) Consolidative thoracic radiation after induction chemotherapy for extensive-stage SCLC has been associated with a survival benefit that led to its incorporation into guidelines as a standard recommendation. (21) However, the magnitude of its benefit is debated, especially with the increasing role of immunotherapy in this setting. (22) As such, individualized discussion of risks and benefits of consolidative thoracic RT is also indicated, and if delivered, should be limited to no more than the established 10-fraction, 30Gy schedule. Since patients recommended consolidative thoracic RT are likely also candidates for PCI, concurrent delivery of thoracic and brain RT is logical under these circumstances.",

Spinal cord dose should be limited to 44Gy with this schedule; patients with particularly extensive nodal involvement requiring irradiation of \u226512cm of the esophagus should receive standard fractionation.(5)For patients not otherwise good candidates for concurrent chemoradiation due to medical comorbidities or impaired functional status, induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy alone is a reasonable choice, particularly as it may allow the deferment of radiotherapy until the pandemic has passed. Though not a validated approach, patients with a targetable driver mutation (sensitizing EGFR mutation, ALK rearrangement, etc.) could also considered for induction systemic therapy as a temporizing measure. In the meantime, hypofractionated schedules are strongly preferred for radiotherapy without concurrent chemotherapy, particularly a 15-fraction schedule. Retrospective data suggest that outcomes after 45Gy in 15 fractions are equivalent to 60Gy in 30 fractions, and this schedule has been endorsed in an ASTRO clinical practice guideline.(6,7) Within the framework of this 15-fraction schedule, selective dose-escalation to doses as high as 60Gy may be considered; this dose is currently being investigated in locally advanced NSCLC patients not receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy in NRG Oncology LU-004.(8)",

Patients in a postoperative state may be at heightened risk for morbidity or mortality from COVID-19, and as such, limiting target volumes to involved regions (positive nodal stations and staple line only) is also prudent. Hypofractionation in the postoperative setting has been associated with more toxicity and is thus not encouraged.(13) Small cell lung cancer-limited-stage Early-stage SCLC (T1-2N0) may be treated with surgery or SBRT, avoiding the need for more fractionated radiotherapy.(14,15) Otherwise, the standard regimen for limited-stage SCLC is 45Gy in twice-daily 1.5Gy regimens. Though this remains the standard, daily treatment such as 66-70Gy in 33-35 fractions appears substantially equivalent.(16) Hyperfractionation vs. daily fractionation under pandemic conditions raises the question of whether minimizing overall treatment length, or length of a given treatment day, is preferred. This choice, in turn, may depend on facility-specific factors such as the effectiveness of the facility's COVID-19",
