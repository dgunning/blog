Furthermore, limits of detection (LOD) were determined with six isolates of Flu. Results: Of the 275 specimens, 63 were positive for FluA by PFAST, 60 were positive by RP, 58 were positive by cIAB and 52 were positive by Xpt. Only a subset of 135 specimens was tested by PFlu, of which 32 were positive. The sensitivity/specificity for PFAST, RP, cIAB, Xpt and PFlu was 100/99.1%, 96.7/99.5%, 91.8/99.1%, 85.2%/ 100%, and 75.6%/98.9%, respectively. LOD analyses demonstrated assay performance variations were strain associated. Specifically, PFlu's and cIAB's LODs were higher with A/Texas/50/2012-like and A/Switzerland/ 9715293/2013-like strains, while Xpt's highest LOD was with the Swiss strain. Conclusions: Strain-associated assay performance variation is known to occur with other Flu test methods; hence, it is not surprising that such variation would be observed with molecular tests. Careful monitoring and reporting for strain-associated variances are warranted for all test methods.",

Specimens, stored at \u221280\u00b0C, after original testing by PFlu/ PFAST (49%, Hologic|Gen-Probe, San Diego, CA) or by RP (51%, BioFire Diagnostics Inc., Salt Lake City, UT), were thawed for testing by cIAB and RP or PFAST, and returned to \u221280\u00b0C. Samples were thawed again for testing by Xpt. Additional archived Flu positive samples were analyzed to assess assay performance against other strains of virus. Additional samples included 50 samples from 2009 positive for FluA, of which 4 were seasonal H1N1 (sH1), 4 were seasonal H3N2 (sH3) and 42 were pdm09 H1N1 (09H1N1); 10 09H1N1 from the 2013 to 2014 season; and 40 FluB from spring 2014 or spring 2015. Samples equivocal for FluA with RP were considered to be positive by that test method [18] . Specimens were defined as true positive if they were positive by two or more assays. Viral nucleic acid concentrations determinations were based on quantified control viral RNA (Hologic|Gen-Probe) using either PFlu or PFAST, depending on amplification efficiency. ",

Originally, it was reported that 32.5% of the USA isolates between September 28-December 6, 2014 were A/Texas/50/2012-like (clade 3C.1) and most of the remaining were antigenically similar to A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (clade 3C.3a) [17] . However, it appears early in the season in the USA, similar rates of clades 3C.2a, 3C.3, and 3C.3a co-circulated; but 3C.2a viruses quickly predominated, representing more than 70% of the virus population by January 2015 [24] .",

Thus, all samples in our lab with requests for PFlu testing, were tested by both PFlu and PFAST. Hologic did modify the PFlu package insert to indicate limitations with our virus, but did little else to warn other customers as they falsely believed the phenomenon was restricted to our region. On the other hand, Cepheid did recognize issues and has made changes to their currently available assays to enable extended Flu and RSV Coverage.",
