For two of them the insert was identified as ubiquitin coding sequence . The genome of BVDV Osloss contains exactly one ubiquitin gene monomer . In the case of BVDV CP1 the cellular insertion comprises one complete ubiquitin gene and part of a second monomer . The host cell-derived element in the CP1 genome is embedded in a large duplication of about 2 .4 kb of viral sequences . Cellular insertion and duplication were not found in the genome of NCP1, the noncytopathogenic counterpart of CP1 . These results strongly suggest that recombination between viral and cellular RNA is responsible for development of the cytopathogenic viruses, which is linked to pathogenesis of a lethal disease in cattle .",

Viral gene expression is believed to occur via synthesis of a polyprotein and subsequent proteolytic processing (Collett et al., 1 988b, c) . With respect to genome organization and strategy of gene expression pestiviruses are more similar to flaviviruses than to togaviruses . It has therefore been proposed to classify the pestiviruses as a new genus of the family Flaviviridae (Collett et at, 1 988c) .",

The insertion of 228 nucleotides identified in the BVDV Osloss genome encodes a complete ubiquitin-like element with only two amino acid exchanges with respect to the ubiquitin sequence conserved in all animals (Meyers at al., 1 989b, 1990) . The sequence of 270 nucleotides which is inserted in the BVDV NADL genome shows no homology to a uhiquitln gene but is almost identical with another bovine mRNA sequence (Meyers et al., 1990) .

Hybridization with probes labeled with 32 P by nick translation (Rigby et al., 1977) (nick translation kit, Amersham-Buchler) was performed in 0 .5 M sodium phosphate, pH 6 .8, 1 mM EDTA, and 7% SDS . Hybridization temperature was 54\u00b0 for the HCV cDNA probe and 68\u00b0 for the ubiquitin probe . Posthybridization washes were carried out with 40 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6 .8, 1 mM EDTA, 5% SDS, and 40 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6 .8, 1 mM EDTA, 1 % SDS two times each for 30 min at hybridization temperature .",

For detection of the genomic viral RNAs an hog cholera virus (HCV)-derived cDNA fragment encompassing nucleotides 4377 to 6532 of the viral genome was used as a probe (Meyers et al., 1989a) .

An analogous experiment was conducted with RNA of cells infected with CP1 and NCP1 . Surprisingly, a positive signal was obtained with genornic Cell RNA after stringent hybridization with the ubiquitin probe ( Fig . 1 B, lane 4) . Since the genornic RNA of BVDV NCP1 is not recognized by this DNA fragment ( Fig . 1 B, lane 3) at least part of the additional RNA in the CP1 genome represents a ubiquitin-like sequence . The three major additional bands visible in all lanes of Fig . 1 B probably represent the host cellular ubiquitin mRNAs since they can also be detected among RNA of noninfected cells ( Fig . 1 B, lane 5) .

NCP1 represents the first noncytopathogenic BVDV strain which has been characterized at the genome level ; a continuous sequence of 3199 nucleotides was determined for the respective clones (Fig . 3A) . In contrast to the two published genomic sequences of cpBVDV strains (Osloss [Renard et al., 1987] and NADL [Collett et al., 1 988a]) the NCP1 RNA does not contain an insertion in the analyzed genomic region . In this aspect NCP1 is most similar to HCV, which also lacks insertions of cellular sequences (Meyers et al., 1 989a The genome organization of BVDV CPI is more complex than that of the other described pestiviruses . Analysis of the sequences of the cDNA clones pCP18 and pCP113 ( Fig . 2 ) resulted in identification of 366 nucleotides of ubiquitin-coding sequence . Thus, in addition to a complete ubiquitin gene of 228 nucleotides which is also found in the BVDV Osloss genome (Meyers etaL, 1989b) , the CP1 genomic RNA contains part of a second ubiquitin-gene monomer truncated at the 5' end ( Fig . 3B) .",

To further investigate this unusual arrangement of the CP1 genome the nucleotide sequence starting about 3 kb upstream and ending more than 4 kb downstream of the ubiquitincoding element of CP1 was determined . Parts of the respective clones (pCPII32 and pCPII46 in Fig obtained from an additional cDNA library constructed after priming with oligonucleotides complementary either to sequences located around nucleotide 9000 of the BVDV genome or to part of the ubiquitin sequence, respectively . As indicated in Fig . 38 and Fig . 5 both the sequences preceding and following the ubiquitin-coding element in the CP1 genome are found again at another position of the determined sequence ( Fig . 5 , box 1 versus 3 and box 2 versus 4, respectively) . Accordingly, in the genome of CP1 the host cell-derived insertion is embedded in a large duplication of viral sequences which corresponds to nucleotides 5380 to 7763 of the BVDV Osloss sequence (Figs . 4 and 5) . Therefore the genomes of NCPI and CPI can only be aligned it either the 5' or the 3' duplicated element is regarded as part of an insertion (Fig . 5 , upper section) . I he duplication together with the 366 nucleotides of ubiquitin-coding sequence comprises 2750 nucleotides and apparently accounts for the observed differences in genome size ( Fig . 1) .",

If for CP1 the 5' duplicated element together with the ubiquitin-coding sequence is regarded as insertion (Fig . 5) , it would be located at exactly the same genomic position as the Osloss inserted element (indicated by the letters A and B in Fig . 4 and Fig . 5 ) . Accordingly the sequences flanking this tentative insertion in the CP1 genome are highly homologous to those adjacent to the Osloss insertion (for CP1 see Fig . 5 , sequences upstream of \"A\" in box 1 and downstream of \"B\" in box 3, respectively ; for Osloss see Fig . 6A ) .

When the 5' borders of the ubiquitin-coding elements were compared the respective viral and host cell-derived sequences are not homologous for both viruses (Fig . 6A) . The situation is different for the 3' ends : Both the CP1 and the Osloss insertion terminate exactly with the end of a ubiquitin gene monomer even though the Osloss ubiquitin has acquired a mutation which changes the carboxyterminal glycine into a serine residue (Fig . 6B ) . Thus at the 3' borders both the host cell-derived and the flanking viral sequences are conserved (Fig . 6A) host cellular RNAs might play a role in a site-specific recombination process (see discussion) .",

As expected precipitation of p125 was observed for all three BVDV strains ( Fig . 7B, lanes 3, 6, and 9 ) . In addition a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 41 kDa (p41) was specifically precipitated from extracts of Osloss-infected cells (Fig . 78, lane 9) . This protein most likely is analogous to p54 of BVDV NADL, and thus represents the second product of p125 processing . The differences in size between p54 of BVDV NADL and p41 of BVDV Osloss indicate differences in the location of at least one of the respective processing sites . If the carboxyterminal cleavage site of this protein is conserved for both viruses, p41 of the Osloss strain should contain the ubiquitin sequence .

This would be in accordance with the genetic map published for BVDV NADL (Collett et al., 1988b) .

Mucosal disease develops only sporadically during years of persistent infection although high virus titers are detectable in the animals, indicating enormous virus replication activity (Baker, 1987) . Thus, statistically, a large number of replication cycles seems to be necessary for a recombination resulting in integration of additional sequences . In addition only recombinants with the ability to cause MD are selected from a probably much larger number of recombinant viruses . To achieve this selective advantage it appears likely that the location of the possible recombination positions as well as the nature of the cellular reaction partner is restricted . That is probably the reason why all three identified insertions are located in the region coding for p125 within a stretch of less than 200 nucleotides, and two of them are derived from ubiquitin-coding sequences .",

The integration of additional sequences described here for BVDV therefore should have occurred at the RNA level . RNA recombination has been reported for different viruses (for review see King et al ., 1987) . In addition to homologous reactions between two molecules of viral RNA (Lai et al ., 1985 ; Saunders et al., 1985 ; Kirkegaard and Baltimore, 1986 ; Makino et al ., 1986 ) much less frequent heterologous recombinations between viral RNAs and other partners, i .e ., tRNA (Monroe and Schlesinger, 1983) or ribosomal RNA (Khatchikian et al., 1989) , have been reported . A so-called \"copy choice'' mechanism has been proposed as the enzymatic basis for both types of reactions (Lazzarini etal., 1981 ; Kirkegaard and Baltimore, 1986 ; King at al., 1987 ; Khatchikian et al., 1989) . Accordingly recombination results from a template switch of the viral RNA polymerase during genome replication . Base pairing between the nascent RNA strand and the recombination partner has been proposed to participate in directing recombination reactions (Lazzarini et al., 1981 ; Lai at a!, 1985 ; Makino et al., 1986 ; King at al., 1987) .",

            "text": "While most RNA recombinations were explained by a single template switch, the integration of host cellular sequences into the genomes of BVDV NADL, Osloss, and CP1 by a copy choice mechanism would represent heterologous reactions requiring two template switches between viral and cellular RNA, As the cellular reaction partner is of positive polarity such a process should occur during viral negative-strand synthesis to result in the observed integration of cellular sequences in coding orientation . Accordingly, the first template switch would determine the 3' border of the insertion while the second one would be responsible for its 5'-end formation . If the second polymerase jump occurred to a position downstream of the first \"crossng-over'' point a duplication as observed for CP1 would result (Fig . 10) . Switching back to the original position could generate a genome as found for Osloss and NADL . For a \"backward switch\" as postulated for CP1 less stringent conditions can be imagined as long as the increase in genome size resulting from the duplication does not interfere with virion formation . The conserved location of the 3' ends of the ubiquitin-coding elements of BVDV Osloss and CP1 as well as the integration of cellular sequences into the genomes of Osloss and NADL without any duplication or deletion argues, however, in favor of specific and directed processes . Base pairing between the nascent viral negative strand and the sequences downstream of a ubiquitin gene monomer in one of the two analyzed bovine polyubiquitin mRNAs (rpubl or rpub2) should not occur . As already mentioned above the rpubl mRNA could hybridize to positive-stranded BVDV genomic RNA directly upstream of the first recombination point . A template switch during negative-strand synthesis just at this region of base pairing would lead to formation of the conserved 3' recombination product (Fig .  11) . After copying part of the ubiquitin-coding sequence the polymerise would then execute a second template switch back to the viral RNA (Fig . 10) (Table 1) . The nucleotide sequences of the ubiquitin-coding elements in the genomes of BVDV Osloss and CP1 exhibit only six differences (Fig . 6A) . It therefore seems likely that in both recombinations the same type of ubiquitin mRNA was involved . This low number of differences between the Osloss and CP1 ubiquitin insertions also indicates conservation of the host cell-derived sequences within the viral genomes . Because of this observation recombination between BVDV genomic RNA and rpubl and subsequent mutation of the ubiquitin-coding sequences at a frequency necessary for the observed differences seems rather unlikely . Therefore a template switch guided by the proposed interaction between BVDV genomic RNA and rpubl may not be responsible for the observed integration of ubiquitin coding sequences . negative strand synthesis While the two insertions containing ubiquitin-coding elements (BVDV strains CP1 and Osloss) are located at exactly the same genomic position, the BVDV NADL insertion is found about 150 nucleotides upstream of the other two and its flanking viral sequences are completely different from those of the Osloss and CP1 insertions (Meyers et al., 1990) . In addition no conservation of distinct nucleotide sequence elements like inverted or direct repeats are detectable in the sequences adjacent to the inserted elements nor do computer calculations reveal striking secondary structures in the respective regions of the RNA (data not shown) . Thus no obvious recombination motif respon- ' BVDV Os1 .05s/fl FiG . 11 .

In the case of BVDV this evolutionary force becomes obvious by the connection of the recombination process with both pathogenesis of mucosal disease and development of cytopathogenicity . Identification of the BVDV recombination was facilitated by the biological selection system \"mucosal disease\" but analogous processes may of course also happen with other RNA viruses . A recombination between influenza virus RNA and ribosomal RNA which also led to a virus with altered biological properties has been observed (Khatchikian et al., 1989) .
