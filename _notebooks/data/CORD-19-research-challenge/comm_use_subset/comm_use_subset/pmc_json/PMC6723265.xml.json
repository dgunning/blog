EAV infects horses and donkeys and leads to abortions in pregnant mares and respiratory illness with flu-like symptoms, which can even lead to death in young animals. The virus is transmitted via the respiratory route and via the contaminated semen of previously infected stallions. Despite available vaccines, EAV remains an important pathogen in the horse industry [2].",

            "text": "The structural proteins of arteriviruses include the nucleocapsid N and several membrane proteins, such as the Gp5/M dimer, the Gp2/3/4 complex, the small and hydrophobic E protein, and the ORF5a protein [5]. All structural proteins, in addition to ORF5a, are essential for EAV infectivity; however, only N along with viral RNA and Gp5/M dimer is required for budding. Note that Gp2, Gp3, Gp4, and E are minor viral components, and knocking them out individually from EAV does not prevent the budding of non-infectious virus-like particles (VLPs) [6]. If one of the genes encoding Gp2, Gp3, or Gp4 is deleted, the produced VLPs do not contain any Gp2/3/4 trimer component and have reduced the amount of the E protein. If the E protein is knocked out the Gp2/3/4 trimer, it is not incorporated into the virion particles, suggesting the involvement of E in the assembly of infectious particles containing the trimer [6]. The trimer itself serves as a major tropism determinant for arteriviruses. The chimeric PRRSV arterivirus, containing E and Gp2/3/4 exchanged to homolog proteins of EAV, exhibits broadened cellular tropism of the EAV [7]. In PRRSV, the Gp2/3/4 was shown to attach to the CD163 cellular receptor on the porcine alveolar macrophages [8]. Recently, genome-edited pigs, lacking part of the CD163 receptor, were shown to be resistant to the PRRSV challenge [9]. E is a small, hydrophobic protein suspected to serve as a viroporin [10]. The Gp2 and Gp4 are type I integral membrane proteins [5]. The Gp3 is a peculiar protein, which was shown to form a disulfide-linked trimer with only Gp2/4 in the virus particles, and the trimer cannot be detected in the infected cells [11].",

The mutant viruses exhibited similar growth proprieties. Gp3-HA was incorporated into the virions and formed multimeric complexes, corresponding to the Gp2/3/4 trimer size. The EAVGp3-HA mutant enabled us to localize Gp3-HA using secretory pathway markers and other EAV proteins. We have shown that Gp3-HA have similar distribution as the E protein, i.e., it mainly localize in the ER, while some of it is moved to cis-Golgi. Finally, we demonstrated that the arterivirus genome tolerates the separation of the ORFs in virion structural genes and that the small tag can be introduced into Gp3 without loss in infectivity of the EAV virus. These results can be implemented for the development of new arteriviral vaccines.",

Newly constructed plasmids were propagated in competent Escherichia coli strain DH5alpha (Thermo Scientific, Warszawa, Poland). Cloning vector pEAV211, which is a derivate of the pEAV030 (Genbank Y07862.2) and described in reference [17], was used to generate mutant EAVs. We generated specific DNA fragments by overlap extension PCR and purified them from the gel with the aid of the Gel-out kit (A&A Biotechnology, Gdansk, Poland). RGEAVBamHI and RGEAVEcoRI were used as an external primers. First, the translation initiation codon of the EAV ORF4 was mutated (ATG > ACG) with primers Gp4KOFor and Gp4KORev, and the 2.345 bp fragment cloned back to pEAV211 with the restriction enzymes BamHI and EcoRI (Thermo Scientific, Poland) to generate pEAV211Gp4KO. In the second step, the AscI site was added after the stop codon of the ORF3 with primers EAV211AscIFor and EAV211AscIRev to generate the plasmid pEAV211Gp4KOAscI. The separation of the ORF3 and ORF4 was achieved by the overlap extension PCR with primers ReconAscGp4For and RGEAVEcoRI on the pEAV211 template and cloned to pEAV2114KOAscI with the AscI and EcoRI restriction enzymes to generate pEAV211s3/4. As the last step, the HA tag was added directly to ORF3\u2019s 3\u2019-end with the use of primers RGEAVBamHIIFor and EAVGp3HARev and pEAV211s3/4 as a DNA template. The ligation after BamHI and AscI restriction enzyme digestion of the 1657 bp product produced the pEAV211Gp3-HA vector. All of the generated plasmids were sequenced with the RGEAVEcoRIRev primer (Genomed, Warszawa, Poland). Table 1 shows the list of used primers, while Figure 1 shows the cloning schematics.

The ORF4 3\u2019-end overlaps with two ORFs coding Gp5 and ORF5a proteins. Moreover, joining the HA-tag directly with the Gp3 did not abolish the expression of Gp3 [20], while the direct tagging of Gp2 with FLAG-tag made its expression impossible [21]. The cloning procedure is shown in Figure 1A. First, the start codon of Gp4 was mutated to produce the Gp4 knock-out virus, and then the restriction site AscI was generated to allow the separation of ORF3 and ORF4 by duplicating the missing ORF4 98 nt long sequence. Finally, the HA-tag sequence was directly inserted to the end of ORF3. All these mutations were generated using PCR methods. Subsequently, the in vitro-transcribed full-length viral RNAs from the XhoI-linearized plasmids pEAV211, pEAV211s3/4, and pEAV211Gp3-HA were introduced into the BHK-21 cells using electroporation. After 48 h, the cells were harvested and examined by western blotting analysis using antibodies that are specific to the N protein and HA-tag. The expression of Gp3-HA was only observed in cells transfected with in vitro-transcribed RNA produced from pEAV211Gp3-HA; however, it was not observed in pEAV211 (wt), pEAV211s3/4, or mock-transfected cells. Note that the size of the Gp3-HA was ~35 kDa (Figure 1B). As shown in Figure 1B, which shows the successful replication of the EAV, the expression of the N protein was observed in cells transfected with in vitro-transcribed RNA produced from pEAV211 (wt), pEAV211s3/4, and pEAV211Gp3-HA, but not in the mock-transfected cells.",

The expression of Gp3-HA was analyzed by IF using cells infected with P7, P10, P15, and P19 (Figure 2B). The levels of N and Gp3-HA protein expression was stable up to P15; however, in cells infected with P19, the number of cells expressing Gp3-HA and fluorescence intensity were reduced. To determine whether these results were caused by the emergence of viruses containing mutations, the intracellular RNA was isolated after infection with P7, P10, P15, and P19 EAVGp3-HA virus and subjected to RT-PCR, followed by sequence analysis (Figure 2C). Note that the consensus sequence was still present in P19; however, the chromatogram of the nt sequence of the HA-tag and the neighboring sequence showed the presence of mutated nucleotides, which may indicate the rise of the quasispecies viruses with accumulated mutations within the HA-tag sequence. Such quasispecies of viruses, which are present in the supernatant along with the original recombinant virus, can lead to diminished fluorescence intensity and loss of fluorescence from the HA-tag in certain infected cells. To summarize, this data indicate that the separation of ORF3 and ORF4 and introduction of Gp3-tag can be stably accommodated within the EAV genome and that the HA-tag added to C-terminus of Gp3 is expressed at least up to P15.",

Cell lysates were subjected to both non-reducing and reducing SDS-PAGE, followed by western blotting with anti-HA antibodies. In the non-reducing conditions, most of the Gp3-HA protein was present at the band of ~35 kDa, and only a small fraction migrated to two faint bands of ~50 kDa (Figure 3A). This indicates that the Gp3-HA in infected cells is present mostly in the monomeric form; however, some of it forms a multimeric structure that might correspond to the Gp3-HA dimer or the Gp3-HA associated with other viral or cellular proteins. In reducing conditions, the Gp3-HA displays a characteristic double-band pattern, which is caused by the heterologous glycosylation of the overlapping NNTT sequon, indicating that certain Gp3-HA molecules have 5 and some have 6 N-glycans [20]. To confirm that Gp3-HA in infected cells is indeed N-glycosylated, the cell lysates were digested with peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) (cleaves of all types of N-linked carbohydrates) or endo-\u03b2-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (Endo H; cleaves only the high-mannose-type carbohydrates) prior to SDS-PAGE (Figure 3A). The carbohydrate chains from the intracellular Gp3 were completely cleaved by both these enzymes, confirming that Gp3-HA is retained in ER or a cis-Golgi compartment, as Endo H cannot cleave the N-glycans with additional modifications occurring in the medial or trans-Golgi. Therefore, the Gp3-HA expressed in infected cells exhibits the same behavior as in previously published data for the wild-type Gp3 [13,20,22].",

After 22 h post-infection, the supernatants were collected, centrifuged at low speed, and purified using filter devices. A major part of the purified virus sample (95%) was subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-HA antibodies, and analyzed using SDS-PAGE under non-reducing and reducing conditions. As expected, in non-reducing conditions, the Gp3-HA was present in virions in small amounts and was barely visible without precipitation (Figure 3B). In the sample subjected to IP, Gp3-HA was present at a band of 35 kDa and a band of 70 kDa. These apparent molecular masses correspond to the Gp3-HA monomer and Gp2/Gp3-HA/Gp4 trimer. In reducing conditions, only the monomeric form was present, suggesting that the multimeric form detected in the virions in the non-reducing condition is because of the covalent linkage of Gp3-HA to other minor proteins of EAV. Moreover, additional bands were present in the mock samples, which is probably because of IP and western blotting being performed using the same antibody. Unfortunately, detection of Gp3-HA with different anti-HA antibody in western blotting failed (mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody, Enzo). In reducing conditions, the 50 kDa band is possible an antibody heavy chain; however, in non-reducing conditions, the bands indicated with triangles are probably detected covalently bond light and heavy chains of the antibodies used in IP. It is possible, that those antibody-derived bands might hide some bands coming from the targeting protein or protein complex. Therefore, we can assume that at least monomeric and trimeric Gp3-HA was present in the virion, but other forms cannot be excluded.",

A few reasons for this phenomenon are as follows. First, minor proteins might not be present at the assembly site. If Gp5/M, which is indispensable for VLPs formation, is located primarily in the Golgi, it could be the main budding site. In our study, we have shown that only some fraction of Gp3-HA is also located in the cis-Golgi, while a majority of it seems to be retained in ER. Only properly folded and assembled transmembrane proteins are exported from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [29]. It is possible that the complex Gp2/Gp4 dimer, as well as Gp3 and E, moved to the Golgi, while monomers remained in ER. Unfortunately, the Gp3-HA does not form a disulfide-linked trimer in the cell; therefore, we could not perform the fractionation of internal membranes to see if the Gp3-HA did move from the ER to the Golgi on oligomerization with Gp2 and Gp4. Disulfide-linked trimer formation is mediated after virion release, preferably at more basic pH [11]. We also detected the higher forms of Gp3-HA in non-reducing conditions only in virions.",

Clearly, for the production of VLPs, the nucleocapsid N coupled with RNA and the Gp5/M heterodimer formation is essential [6,30]. This is in contrast to the assembly of Coronaviridae (which are in the same order as Arteriviridae\u2014Nidovirales), in which only the M and E proteins drive virion budding [31]. The failure to achieve budding by co-expression of only N, Gp5, and M without the EAV RNA suggests that there are additional factors in the EAV particle formation. It is possible that the arterivirus assembly is coupled to viral genome replication, interaction of RNA with structural proteins, or to the expression of non-structural proteins.",

However, the factors that control the site of budding in well-studied Coronaviruses are unknown. When expressed independently or during an infection, many coronaviral proteins pass through the ERGIC and localize in the Golgi complex, e.g., the spike S protein is expressed even on the plasma membrane [33,34].",

If the budding occurs where the Gp5/M is localized, this could be the mechanism of lower incorporation into the virions of minor proteins, i.e., they are not abundant at the assembly site. In this study, we have shown that the Gp3-HA and E localized mainly in the ER. However, the mechanism of lower incorporation of the E and minor glycoproteins in Arteriviruses might be different, and not dependent on the localization of the proteins. In coronaviruses the E protein, which is essential for virion formation, remains at the budding site, but is incorporated into virions in small amounts, by unknown mechanism [36]. In the influenza A virus the M2 protein is excluded from the budozone, presumably because it localizes at the edges of the lipid rafts at plasma membrane, the site of Infuenza A budding [37,38]. Further experiments are needed to explain lower incorporation of the minor proteins into EAV virions.",
