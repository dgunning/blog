The family of PRRs includes secreted, membrane-bound and cytosolic PRRs [1]. Pathogenic organisms use sophisticated strategies to modulate PRR recognition and to control downstream signaling. Accordingly, the human enteropathogen Shigella exploits different mechanisms to hijack the innate immune response. The Shigella genus includes 4 serogroups: S. boydi, S. dysenteriae, S. flexneri and S. sonnei. and S. flexneri are the main serogroups circulating in industrialized and developing countries respectively [2], but most studies centered on the invasion process of Shigella in vitro and in vivo have been carried out with S. flexneri.",

            "text": "Shigella penetrates epithelial cells through a series of effectors secreted via a Type 3 Secretion System (T3SS) [3] encoded by a large virulence plasmid common to all Shigella serogroups. Once inside the colonic mucosa, shigellae either fuel or dampen the inflammatory response, depending on the step of the invasion process. In epithelial cells, Shigella multiplies freely within the cytoplasm [4] where the cytosolic PRR Nod1 recognizes cell-wall peptidoglycan (PGN) and activates NF-\u03baB [5,6]. This leads to CXCL8/IL-8 production. IL-8 attracts neutrophils which are required for the clearance of shigellae but which also participate in the destruction of the epithelial barrier [7]. Within epithelial cells, S. flexneri changes its lipopolysaccharide (LPS) structure from a highly inflammatory hexa-acylated lipid A form to a less inflammatory tetra- and tri-acylated lipid A variant [8]. This low-inflammatory LPS is poorly recognized by the PRR Toll-Like-Receptor 4 (TLR4), making macrophages and neutrophils less able to control the infection. Furthermore, in B lymphocytes Shigella induces TLR2-mediated apoptotic death through a mechanism mediated by T3SS, independent of cell invasion [9]. These immune evasion strategies involve TLR2 and TLR4, which are PRRs present on the surface of many cell populations, suggesting that the extracellular step could be critical for successful infection. To gain insight about this poorly explored aspect of Shigella pathogenesis we analyzed the potential role of humoral PRRs, focusing on the possible involvement of Pentraxin 3 (PTX3), which has served as a paradigm of humoral innate immunity [10].",

Pentraxins are an evolutionarily highly conserved superfamily of proteins. PTX3 is the prototypic long pentraxin, while the short pentraxins include C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid P component (SAP), acute-phase proteins in man and mouse respectively. PTX3 is rapidly produced and released by several cell types, e.g. mononuclear phagocytes, dendritic cells (DCs) and neutrophils [11] in response to primary inflammatory signals (e.g. TLR engagement, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2). PTX3 binds selected microorganisms, including Aspergillus fumigatus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa [12, 13] and uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) [14]. It also promotes complement activation, thereby facilitating pathogen recognition by phagocytes [15]. All these features prompted us to investigate whether PTX3 could play a role in Shigella pathogenesis and how and to what extent this PRR is released upon Shigella infection. Our findings highlight that PTX3 is a new player in the Shigella cross-talk with the infected tissues and provide novel insights into the mechanisms of Shigella to control the production of this humoral PRR.",

Hence, we assessed whether deficiency of PTX3 could affect the virulence of Shigella. With this aim Ptx3-/- mice were infected via intranasal route with M90T as above and the animals were monitored for a week. We found that Ptx3-/- mice challenged with M90T showed an accelerated death with respect to M90T-infected wild type mice (p < 0.046, two-tailed Mantel-Cox test) as the majority (75%: 20/30) of the animals died after 48 hours p.i.

M90T- and BS176-killed bacteria potentially could be phagocytized by DCs; however, the invasive ability of M90T was destroyed. The release of PTX3 did not change in BMDCs infected with killed BS176. In contrast, the PTX3 values induced by killed M90T were significantly higher than those recorded with live M90T. Then, we prevented cell internalization of bacteria by treating the cells with cytochalasin D, which disrupts cytoskeleton organization [36]. In contrast to the previous approach, here invasive and non-invasive bacteria could not be internalized by the cells. Under this condition the PTX3 values induced by M90T were comparable to those of BS176 (Fig 4C).",

BMDMs were primed with M90T aLPS (mainly hexa-acylated), M90T iLPS (mainly tetra-acylated) and M90T \u0394msbB1 \u0394msbB2 LPS (mainly penta-acylated) and were then infected with M90T at MOI 10. Infected BMDMs primed with iLPS and M90T \u0394msbB1 \u0394msbB2 LPS (both LPSs hypo-acylated) released significantly less PTX3 than those primed with aLPS (Fig 5B), while the amount of TNF-\u03b1 was similar for all the LPSs, as already shown [8] (S5B Fig). Then, we stimulated the BMDMs (without infection) with the three Shigella LPS (10 ng/mL) as above for 6 h. PTX3 and TNF-\u03b1 yields were lower with iLPS and M90T \u0394msbB1 \u0394msbB2 LPS (both LPSs hypoacylated) than with aLPS (Fig 5C and S5C Fig). To evaluate the relative role of structural LPS on live bacteria and LPS priming, BMDMs were primed with different LPSs and then infected with M90T \u0394msbB1 \u0394msbB2 (carrying a penta-acylated LPS) instead of M90T (carrying a hexa-acylated LPS) as above. PTX3 release followed the trend observed with M90T, which was consistent with the acylation degree of the LPSs used for priming; however, M90T \u0394msbB1 \u0394msbB2 triggered a significantly lower release of PTX3 compared to M90T for each condition, in accordance with the hypo-acylation degree of its LPS (Fig 5D). For TNF-\u03b1, the difference between M90T and M90T \u0394msbB1 \u0394msbB2 was maintained, while no significant difference was induced by priming with the various LPSs as for PTX3(S5D Fig). We then examined whether MoMs (peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages) respond to Shigella infection and LPS stimulation as observed with BMDMs, BMDCs and MoDCs. With this aim, MoMs were infected with either: M90T, BS176, M90T \u0394msbB1 \u0394msbB2 or stimulated with the different LPS and both PTX3 and TNF-\u03b1 production was evaluated. When infected with M90T, BS176 or M90T \u0394msbB1 \u0394msbB2, PTX3 (Fig 5E) and TNF-\u03b1 yields (S5E Fig) were significantly higher with BS176 than with M90T. This result was consistent with that seen in BMDMs, BMDC and MoDCs. Likewise, M90T \u0394msbB1 \u0394msbB2 induced the lowest PTX3 and TNF-\u03b1 production in accordance with its LPS structure and as also observed in BMDMs and MoDCs. In MoMs stimulated with the four forms of LPS (M90T iLPS and aLPS, M90T \u0394msbB1 \u0394msbB2 and E. coli LPS), iLPS and M90T \u0394msbB1 \u0394msbB2 LPS induced the lowest production of PTX3 (Fig 5F) and TNF-\u03b1, just as for BMDMs (S5F Fig).",

In vitro, PTX3 opsonization impairs Shigella internalization in epithelial cells, which are the replicative niche of this pathogen. Likewise, PTX3 binds human cytomegalovirus and inhibits viral-cell fusion and internalization, supposedly by crosslinking of glycoproteins on viral or cellular surface [43]. PTX3 binding to Shigella might inhibit bacteria-host cell contact by interfering sterically with the T3SS machinery thereby affecting bacterial micropinocytosis. Antibodies directed against Shigella surface structures have been shown to prevent epithelial cell internalization [23, 24, 44 and this study] and to promote the opsonophagocytic activity in macrophages [45]. In this light, PTX3 opsonization is reminiscent of some in vitro properties of protective antibodies against Shigella external structures, thus contributing to Shigella eradication before the adaptive immune response is mounted. These features reveal a role of PTX3 as an \u201cante-antibody\u201d [16, 44] in Shigella infections. At a local level of infection, extracellular Shigella that are no longer protected by the host cell cytoplasm, can be targeted by the complement system and easily internalized by macrophages, thus improving the bacterial clearance by the tissues as we observed in lungs of PTX3-treated mice. Indeed, Shigella is sensitive to the serum bactericidal activity (this study), and low concentrations of PTX3 increase the killing activity of complement. It is unsurprising that PTX3 contributes to complement activity only at low concentrations given that it can play a double role, either by activating the three complement pathways or by negatively regulating them through various mechanisms, thereby limiting complement-mediated inflammation [21].",

In Ptx3-/- infected mice the inflammatory response seemed to be exacerbated, as the production of TNF-\u03b1, CXCL1 and CXCL2 was significantly higher than in wild type animals. In contrast, in lungs of PTX3-treated infected mice low levels of CXCL1 and CXCL2 were associated with few areas filled by a neutrophilic exudate. PTX3 can also directly contribute to local regulation of the inflammatory reaction based on neutrophil infiltrate as it binds to the adhesion molecule P-selectin and inhibits leukocyte rolling in the endothelium [47].

In contrast to the attenuated strains, which are likely confined to the epithelial layer, fully virulent shigellae break the integrity of the epithelial barrier and penetrate into the mucosa where they induce severe inflammation characterized by a huge amount of cytokines and inflammatory factors, which can act as signals to promote PTX3 release. In line with this issue, in plasma of patients with shigellosis (infected with S. sonnei) the levels of PTX3 correlate positively with the severity of symptoms, particularly with high temperature and blood in the stools being a reliable parameter of severity of shigellosis, just as in conditions like sepsis [49] and critical infections [50].",

Moreover, bronchial epithelial cells express and produce PTX3 upon TNF-\u03b1 trigger, but not following bacterial PAMP stimulation (such as LPS) [52]. We could suggest that in natural and experimental shigellosis, epithelial cells cannot or barely produce PTX3 upon initial bacterial contact. PTX3 is likely to be released only when inflammatory signals like TNF-\u03b1 and especially IL-1\u03b2 are present. Upon inflammatory activation, neutrophils release about 25% of their pre-formed PTX3 content in lactoferrin granules [53].
