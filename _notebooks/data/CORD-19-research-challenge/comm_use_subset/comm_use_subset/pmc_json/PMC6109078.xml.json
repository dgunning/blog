            "text": "New and emerging viral infections impose a significant burden on human health and on the world economy. The majority of emerging infectious diseases affecting humans today are of animal origin with approximately three quarters arising from wildlife1. Bats have been shown to harbour more zoonotic viruses than other mammalian species2,3 and are implicated in outbreaks of a number of highly pathogenic zoonotic viruses, including filoviruses, coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses and reoviruses. Ebola virus (EboV) RNA and antibodies have been discovered in African fruit bats4. The largest human outbreak of EboV occurred in West Africa in 2013\u20132014, resulting in nearly 30,000 infections and 11,000 deaths and took over a year to contain5. SARS coronavirus emerged in China in 2002 and infected over 8000 people causing 774 deaths6 and the MERS coronavirus continues to infect people and cause death in the Middle East7. Bats have since been found to harbour a multitude of coronaviruses closely related to SARS and MERS8,9. Pteropid bats are the reservoir hosts for the deadly henipaviruses, Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV)10,11. NiV continues to cause fatal encephalitis in humans almost annually in Bangladesh, while HeV has spilled-over into horses in Australia nearly every year since 2004 and has killed four people12,13. Orthoreoviruses have been isolated from bats and humans in Southeast Asia where they have caused flu-like illness in people14. Known zoonotic viruses of bat origin continue to be of concern for human and animal health, and active surveillance provides our best option for monitoring these agents as well as identifying novel pathogens of zoonotic potential.",

AchPV1 and AchPV2 are newly recognised viral species in the family Paramyxoviridae, where they cluster with other bat rubulaviruses. Despite being discovered in the same study, the AchPVs are not nearest-phylogenetic relatives and share only 31 to 64% protein amino acid identities15. Their relationship to each other is similar to their relationships with other bat rubulaviruses such as Sosuga (SosPV), Menangle (MenPV) and Tioman (TioPV) viruses (sharing 58\u201370% N protein amino acid sequence identities), which have been shown to cause human infection. SosPV was isolated from a wildlife biologist studying bats and rodents in Africa in 2012 and is believed to be the causative agent for a severe flu-like illness and skin rash16. Follow up investigations revealed the presence of this virus in the spleen of Rousettus aegyptiacus bats17. MenPV first emerged in a piggery in NSW, Australia, in 1997 causing reproductive disease in pigs18. Two piggery workers had flu-like illness during the outbreak and were later found to have MenPV neutralising antibodies. Serological evidence of MenPV infection was also found in flying foxes roosting near the piggery and the virus was later isolated from Pteropus alecto urine18,19. TioPV was isolated from pteropid bat urine on Tioman Island in 2001 during the search for the reservoir host of Nipah virus20. It was later found that humans on the island had neutralising antibodies to TioPV, although no associated disease has been reported21.",

In addition, a survey of human sera collected from Ghana and Tanzania detected AchPV2 neutralising antibodies in three of 442 samples tested, however no neutralising antibodies to AchPV1 were detected in these sera. Two of the antibody positive samples were from healthy adults and one was from a febrile paediatric patient15.

            "text": "We investigated the potential of the two recently discovered bat rubulaviruses, AchPV1 and AchPV2, to infect laboratory animals representing three species (ferret, guinea pig and mouse). Seroconversion to both Achimota viruses in ferrets and guinea pigs indicated these animals were susceptible to infection, however mice did not seroconvert to either virus. Due to their body size, mice were given a lower dose of inoculum, and were challenged intranasally, rather than via the oronasal route used for the ferrets and guinea pigs. The difference in volume and inoculation route may account for the lack of seroconversion seen in the mice, however it is probably more likely that this species is resistant to infection. Higher levels of neutralising antibodies were observed in the ferrets and guinea pigs infected with AchPV2 compared to those infected with AchPV1. This result reflected in vitro data where it was observed previously that AchPV2 consistently grows to a higher titre than AchPV1 in vero and PaKi cell lines15. Additionally, respiratory tract disease in one of two ferrets given either AchPV1 or AchPV2 was seen in the observational studies, although it remains unclear if this was related to Achimota virus infection or was entirely due to co-infection by an unknown pathogen. AchPV2 was chosen for a time-course study based on two criteria: higher neutralising antibodies observed in ferrets and guinea pigs compared to AchPV1, and previous evidence of human infection (AchPV2 neutralising antibodies). Given more time and resources, it would be worthwhile to do an additional time course study with AchPV1, to further investigate the differences between these two viruses.",

Evidence of infection was supported by virus re-isolation from clinical specimens and post-mortem tissue samples, and viral antigen detection in tissues by quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. Although there was evidence of mild malaise in infected ferrets (raised body temperature and weight loss), a distinct clinical syndrome with specific clinical signs was not identified in either ferrets or guinea pigs. Moreover, no histological lesions were attributed with confidence to infection by AchPV2. Mild tonsillitis, tracheitis and bronchiolitis were recorded in ferrets, but in some animals the lesions were identified without evidence of specific association with AchPV2 antigen. The ferrets were sourced from a colony free of influenza and canine distemper virus, were clinically healthy at the time of exposure to AchPV2, and were not maintained on a particulate substrate. The pathogenesis of these legions remains uncertain, although an opportunistic bacterial or other viral aetiology could not be excluded. In other tissues, such as bile duct epithelium and transitional epithelial cells of the bladder, viral antigen was seen without substantial inflammatory reaction or tissue injury.",

The results of quantitative real-time PCR, virus re-isolation and immunohistochemistry taken together identified the major sites of AchPV2 replication in ferrets to be respiratory tract epithelium and associated lymphoid tissues. Virus was able to be re-isolated from all of the ferrets at all time points from at least one tissue or clinical sample (swab or nasal wash) but not from blood. Although virus was not re-isolated from blood, the development of viremia may be inferred by confirmation of infection within spleen and urinary tract epithelium by immunohistochemistry and viral genome detection in the blood by quantitative real-time PCR. In the absence of other clinico-pathological support for CNS infection, virus in blood may also account for the re-isolation of AchPV2 from one sample of ferret brain tissue.",

There is no reliable method to determine the best species simply by characterising the virus, which is a big limitation of using virus discovery as a stand-alone surveillance strategy for zoonotic pathogen discovery. Therefore, it is only possible to do what is practical and feasible in terms of assessing potential spill-over hosts.

Room temperature was maintained at 22 \u00b0C with 15 air changes per hour and humidity varied between 40 and 60%.
