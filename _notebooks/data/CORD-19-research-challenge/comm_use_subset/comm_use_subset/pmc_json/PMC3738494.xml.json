Whilst HSV-1 is largely responsible for outbreaks of vesicular oral skin lesions (fever blisters, or cold sores), it can also cause a variety of more severe diseases including encephalitis, meningitis and keratitis [1], [2]. Furthermore, the frequency of association with genital lesions (previously associated mainly with HSV-2 infection) is increasing. As co-infection with HSV is a significant contributing factor to transmission of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), our understanding of HSV disease, and herpesviruses in general, has wide implications for global healthcare.",

The equilibrium between these two infection states requires a fine balance between innate and adaptive immune responses, and viral immune evasion mechanisms [4]. Whilst aspects of the HSV-1 replication cycle have been intensively investigated, there remain gaps in our understanding of the complexity of virus:host interactions. For example, a proteomics study identified over 100 changes in the cellular proteome within the first 6h of infection with HSV-1 [5], and a recent analysis of virion-incorporated cellular proteins found that about 30% of these directly affected virus growth [6].",

Based on these genome-scale studies and individual interactions found by literature curation, several virus-host interaction databases have been created including the HIV-1, human protein interaction database at NCBI [28], VirHostNet [29], VirusMINT [30], PIG [31] and HPIDB [32].

As herpesviruses encode a large number of proteins, in contrast to small RNA viruses such as HIV and Influenza, many cellular processes may be directly affected by viral proteins, and whilst there exists a wealth of information on individual viral proteins, there remain large gaps in our understanding of the HSV-1 life cycle and its interaction with its host. Here, we present data from the first integrative and systematic screening approach to characterise the role of cellular proteins in the HSV-1 life cycle. A genome-scale RNAi knockdown screen to identify HFs functionally influencing HSV-1 replication was performed in parallel with a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) protein interaction screen to simultaneously gain insight into potential mechanisms of action. Combined analyses confirmed the importance of known cellular proteins involved in processes such as cell cycle, proteins transport and gene expression important for virus replication. Furthermore, we identified a subunit of the Mediator multi-protein complex, Med23, as a key regulator of IFN-\u03bb induction, which appears to be of crucial significance for the control of HSV-1 both in vitro and in vivo. These data demonstrate the power of a combined screening strategy to investigate pathogen:host interactions and identify novel host factors and cellular pathway targets for the development of essential clinical interventions.",

To generate a robust and reliable dataset the screen was carried out three times in triplicate, with one replicate used in a cell viability assay to determine any cytotoxic effects of gene depletion and duplicates infected for the virus infection assay. The siRNA library was reverse-transfected into Hela cells before infecting with HSV-1 and monitoring virus growth kinetics as a measure of GFP-fluorescence (\nFigure 1b\n). By following virus growth over multiple rounds of replication, host proteins involved in all stages of the virus life cycle can be identified. Replication slopes during linear growth were normalized to controls (mock-transfected cells, and cells transfected with a siRNA unable to be processed by the RNA Silencing Complex, RSCF) and the mean of six replicates was calculated. siRNAs found to be cytotoxic (81 in total) were excluded from further analyses, and a hitlist of 358 containing the top 2.5% inhibitory and the top 2.5% enhancing HFs was generated (Table S1 in Text S2). The identified HSV-1 HFs were compared to datasets from published siRNA depletion screens aimed at identifying cellular factors affecting HIV-1 [7], [8], [9], West Nile Virus (WNV) [14], Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) [13], Dengue virus [15] and Influenza A virus [10], [11], [12]. Of our 358 HFs, 54 cellular proteins (15.1%) overlapped with these other virus screens (Influenza A, 29; HIV-1, 24; HCV, 6; WNV, 2; Dengue virus, 1) (\nFigure 1c\n\n; Table S2 in Text S2).",

To gain further mechanistic insight into host factors involved in HSV-1 infection, in parallel to the siRNA depletion screen we carried out a yeast two-hybrid protein interaction screen to identify cellular interaction partners of viral proteins. We generated a collection of 107 partial and full-length HSV-1 cDNA constructs and tested them for interactions with proteins encoded by a library of 12,381 human cDNA clones [35]. 231 HSV-1-human protein interactions were detected once (low confidence), and 63 more than once (high-confidence)(Table S3 in Text S2). Using these high-confidence interactions, the previously reported HSV-1 interactome [36] was connected into a human interactome (62,310 published protein interactions) to generate a combined pathogen-host interactome (Figure S1a). Both degree centrality (which indicates the number of interactions a protein has, where high values represent highly interactive \u2018hubs\u2019) and betweenness centrality (which indicates the number of shortest paths between any pair of proteins passing through the protein considered) were significantly increased for HSV-1 interactors, particularly in the high-confidence network (Figure S1b\u2013e). These data suggest HSV-1 proteins preferentially target highly connected central human proteins in the cellular interaction network, similar to other viruses [23].",

From this combined analysis, a subset of HFs was chosen for further validation. Protein interactions were tested in a mammalian cell system by LUMIER pull-down assay [37]. Of the 45 interactions tested, 26 (57.8%) were confirmed, with 15 strongly positive (z-score >2) and 11 weakly positive (z-score 1\u20132) (Figure S1g). siRNA deconvolution (4 siRNAs per gene tested individually) was used to further validate 72 HFs (\nFigure 2b\n\n; Figure S2). The replication phenotype could be confirmed (\u22652 or more siRNAs gave the same or better replication slope than observed in the primary screen) in a high proportion (83.3%) of candidates, highlighting the reliability of the primary screen dataset. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of mRNA expression levels found a minimum depletion of 60% (mean 88%) in a subset of 52 genes (data not shown; Table S6 in Text S2) confirming the observed effects on HSV-1 replication are genuine and not due to \u2018off-target\u2019 effects or insufficient gene knockdown. To further investigate the virus-specificity of our identified HFs, we tested this subset for their effect on the replication of an additional \u03b1-herpesvirus (Varicella-Zoster virus, VZV), the \u03b2-herpesvirus Cytomegalovirus (CMV), and a completely unrelated RNA virus, Semliki Forest Virus (SFV). None of the three proteins which enhanced HSV-1 replication upon knockdown had an effect on either VZV or CMV, and one (NR3C2) was even inhibitory for SFV (\nFigure 2c\n). Of the 64 siRNAs which inhibited HSV-1, 27 (42.2%) were also inhibitory for VZV, 60 for CMV (93.8%) and 23 (35.9%) for SFV replication (Table S7 in Text S2). Some functional groups (transcriptional regulators) were required by most viruses, but there were notable differences between other proteins. For example IFITM-1, previously identified as an inhibitor of Influenza A, Dengue virus and WNV [10], inhibited VZV yet had a positive effect on HSV-1 replication. These data suggest that whilst there are some HFs which are broad in their effects on virus replication, a large proportion are species-specific.",

Pathways included those involved in gene expression, transcription, splicing and translational regulation (RNAi screen), and protein transport, cell cycle, and transcriptional repressor activity (Y2H screen). A combined analysis of HFs from both screens found dominant functional categories centred on the regulation of transcription (RNA polymerase II-associated genes, splicing factors, transcription activation and the Mediator complex) (Figure S3c, d). The physiological relevance of some HFs and pathways was confirmed by further biological validation. Protein transport pathways (in the form of dynein microtubule networks) are exploited by HSV-1 early after infection to shuttle viral capsids to the nucleus. These screens confirmed known interactions between dynein subunits and viral proteins, and identified additional previously unknown interactions (Text S1 and\nFigure S4a). Several dynein chain subunits were found to be essential for virus replication, whilst the moderate effect of depletion of other subunits demonstrated a level of functional redundancy in HSV-1 capsid transport (Figure S4b\u2013e) [38], [39]. Intrinsic anti-viral host defense mechanisms, in the context of cellular E2 ubiquitin ligases, were also investigated. The immediate-early viral protein ICP0, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is crucial for blocking anti-viral defense mechanisms by degrading promyeloctic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (ND10 domains) in the presence of cellular E2-ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s). Our siRNA screen found multiple E2s were required for this, and suggests that HSV-1 ICP0 is promiscuous in its exploitation of E2s to mediate PML degradation and ensure successful infection (Text S1 and Figure S5).",

            "text": "Combined bioinformatic analyses of protein interaction and siRNA depletion screens found a significant functional enrichment for proteins involved in transcription, and identified multi-protein complexes enriched for pro-viral HFs which strongly inhibited HSV-1 upon depletion, including the RNA-polymerase II, eIF3 and Mediator complexes (\nFigure 3a\n). The Mediator complex links the cellular transcription machinery (RNA polymerase II) to specific transcription factors, and the identification of many Mediator subunits as HFs in other viral siRNA depletion screens highlights its significant role in viral genome transcription [7], [9], [11], [40] (Table S2 in Text S2). Further, several Mediator subunits (Med25, 29, 17 and 8) are known to interact with the HSV-1 transactivator VP16 (UL48) and other herpesviral proteins [41] (Figure S6a). Consistently, the Mediator complex was found to be strongly required for HSV-1 replication, with depletion of the majority of subunits (Med 4, 6, 7, 8, 14, 16, 17, 21, 25, 26, 27 and 28) leading to a severe reduction in virus replication in the primary screen (Figure S6b) or in confirmatory deconvolution assays (\nFigure 3b\n). However, depletion of the Med23 subunit was striking in that it led to a significant enhancement of virus growth (\nFigure 3b\n). Flow cytometry quantification found that removal of Med23 not only increased the total number of infected cells (combination of GFPlo and GFPhi cells; 75.5% in comparison to 49.6% in mock-transfected cells) but also the copy number of virus genomes (GFPhi cells; 44.8% in comparison to 24.4% in mock-transfected cells) (\nFigure 3c\n). Gain-of-function experiments found overexpression of Med23 led to a corresponding inhibition of two strains of HSV-1 (\nFigure 3d\n\n; Figure S6c), confirming Med23 is a natural anti-viral component of the pro-viral Mediator complex. This anti-viral effect of Med23 was specific for HSV-1, as replication of VZV (\u03b1-herpesvirus), hCMV (\u03b2-herpesvirus), Vaccinia virus (DNA) and SFV (RNA virus) remained unaffected by Med23 depletion (\nFigure 3e\n).",

Since the Mediator complex and Med23 in particular is known to be involved in Jak/Stat-mediated interferon signaling [42], we used the lung epithelial cell line A549 and its Stat-1-deficient derivative A549-V [43] to determine if Med23 influences HSV-1 replication by modulating innate immunity. In the parental A549 cells the phenotype of HSV-1 replication was the same as that observed in Hela cells, where depletion of Med23 enhanced replication and over-expression inhibited virus growth. However, in the Stat1-deficient A549-V cells HSV-1 replication was unaffected by both depletion and over-expression of Med23 (\nFig. 4a\n), indicating that Med23 requires an intact Jak/Stat signalling pathway to exert its anti-viral effects.",

Whilst treatment with IFN-\u03b1, -\u03b2 and -\u03b3 significantly decreased HSV-1 replication levels, the observed \u223c2-fold enhancement of HSV-1 replication following Med23 depletion was still seen. However, pre-treatment with the both IFN-\u03bb1 and IFN-\u03bb2/3 blocked the enhancing effect of Med23 depletion (\nFigure 4b\n). Investigation into the effect of Med23 on interferon induction by qRT-PCR found that whilst Med23 over-expression induced IFN-\u03b2 (\u223c3-fold increase), induction of IFN-\u03bb1 and \u03bb2/3 was considerably and statistically significantly higher (\u223c26-fold induction; p = 0.003 and 0.002, respectively) (\nFigure 4c\n). This induction was specific, as levels of other cytokines and interferon-regulatory factors (IRFs) were unaffected by Med23 overexpression (Figure S7a). Secretion of IFN-\u03bb2/3 protein was also increased in all cell lines tested, but most significantly to \u223c11-fold in A549 cells (\nFigure 4d\n), which is consistent with a recent report showing that type III interferons are the dominant type of IFNs expressed by primary airway epithelial cells [44]. Furthermore, qPCR analysis found depletion of Med23 inhibited the induction of IFN-\u03bb expression following HSV-1 infection of A549 cells in comparison to cells transfected with the RSCF siRNA control (\nFigure 4e\n). Together, these data suggest that IFN-\u03bb is responsible for the observed inhibitory effect of Med23 on HSV-1 replication.",

Y2H and confirmatory co-immunoprecipitation experiments in mammalian cells with a panel of IRFs found that Med23 interacted with IRF4 and IRF7 (\nFigure 5a\n\n; Figure S7b). We also observed a weak interaction with IRF9, which may explain the previously observed effect of Med23 on Jak/Stat signalling [42]. To determine if this interaction had a functional effect, we looked at whether Med23 influenced IRF-mediated induction of IFN-\u03bb. In a luciferase reporter assay, neither IRF4 nor IRF9 led to a significant induction of the IFN-\u03bb1 promoter, either alone or in conjunction with Med23 (data not shown). IRF7 induced expression from the IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb1 promoters to similar levels (\u223c7-fold and 9-fold higher than background, respectively), whilst the ISRE, induced by IRF7 and also present in the IRF7 promoter, was induced \u223c15-fold (\nFigure 5b\n). Whilst co-expression of Med23 with IRF7 had no further effect on IFN-\u03b2 expression, a synergistic induction of the IFN-\u03bb1 promoter and, to a lesser extent, the ISRE, was observed (IFN-\u03bb1 doubled to \u223c18-fold, p = 0.02) (\nFigure 5b\n). Interestingly, a Med23 mutant unable to induce immediate early gene expression via jun/fos (R617Q, or R611Q in Med23 transcript variant 1 used here) synergistically induced ISRE expression with IRF7, yet was unable to further enhance IRF7-mediated induction of IFN-\u03bb1 (data not shown). A similar synergistic effect of Med23 and IRF7 was seen at the protein level, where co-expression increased supernatant levels of IFN-\u03bb3 more than 2-fold those seen with Med23 or IRF7 alone (Figure S7c, d).",

Furthermore, IFN-\u03bb expression is impaired in a cohort of ethnically Italian individuals suffering recurrent HSV-1-related herpes labialis reactivation [51]. To determine if the clinical severity of HSV-1 disease is due to the observed deficiency in IFN-\u03bb expression, we screened a subset of the recurrent herpes labialis (HL) cohort and additional subjects for the IFN-\u03bb3 promoter polymorphism. Genotypic analysis found the presence of a T (CT or TT genotype) had a dose-dependent association with clinical severity, with the homozygous TT genotype being more prevalent as disease severity increases (\nFigure 6\n). In spite of the relatively small sample numbers in some clinical categories (\nTable 1\n), the association of a CT or TT genotype with the most severe recurrence of herpes labialis (H+) was statistically significant (p = 0.014; Fishers's exact t-test). As the CC genotype is directly associated with increased IFN-\u03bb3 levels [51], these data highlight a previously unknown association between the frequency/severity of recurrence of herpes labialis, the CT/TT genotype and subsequent reduction in secretion of IFN-\u03bb3. It is of importance to investigate this genotype association with a larger cohort of HL patients, as well as those suffering with other HSV-1-related disease, in order to determine the role of IFN-\u03bb in the full spectrum of HSV-1 pathogenesis.",

Similarly, Y2H protein interaction screens can generate both false-positive interactions, due to \u2018sticky\u2019 proteins and auto-activation of the reporter gene used, and false-negative interactions. Whereas the number of false positives can be considerably reduced by stringent screening and selection criteria, the low sensitivity of the Y2H assay, which detects 20\u201330% of known interactions, is inherent to the system and can only be marginally improved. This poor sensitivity is caused by factors such as structural restraints of the Y2H bait and prey fusion proteins, a lack of or existence of distinct protein modification in yeast cells, and cellular localization signals in bait and prey proteins preventing nuclear import [52]. However, as all other high-throughput methods for measuring binary protein interactions possess a similarly low sensitivity, but are considerably more laborious and expensive, the Y2H system is still the most commonly used technology [53].",

Incoming HSV-1 capsids are transported to nuclear pores via the microtubule-organizing centre (MTOC), mediated by capsid proteins VP26 (UL35) and UL46 binding to the dynein light chains DYNLT1 (Tctex1) and DYNLT3 (rp3) [54], [55].

Combined with the siRNA screen data, which found depletion of multiple light chain subunits had moderate anti-viral effects on HSV-1, these data confirm propositions of redundancy in the capsid transport process which ensures successful infection in the event of viral mutations [38], [39], and provide further evidence that HSV-1 has evolved to be highly promiscuous in its exploitation of cellular pathways to its advantage.",

As the requirement of Mediator subunits in the replication of herpes and other viruses is already well-known [7], [9], [11], [41], it was striking that depletion of the Med23 subunit exerted the opposite phenotype and led to a strong increase in virus growth. The Mediator is composed of four distinct modules termed the head, middle, tail and kinase domains, which provide the Mediator with some degree of active control over transcription [59]. As individual subunits of this large complex interact with and exert functional effects via specific transcription factors, it is not unexpected that the observed anti-viral effects were specific to Med23 [60]. Within the Mediator, Med23 forms a tight sub-complex with Med24 and Med16 [60], [61]. The increase in virus replication observed upon depletion of Med24 may be caused by the destabilisation of the structure of this sub-complex (Figure S6b).",

This induction was mediated via a direct interaction with the transcription factor IRF7, which resulted in a synergistic increase in IFN-\u03bb expression. Med23 was unable, however, to further enhance IRF7-induced levels of IFN-\u03b2, suggesting an additional level of complexity to the regulation of interferon signalling. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of Med23 was specific to HSV-1, with replication of a range of other viruses including Vaccinia virus and Semliki Forest Virus being unaffected by Med23 depletion. As Vaccinia virus is resistant to IFN-\u03bb anti-viral activity [62], this observation further highlights the importance of IFN-\u03bb, as opposed to IFN-\u03b2, in the anti-viral effect of Med23. The R617Q mutation in Med23 (R611Q in Med23 transcript variant 1, used here) was unable to enhance IRF7-induced IFN-\u03bb expression. This mutation causes hereditary dementia [63], and the failure to induce IFN-\u03bb and thereby control HSV-1 in the brain may be a potential cofactor for the development of dementia, similar to Alzheimer's disease [64].",

            "text": "HSV infection controlled by a complex, interconnected and highly regulated network of cytokines expressed by innate immune cells. Type I IFNs mainly produced by HSV-infected keratinocytes [68] and pDCs [69] inhibit the spread from neurons to epithelial cells and between epithelial cells [70], similar to IFN-\u03b3. Type III IFNs are also able to directly inhibit HSV-1 infection in primary neurons, astrocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells [71], [72]. IFN-\u03b3 levels produced by peripheral blood CD4+ T-cells correlate with the frequency of HSV-1 reactivation [73]. IFN-\u03bb is able to induce expression of both itself and the type I IFNs, and a similar effect has also been observed for type I IFNs which induce both type I and III IFNs [71], [72]. Type III IFNs are mainly expressed by myeloid dendritic cells (mDC) and monocyte-derived macrophages [74], and signal through the heterodimeric IL10RB/IL28RA receptor complex whose expression is largely restricted to cells of epithelial origin and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), in contrast to the broadly expressed type I IFN receptor (IFN-\u03b1R1/2) [75], [76]. Since primary HSV-1 infection and reactivation affects skin and mucosa in the majority of cases, IFN-\u03bb may play a much greater role in the control of HSV-1 pathogenesis, likely in a complex network of coregulated type I and II IFNS, than previously thought. We hypothesize that HSV-infected DCs at the site of the lesion (such as skin Langerhans DCs whose role in IFN-\u03bb production is currently unknown, or intruding myeloid DCs) in individuals with the rs12979860 T/T or C/T haplotype express reduced levels of type III IFNs, and, in consequence, of type I IFNs, which leads to a reduced inhibition of local HSV-1 replication and the occurrence of fresh skin lesions. However, the relative contribution of IFN-\u03bb1 and \u03bb2/3 to the interferon-mediated control of HSV-1 replication in vivo, and indeed the role of Med23 in this, remains to be seen.",

Virus replication slopes during the linear phase were calculated and normalized to mock-transfected cells.

Replication slopes were calculated and normalized as described, and compared to the primary screen slope (1\u00b0). A heat map of replication slopes was generated where red represents inhibition (replication slope <0.5) and green represents enhancement (slope >1).
