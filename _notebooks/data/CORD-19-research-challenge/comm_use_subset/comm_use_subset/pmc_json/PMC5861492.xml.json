Novel strategies that target molecular pathways for high product yield and consistency are vital. To overcome this bottleneck, we developed a CRISPR-dCas based synthetic transcription factors (sTF) system that modulates expression of endogenous mRNA and miRNA targets involved in protein transport and glycosylation.",

To lower galactosyltransferase (\u03b21,4-GalT)-associated miRNA expression (cgr-miR-181d-5p, cgr-miR500 & cgr-miR501-5p), CHO cells were co-expressed with dCas9 and sgRNAs against miRNA promoters; or with native Cas9 and sgRNAs against mature miRNA sequences [1]. mRNA and miRNA levels of target genes were quantified by q-rt-PCR, protein level of \u03b21,4-GalTs by western blot, and secreted IgG yield by IgG-ELISA.",

While repressing Vamp4 transcription leads to a negative effect on IgG yield (Fig. 1b - c). Our results show positive correlation between pathways involved in protein transport and recycling, and recombinant protein (rProtein) yield. Both Cas9 and dCas9 approaches reduce miR-181d-5p, miR500 & miR501-5p by around 35-50%, this simultaneously enhances \u03b21,4-GalT1 & 4 expression by up to 2-fold, which could be useful in future engineering of rProtein glycosylation profiles for specific function. This system also provides a platform for concurrent manipulation of multiple mRNA and miRNA with dCas9, where dCas9 expression can be further controlled via AID- or ecDFR-Degron technology [2].",

Among the process related impurities such as host cell proteins (HCPs) or DNA the potential impact of lipids production and release during cell culture is still poorly understood due to the complex nature and diversity of this class of molecules. Thanks to recent advances in analytical tools especially mass spectrometry, the advent of lipidomics offers now the feasibility to study several thousands of lipid species thus unraveling the possibility to understand and potentially control the interactions between high performance bioreactor processes, harvest conditions and purification.",

At the metabolic level, these findings suggest a relative overflow of the carbon metabolism. From a process development perspective these findings can be considered on the one hand as a resource waste since the stored energy is not used for protein/biomass biosynthesis and on the second hand as the root cause of additional process challenges especially during the harvest and the first capture steps given the hydrophobic nature of these molecules. Implementation of lipidomics analysis enables us to highlight a new type of process variability and to anticipate potential problems for the downstream steps. The application of this methodology on our platform has helped us to design tailor made solutions (pretreatment selection, filter selection,\u2026) at the clarification step which are now implemented in our harvest development platform approach.",

Genedata Bioprocess, which was developed in collaboration with top pharmaceutical companies, can flexibly support various (non-linear) workflows and structure the collected information in a way that fosters collaboration across an organization. While increasing throughput is crucial to ensure the timely availability of optimal producer cell lines, high-throughput is only possible when automated processes in the laboratory and the resulting data collection and aggregation can be streamlined. Genedata Bioprocess helps to establish more productive processes by offering support and integration for automation stations and measurement devices. Thanks to the comprehensive workflow support and the possibility to integrate results from cell line stability experiments, product quality assessment, and bioreactor suitability tests, Genedata Bioprocess provides a unique way to evaluate cell lines. Comprehensive analysis of all data collected in the process helps to ensure the highest possible quality and minimize the time and resources needed for data analysis and management. Integration of bioreactor data analysis and visualization with other parameters measured in cell line development, streamlines clone evaluation in micro-bioreactors and supports high-throughput operations. Genedata Bioprocess comprehensively tracks the full clone history from the origin of the host cell line to the generation of the validated monoclonal producer cell line. For promising clones, the clone history report can be generated with one click. Besides supporting cell line development, Genedata Bioprocess is a comprehensive platform capable of tracking the complete bioprocess development process.",

Since common cancer treatment is limited and not effective for late stage carcinoma, alternative methods are needed to reduce the high mortality rate of cancer patients. One alternative approach is the application of the oncolytic Measles virus (OMV), because OMV has a natural affinity against cancer cells. The major drawbacks of OMV is to produce the extremely high amount of at least 1011 TCID50 (50 % tissue culture infective dose) per dose [2] which is needed. To solve this problem, a high titer process must be established including an efficient downstream processing (DSP). We developed an appropriate upstream processing and are able to produce 1010-1011 TCID50 mL-1 in a bioreactor with 0.5 L working volume [3]. Now, we focus on the DSP part. The following study tested the application of charged depth filters for the OMV clarification. In contrast to common DSP schemes, a depletion of virus particles or a loss of infectivity is not desired. The aim is a reduction of protein content and DNA with minimal loss of infective OMV. Further, we investigated the influence of the cell culture medium on the depth filtration process.",

Residual protein could pass the depth filter almost unhindered, whereas the hcDNA content was already reduced to 42% at maximum. However, the OMV titer was also reduced by the depth filtration. This undesired effect was stronger for the OMV present in SFM. Because the agencies require avoiding serum in clinical-grade production processes, this is disadvantageous. Nonetheless, because SFM will be soon standard for OMV production, further experiments have to be done preventing the OMV reduction during clarification. One option can be to reduce the adsorption strength of the virus to the filter material by the addition of salt. Moreover, it is important to establish a standardized protocol for the upstream processing. We determined batch-to-batch variations within the clarification indicating a strong impact of upstream processing (USP) on the outcome of the DSP. Therefore, further studies must investigate the influence of USP parameter e.g. time of harvest and pH of the harvest solution on the OMV.",

Furthermore, GSEA revealed several significantly enriched set of genes related to gene transcription, DNA replication and repair, cell growth and proliferation, as well as inhibition of apoptosis in feed-spiked cultures. Thus, feed-spiking increased the proliferative activity of cultivated cells. Several of the identified genes appear as promising targets for cell line engineering, but have not yet been described in relation to high-producing recombinant cell lines and will need to be evaluated in future studies.",

In this study, rounds of upstream and downstream processes were run to reach the CQA limits of the originator molecule. After conducting many different development strategies, the mirror plot images of the intact deconvoluted mass were found to be identical corresponding to similar levels of glycoforms. The UV chromatogram of reversed phase ultra-performance liquid chromatography (RP-UPLC) of tryptic peptide mapping demonstrated that the primary structure of TUR01 is identical to the originator as shown in Fig. 1a. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as oxidation, deamidation, N-terminal pyroglutamic acid, C-terminal lysine truncation levels were also comparable for two products. The glycosylation site (HC-Asn301) was confirmed by peptide mapping analysis and 100% glycan site occupancy was proven for TUR01 and originator. The glycosylation pattern for two products were highly similar in terms of major glycans (G0F, G1F, G0F-GN and etc.). Man5 level was lower in TUR01 compared to the originator product which may not have any clinical effect on the molecule. The secondary structure was determined by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. Absorption bands (Amide I and Amide II) were overlapped completely and amounts of \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-sheet structures were comparable. Furthermore; size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis revealed that both products have the same level of purity (>99%) and aggregate (<1%) levels. The level of impurities were determined as below 4% by CE-SDS. The capillary isoelectric focusing (cIEF) experiments showed that the charge variant profiles of two products are indistinguishable and the isoelectric point of main peak is observed at 8.3 for both products. The association/dissociation rate constants and binding affinity for both TUR01 and originator were highly similar and similarity score was calculated greater than 99%, as shown in Fig. 1b.",

In order to increase the throughput of our perfusion media development capabilities we sought to develop a small scale model of perfusion using the ambr\u00ae15 instrument (Sartorius, Germany). We used a modified cell settling model from the previously published by Kreye et. al. to achieve the cell retention necessary to reach perfusion relevant viable cell concentrations [1]. In this work, we will show the application of this small scale model for: (1) Identification of specific productivity performance over a steady-state for tested media, (2) Identification of CSPRmin for a specific cell line and medium combination, and (3) Confirmation of consistent product quality profiles between the small scale model and benchtop perfusion (data not shown).",

Even though high yielding, robust processes are the cornerstones of any process development, product quality parameters such as structural integrity, charge variances and post-translational modifications are progressively becoming the focus of the developmental work. In conjunction with host cell line selection and process performance parameters, media components are crucial for the continued progress in rational modulation of product quality attributes affecting biological activity, immunogenicity, half-life or stability. Among media components, trace elements (TE) are of particular interest as they play a pivotal role in various cell metabolism pathways. Based on a comprehensive DOE approach, extensive process performance- and product quality evaluation combined with metabolic flux analysis, the impact of several trace elements on the biopharmaceutical process is assessed.",

Its high repeatability is also a key parameters in the effort to narrow batch to batch deviations. In addition we demonstrate that this technique is potentially powerful for in-line and continuous monitoring of a lab bioreactor. We envision Lensless Imaging to become the future method of choice for on-line and in-situ monitoring of suspension cells and a perfect tool for process control in fed-batch or perfusion mode in single-use bioreactors or traditional steam sterilized vessels.

Transient gene expression offers a rapid approach to the production of numerous recombinant proteins for the initial-stage developments of biologics. Mammalian cells are major host cells for transient gene expression, but they have the disadvantages of complicated operations and high cost of culture. Insect cells are easy to handle and can be grown to a high cell density in suspension with a serum-free medium. Insect cells can also produce large amount of recombinant proteins through post-translational processing and modifications of higher eukaryotes. Hence, insect cells have been recognized as an excellent platform for the production of functional recombinant proteins [1,2].

This value was compared to the CSPR obtained during the 4th set-point (SP4) of the perfusion runs. As expected, the bleed fraction decreased when the capacitance set-point was increased and went down to 5% or less of the total perfusion rate (data not shown). Since the bleed removes the excess biomass, it is an indication of how close to a limitation the system is. Therefore, the CSPR calculated at SP4 was considered as the minimum CSPR. The CSPRmin obtained in both systems were very close (Table 1). The semi-continuous system can therefore be used to identify the CSPRmin before running a continuous bioreactor, it therefore facilitates the decision making early in the development (to define the target cell density for a defined perfusion rate).",

Galactose is a key sugar of interest due to its significant impact on Ab function and the ability to control galactosylation through cell culture medium. Herein, Irvine Scientific assessed the ability of media components to modulate galactose levels on a model therapeutic Ab. Various media compositions were able to modulate galactosylation levels without compromising cell growth and Ab titers. In addition, an in vitro assay was utilized to evaluate the functional ability of Abs to bind and activate complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). Differences in galactosylation significantly altered the Abs\u2019 ability to induce cell cytotoxicity. Furthermore, design of experiment analysis determined the optimal ratio of supplements to maximize galactosylation.

Furthermore, increased process understanding have evolved from the Process Analytical Tool initiative (PAT) and the Quality by Design (QbD) methodology. In contrast to one-factor-at-a-time methods, statistical Design of Experiment (DoE) methods are widely used to develop biopharmaceutical processes. Even if high-throughput systems can handle these numbers of experiments in parallel, the heuristic restriction of boundaries and the high number of factors results in stepwise iterations with multiple runs. Therefore, the combination of model-based simulations with DoE methods (mDoE) for the development of sophisticated cell culture processes is a novel tool for process development [1]. It is used to reduce the number of experiments during DoE and the time needed for the development of more knowledge-based cell culture processes. This concept was applied to the optimization of the initial glutamine and glucose concentrations of a CHO batch process.",

(Fig. 1).Cation exchange chromatography: CEx allows higher capacities (>100 g/L) than protein A, whilst being more affordable (from 2- to 6-fold cheaper). Low residual HCP (<500 ppm) was observed with all CEx resins tested. Without harvest treatment and clarification preceding the capture studies (either affinity or CEx), results showed a lower binding capacity of the resin, a higher content of HCP in the eluate (up to 2000 ppm), a higher content of HMW species in the elution fraction (up to 3-fold higher) and a significant turbidity of the neutralized eluate.Continuous multicolumn chromatography: Further options to increase cost efficiency include using a continuous multicolumn setup (Table 1).

Cultivated under standard conditions (37\u00b0C, pH 7) IgM012 is produced as 90% pentamers, whereas IgM012_GL only consists of approximately 80% pentamers.

A special focus is on the analysis of data from micro- and bench-top bioreactors (such as the ambr15\u2122 and DasGip\u2122 systems) operated in parallel. These bioreactors allow for increased throughput of clone selection and process optimization studies, which in turn leads to an increase in data generation. Genedata Bioprocess supports integration with such systems and enables a comparison of data regardless of the instrument provider or scale. Automated bioreactor data analysis allows development groups to take advantage of even richer datasets and, as data management is built-in to the system, the data can be easily tracked and associated to historical records. Another focus is on cross-reactor scale comparisons. Data coming from different bioreactor scales can be easily imported into the platform and analyzed to establish the best conditions for upscaling. Genedata Bioprocess enables the correlation of process parameters (e.g., fermentation protocols, media recipes, bioreactor control parameters), with key performance indicators of the processes (e.g., Titer, qP) and the product quality attributes (e.g., aggregation, glycosylation profiles). Finally, bioreactor time course data can be tracked together with clone analytics and product quality parameters, which makes the platform uniquely able to support end-to-end biopharma development.",

To increase efficiency in R&D processes and reduce costs, organizations need to evaluate potential drug candidates earlier in the R&D process, eliminate those with undesirable characteristics, and focus on the most promising candidates. After designing and thorough testing of successful candidates, efficient production of new biological entities in mammalian cell lines is necessary. The main goal here is to find a suitable cell line and optimal upstream and downstream processing conditions that not only lead to a satisfactory product yield, but also to a product with the desired biochemical properties. The evaluation of production cell lines, processes, and product quality attributes is performed earlier and in higher throughput for an increasing number of drug candidates.

We show how the analytical data generated in the course of a developability assessment are compiled to select the best drug candidate (Fig. 1b). Implemented traffic-light systems indicate where molecules harbor issues such as in case of the antibody TPP-86, which is compromised by low temperature and repeated freeze-thaw operations. The same assessment views can also be applied on batches and cell lines. The underlying data can be visualized graphically. As an example, we show glycan types of products obtained from different cell line clones generated in a cell line development campaign for the molecule TPP-86 (Fig. 1c). Even though the selected clone CLI-35 meets the glycosylation criteria (e. g., <13% afucosylation, <40% galactosylation, <2% sialylation), the produced molecule harbors some stability issues as mentioned above. Therefore, more attempts would be needed either in formulation or in reengineering of the complimentarity determining regions (CDRs) in order to provide a developable TTP-86-like drug candidate.",

Model of online estimation of \u03bc was developed from cultures in batch mode, and was validated by comparing online estimated \u03bc with the experimental ones calculated at the end of the culture. With this model, the moment when \u03bc started to decrease significantly, which indicated that cells were no longer in the exponential growth phase, was identified as the critical moment. To demonstrate the interest of online estimation of \u03bc, the developed model was applied to a feed-harvest culture, where the medium renewals were performed at the critical moments indicated by the model. This culture was then compared with the traditional feed-harvest culture where medium renewals were performed by following offline measurements of glucose and glutamine. We found that the online strategy allowed to maintain the value of \u03bc by renewing the medium at the right time, while the values of \u03bc varied a lot when using offline strategy. Moreover, by using the online estimation of \u03bc, the glycosylation of IgG was kept at a high level (about 95%) throughout the whole culture. However, for the culture using offline strategy, the glycosylation level decreased progressively and was only about 75% at the end of the culture (Fig. 1).",

The latter reaction produced equimolar quantities of monosialylated and disialylated Cetuximab and polyclonal antibodies. The results suggest that for human antibodies (150 kDa) there may be a limitation for sialylation given the steric constraints between the two CH2 domains of the dimeric structure. The ability to sialylate the smaller camelid antibody (80 kDa) was greater resulting in a high (>90%) level of disialylated glycans. This suggests that the steric constraints for glycosylation may be lower. These sialylated antibodies have significant potential clinical importance for their ant-inflammatory activities.",

This enables repeated rounds of an enzymatic reaction or sequential reaction steps without the need for intermediate antibody purification. The antibody can be removed eventually from the column by application of an elution buffer once all desired glycan modification have been made. Since affinity ligand purification of antibodies is performed routinely as an initial step of purification after cell culture, the glycan modification can easily be incorporated into this process.

This is mainly because microvesicles can be enriched/deprived for specific proteins, based on their functional purpose and their cellular origin. Recently, microvesicles purified from the supernatant of T24 bladder cancer cells were reported to be enriched for Bcl-2 and cyclin D1 (anti-apoptotic proteins), but deprived for Bax and caspase-3 proteins (pro-apoptotic proteins) contributing towards immunity against programmed cell-death [2].

Quality of different fractions was ensured using Western blotting for exosomal marker, CD63 (SC-15363) and coomassie stained gel for loading control (Fig. 1a). To evaluate impact on cell growth, cells were seeded with microvesicles and microvesicle-free fraction collected from log-phase of culture and cell counts were performed by ViCell using trypan-blue dye exclusion method. For impact on productivity, cell-free supernatant, collected from microvesicle-treated human IgG secreting CHO culture from stationary-phase of culture with respective control, was evaluated using ELISA (ab100547). Microvesicles collected from 10% of media (by volume) from routine maintenance cultures compared to working volume for microvesicle-supplementation were used in each experiment.",

However, microvesicle-free fraction did not had significant impact on growth. The viability of microvesicle-supplemented cultures, similar to microvesicle-free media supplemented, was also higher compared to standard culture suggesting potential use of microvesicles for regulating CHO growth in production cultures. This could be possibily because microvesicles have already been reported to be enriched with cell growth/death-regulating proteins and hence facilitating cell growth [2,3]. We have also observed abundance of cell cycle regulators including cyclin D1 in microvesicle-fraction compared to microvesicle-free spent-media in our laboratory (data not shown); however, further investigation are required to prove the hypothesis. The overall productivity of human IgG secreting CHO cells was also observed to increase by ~4 fold following supplementation of microvesicles to the culture without significantly affecting per-cell productivity. Since microvesicle-supplementation facilitates cell growth, increased number of viable producer cells in the culture could be expected to be the basis of observed increase in the overall productivity of the culture [2,3]. The further work is ongoing to in-depth explore the potential of microvesicles for improving recombinant protein production from CHO cells.",

While experiments in plain shake flasks did not show any differences in growth, cultivations under elevated shear stress in baffled shake flasks resulted in lower peak viable cell densities with Kolliphor\u00ae P188 and some Pluronic\u00ae F-68 lots. It remaines unclear whether this can be explained by different membrane protective activities alone, or if other mechanisms, occuring during and after cellular uptake, contribute to this effect. Especially for the tested lots of Pluronic\u00ae F-68, SEC of surfactants showed differences in the low molecular weight fraction. This fraction mainly represents polyethylen oxide (PEO) (revealed by NMR), which is likely to be a remnant from synthesis. These observations indicate that the use of different poloxamers and lots thereof should be carefully evaluated, especially under elevated shear stress. Further experiments will focus on investigating distinct SEC fractions of poloxamers.",

Aurintricarboxylic acid (endonuclease inhibitor; enhancer used in e.g. salivary gland transfection) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (polymer; beneficial in electroporation) were both found to negatively impact PEI-mediated transfection of CHO cells, while another tested polymer enhanced growth as well as transfection efficiency.

Based on the results of the independent substance testings, the medium formulation was modified by the addition of a weak chelator and further components including vitamins.

For instance, the specific power input [P/V] of 30 W/m3 might result in a good agitation in production scale whereas it leads to a non-turbulent mixing behavior in process development scale. To overcome this issue a new approach for an easy scaling procedure was developed.

Significant advantages, such as great mechanical stability, good biocompatibility and good mass transfer properties characterized these capsules based on sodium cellulose sulfate/poly(diallyldimethyl) ammonium chloride (SCS/PDADMAC) [1, 2].

            "text": "Cells mixed in the cellulose sulfate solution under physiological conditions can be safely trapped within a liquid core during capsule formation. Encapsulated cells can reached cell densities \u2264 40 x 106 cells mLcapsule-1, whereas cells confined in alginate/PLL beads and non-encapsulated ones reached 11.3 x 106 cells mLbead-1 and 2.4 x 106 cells mL, respectively. One major advantage of these polyelectrolyte microcapsules (<1 mm) is the low MWCO (<10 kDa) (Fig. 1a-b). This restricted permeability allows for a conditioning of the capsule core by autocrine factors, which in turn permits the use of basal cell culture medium instead of expensive T cell specialized media, hence does not necessitate high amounts of rhIL-2 and reduces the cultivation costs. Moreover, co-encapsulation of rhIL-2 had a beneficial effect on the growth kinetics in most cases (Fig. 1c). Some evidence is presented that the SCS used to form the polyelectrolyte microcapsules, specifically adsorbs IL-2 (Table 1) \u2013 A cytokine which provides an essential signal for T-cell proliferation and differentiation [3]. Therefore, we postulate that the SCS used for encapsulation has biomimetic properties, creating an artificial extracellular matrix mimicking heparin sulfate which in turn positively affect T cell proliferation via trans-presentation of IL-2 (Fig. 1d) [4].",

            "text": "Primary T lymphocytes can be expanded under appropriate conditions outside the body. In the latter, T cells grow/expand in specific environments where the cells are tightly packed, leading to multiple cell\u2013cell contacts and manifold interactions with the extracellular matrix. Ex vivo suspension cultures of diluted cells cannot provide such a microenvironment. In the microcapsules-based cultivation system presented, the cells are suspended in a viscous SCS-solution. The low molecular weight cut off of the surrounding polyelectrolyte membrane assures that typical signaling molecules produced by the cells are retained thus facilitates the \u201cconditioning\u201d of the cellular microenvironment, while nutrients and metabolites can pass. Expensive additives, such as interleukin-2 (IL-2), can be co-encapsulated. Expansion then no longer requires specialized T-cell media. Moreover, the SCS seems to have biomimetic properties, representing an artificial extracellular matrix mimicking heparin sulfate. We consider that the described method may be an appropriate alternative to expand T cells while creating a local microenvironment mimicking in vivo conditions.",

Due to this event, several genes encoded at the left terminus have been deleted whereas the gene dosis of those originally encoded only at the right terminus may have increased. We do not currently know how much the various point mutations and changes in genomic structure combine to explain the improved replication of MVA-CR19.

With this promoter, we were able to generate stable CHO pools capable of producing high levels of a Fc fusion protein (900 mg/L), outperforming by 3 to 4 fold those generated with CMV5 and hybrid EF1\u03b1-HTLV constitutive promoters. Besides the strength of the CR5 promoter, we demonstrated that the ability to control both the time and the level of expression during pool generation and maintenance gave a real advantage to the inducible expression system. Indeed, we observed that keeping the expression OFF during selection enabled the generation of pools with superior productivity compared with the pools whose expression was maintained ON. Moreover, preliminary results suggest that keeping recombinant protein expression down increases the frequency of high producer clones [2].",

On day of the experiment, the cells were centrifuged and stained with DyLight 650 conjugated Protein A. Subsequently, cells were washed, resuspended in PBS, filtered through a FACS tube with cell strainer cap and analyzed by flow cytometry. The top 3\u20135 % population with regard to DyLight 650 fluorescence was selected and FACS droplets were sorted into 384-well flat bottom plates containing cloning medium. Doublet discrimination was done by using a FCS-W/FCS-H dot plot, and a SSC-W/SSC-H dot plot. Immediately after single cell cloning into 384-well plates (1 cell/well) the plates were centrifuged followed by imaging using the Cellavista (day 0).

Other considerations include ease of cloning, stability for propagation in E. coli as well as in the mammalian host cell line, and ease of sequence amplification for verification of vector construction and for detection of insertion site and copy number in stably expressing cells. For these reasons, use of the same promoters and polyA tails in dual cassette vectors, as is common for expression of the heavy and light chains of monoclonal antibodies, can be problematic. In order to minimize sequence similarities between the two expression cassettes, we have modified the promoters, introns, and polyA tails of the light chain and heavy chain expression cassettes in the dual expression vector commonly used for the expression of therapeutic antibodies in the CHOZN\u00ae GS-/- cell line development platform.",

Analysis of GFP and RFP expression from the modified vectors indicated relatively high expression from the RFP/HC expression cassette of vector #37. A stronger promoter resulting in overabundance of HC, known to be toxic to cells, provides a possible explanation for the poor results with this vector. Interestingly, swapping the positions of the LC and HC in #37 resulted in a vector, #77, that out-performed the initially identified lead vector (Fig. 1). This same change was made to vector #39 without any resulting improvement in titers (vector #78, Fig. 1). Interestingly, vector #39 had a smaller difference in relative promoter strengths, based on mean channel fluorescence ratio of GFP to RFP, suggesting that overabundance of HC was not an impediment to IgG1 expression from #39. Poor titers were also seen with a modified version of vector #39 (vector #79, Fig. 1) in which the glutamine synthethase selection cassette was in the reverse orientation. This second screen identified vector #77 as the lead vector design (Fig. 1). A full comparative study of vector #77 and the control vector was performed, cumulating in the generation and comparison of single-cell clones from each. These studies have demonstrated the equivalence of these vectors in terms of IgG1 titer.",

From a range of nine conditioned media samples; four compelling products have been identified which improve low-cell density growth of CHO-K1 cells, compared to SFM-II control media. We feel that these early-stage conditioned media products may increase cloning efficiencies during upstream CHO cell line development, resulting in financial savings for industry and increasing the possibilities of identifying particularly high-performing transformed clones.",

Achieving high level of recombinant protein production by these cell lines still remains a challenge. In order to understand the potential roles of lipids in protein production, secretion, vesicular transport and energy metabolism, we coupled high-throughput transcriptomics and lipidomics technologies. Quantitative lipidomics is an emerging \u2018omics technology which can help us understand the physiological limitations of each cell line. The two types of major lipid groups in cells are non-polar and polar lipids. Polar lipids such as glycerophospholipids (PLs) include phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and phosphatidic acid (PA). In this study; we integrated two dimensional high performance thin layer chromatography (2D-HPTLC) and mass spectrometry (MS) lipid analysis of SP2/0, CHO, and HEK cell lines to understand the major differences in the lipid content of these hosts.",

To understand these metabolic differences, transcriptomics analysis using Illumina HighSeq and Gene Expression Omnibus was conducted on these mammalian cells. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database was used to map the transcriptomics data to the lipid synthetic pathways. Transcriptomics data mapping to KEGG pathways demonstrated that differences in LPE and LPC pathways correlate with the expression profiles of secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2), lysophospholipid acyltransferase (LPEAT), lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT), and lysophospholipase (LYPLA) [1].",

The isolation of cell clones based on random single cell deposition via fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) provides a heterogeneous panel of expressers. We hypothesize that the application of FACS to provide an additional sorting step based on desirable cell attributes that correlate with productivity, product quality or cell growth attributes could lead to the isolation of higher producing cell lines with enhanced product quality attributes.",

In contrast, only phase 1 was observed in hybridoma cultures even when pH was non-controlled. FBA showed that TCA fluxes in phase 1 and phase 2 were similar, obtaining similar cell growth rate, but glucose uptake rate was much lower in phase 2 due to the lactate co-consumption. Some authors hypothesize that cells metabolize extracellular lactate as a strategy for pH detoxification [2]. Glucose and lactate co-metabolization resulted in a better-balanced cell metabolism, as can be seen from the metabolic fluxes calculated, with minor effects on cell growth. The observation of glucose and lactate co-consumption metabolic behavior and its deeper study and characterization could open the door of novel culturing strategies with the aim of increasing bioprocesses productivity.",

Although optimisation efforts have led to a vast increase in productivity, CHO cells yield less than other expression systems like yeast or bacteria [1]. To improve yields and find beneficial bioprocess phenotypes, genetic engineering plays an essential role in recent research. The miR-23 cluster with its genomic paralogues (miR-23a and miR-23b) was first identified as differentially expressed during temperature shift, suggesting its role in proliferation and productivity [2]. The common approach to deplete miRNAs is the use of a sponge decoy which, requires the introduction of reporter genes. As an alternative this work aims to knockdown miRNA expression using the recently developed CRISPR/Cas9 system which does not require a reporter transcript. This system consists of two main components: the single guide RNA (sgRNA) and an endonuclease (Cas9) which induces double strand breaks (DSBs).

The amounts of IgG both remaining in the cell and secreted into the medium at each time point were measured by quantitative western blotting. For immuno-fluorescent microscopy observation, cells were cultivated on coverslips with CHX for 4 h. Immunofluorescent staining against the recombinant IgG, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and Golgi apparatus was performed after chemical fixation.

Our work deals with humanization of murine mAb2/3H6. The superhumanization approach leads to a loss of binding affinity which was partially restored by a single human-to-mouse backmutation (T98hR). [1] This residue was selected by synergistic combination of sequence analyses of antibody framework regions and structural information using novel in silico simulations. For structural stabilization, a conglomeration of tyrosine residues surrounding T98hR was identified, the so called \u201ctyrosine cage\u201d. [2] Analysis of the \u201ctyrosine cage\u201d was done by alanine scanning mutations with a double mutation variant T98hR + Y27hA (BM09) and a triple mutation variant T98hR + Y27hA + Y32hA (BM10). In a recent series of experiments we tried to enhance binding affinity by three new variants with backmutations in the variable light chain (VL). Originating from T98hR, residues in the VL were selected based on their spatial proximity to the CDR3 loop of the variable heavy chain. Affinity improvement of T98hR was evaluated by VL-double backmutation variants T98hR + F46lL (SU01) and T98hR + Q49lS (SU02) and a triple backmutation variant T98hR + F46lL + Q49lS (SU03).",

Many cell engineering approaches, including gene introduction, knockout and knockdown, have been employed to enhance recombinant antibody production [1]. However, identifying production enhancer genes is the rate-limiting step for CHO cell engineering, because the conventional method requires a series of experiments including genomic integration of the tested genes, selection of stable cell clones and cell culture experiments of several clones. In this study, we propose an approach for rapid evaluation of production enhancer genes based on an episomal expression system.",

            "text": "We constructed four CHO cell lines stably expressing EBNA1, termed IgG1-EB01 to EB04. In capillary electrophoresis analysis, we observed a clear peak corresponding to the EBNA1 expression in all four cell lines. We tested the transfection efficiency by pOTC-GFP plasmids. In the best transfection condition, PEI/DNA ratio of 1/1, IgG1-EB01 cell showed the highest GFP-positive cell number (1.07\u00d7107 cell/mL) and transfection efficiency (95%) among the four cell lines. Therefore, IgG1-EB01 cell lines were selected for further study. After the transfection, the number of GFP-positive cells continued to increase even after the passage (Fig. 1), suggesting that the pOTC-GFP plasmid was stably retained and replicated by EBNA1/oriP system in IgG1-EB01 cell lines. In preliminary experiments, we introduced three genes, MDH2, GSS and GCLM, into IgG1-EB01 cell lines. Cotransfection of these three genes led to an increase in IgG1 production from 287\u00b118 mg/L (control) to 334\u00b121 mg/L at day 8 (P<0.05, t-test, n=3). This result suggests that these three genes work as production enhancer genes. Conventional methods based on stable cells take up to 6 months to determine whether the gene of interest is beneficial for recombinant IgG1 production. In contrast, identification of production enhancer genes is achievable within 10 days by our proposed method based on EBNA1/oriP system.",

In the Reference constructs (without 2GUN), the \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 chains were expressed from vectors with marker genes for zeocin, blasticidin, and GS, respectively. A similar 3 vector combination was also generated with 2GUN elements integrated in each vector. In addition, 2 vectors with 2 subunits (\u03b3-\u03b1 and \u03b1-\u03b3), each with a separate 2GUN element, promoter and poly-adenylation signal, were generated with a GS marker gene. CHO GS-/- cells were transfected with the 4 appropriate vector combinations in equimolar ratios and selected in bulk in medium lacking glutamine and 1 or 2 antibiotics. The 2-vector transfected cell pools recovered first, due to the presence of only 1 antibiotic in the medium (Fig. 1a). The pools transfected with three 2GUN vectors recovered to maximum viability just a few days after the 2-vector 2GUN pools. Recovery of the Reference pools took up to a week longer than the 2GUN pools. Production of each pool was assessed in a batch production run in shaker flasks. All 2-vector 2GUN pools which recovered first produced titers around 0.1 g/L, which is almost 10-fold higher as compared to the production by Reference pools (Fig. 1b). The highest titers of 0.5 g/L were obtained in the 3-vector 2GUN pools. These data show that the 2G UNic\u2122 genetic elements can be successfully used to obtain a significant increase in the titer of difficult-to-express proteins. Similar results have been obtained with other DTE proteins, including fc-fusion proteins and bi-specific antibodies (not shown).",

The predicted volume ratios, based on these diameters, are 2.24 (DG44-SC39:DG44-SC20) and 1.59 (IgG3-SC39:IgG3-SC20). The levels of \u03b2-actin and the products of most other genes that were detected by mRNA-seq differed by approximately 20% in the comparison between SC39 and SC20 (SC39 > SC20). Based on the analysis of gene expression levels per cell volume, approximately 90% of detected genes showed lower expression in both DG44-SC39 and IgG3-SC39 compared with the levels in DG44-SC20 and IgG3-SC20, respectively. In addition, the number of genes whose expression level was decreased in IgG3-SC39 compared with that in DG44-SC39 was larger than those showing the opposite pattern. The results of the comparisons between IgG3-SC20 and IgG3-SC39 indicate that differentially expressed genes were mainly related to cell growth (e.g. Myc, SMAD), apoptosis (e.g. Caspase), lipid metabolism (e.g. SREBP, PPAR\u03b3) and epigenetic histone modification (e.g. BRCA, HAT) pathways. The mRNA levels of Myc, SMAD, Caspase, BRCA and HAT related genes were lower in IgG3-SC39, while those of SREBP and PPAR\u03b3 related genes were higher in IgG3-SC39.

Since native hBMP2 is glycosylated, a cell-free system based on eukaryotic cell lysates is required for its production. CHO cell lysates were chosen, since they had previously been established as the most productive eukaryotic system in our hands [1], while concomitantly enabling a direct comparison to the production of hBMP2 in stable clones established in CHO-K1. The ability to perform post-translational modifications is a major advantage of eukaryotic systems. The CHO lysates prepared by the protocol used here have previously been shown to contain significant amounts of endogenous microsomes derived from the endoplasmatic reticulum during lysis [2]. To enforce translocation of the target protein into the microsomal structures, a melittin signal peptide was fused to the hBMP2 cDNA. The glycosylation of the protein was assessed by enzymatic treatment (PNGase, EndoH) and confirmed using 14C-mannose for the de novo protein synthesis. Upon cell-free protein synthesis, the hBMP2 yield was 100-fold higher than the best one in the HEK-293 cells. The difference becomes even more dramatic, when productivities are considered (Table 1), i.e. the fact that maximum product titers are reached within 3 h in the cell-free system compared to 120 h in the cell-based ones. This demonstrates that the cell-free expression system is most suitable compared to mammalian cell expression method for the production of glycosylated human BMP2 (Table 1) [3].",

            "text": "Human growth factors are complex molecules, which make their production in mammalian cells desirable. However, low product titers caused by a variety of both cell and process related effects may hinder the development of highly productive processes. In such cases, cell-free protein production using CHO cell lysates containing endogenous microsomes for post-translational processing, may eventually present an attractive alternative. In particular since these lysates can be used under tightly controlled conditions assuring a higher degree of reproducibility, than, e.g. transient transfection systems. Cell-free systems are known to circumvent typical bottlenecks of cell-based ones, e.g. metabolic regulation and cell maintenance mechanisms. In consequence, the production of a recombinant protein is neither inhibited by its accumulation nor by any interaction with the cells, e.g. through the activation of inhibitory signaling pathways.",

Significant increase in the levels of calreticulin was seen on treatment with tunicamycin (Fig. 1g). Both XBP1s and Grp78 were marginally induced when treated with 30ng/mL of tunicamycin in both CTE-and STE-cultures (Fig. 1h), and significantly up-regulated when treated with 500ng/mL of tunicamycin. The CHOP mRNA levels also increase with increasing tunicamycin concentrations, with levels in STE-cultures lower than CTE-cultures (Fig. 1h).

To construct antibody-producing CHO cells, exogenous genes encoding antibodies are usually integrated into unspecified regions of chromosomes (random integration). However, the chromatin structure differs depending on the location of the chromosomal region, which affects the expression level of the gene of interest [2]. Recently, gene-targeting methods that enable site-specific integration of expression vectors have been developed. However, the regions that are most efficient for exogenous gene expression have not been clarified. We previously constructed a CHO genomic bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library generated from the recombinant CHO-DG44 cell line. It was expected to cover the entire CHO genome five times. The 20 chromosomes in CHO-DG44 cells were aligned in decreasing order of size and assigned letters from A to T [3]. Three hundred and four BAC clones were mapped to every chromosome of CHO-DG44. Among the karyotypes of CHO-DG44, CHO-K1 and primary Chinese hamster cells, chromosomes A and B are considered as the sole paired chromosomes corresponding to chromosome 1 in primary Chinese hamster cells. Hence, chromosomes A and B are considered to be stable [4]. In this study, we constructed antibody-producing cells by using a gene-targeting method, which focused on the stable chromosomes.",

We previously established recombinant CHO cells (CHO/NE[scFv-Fc]\u00d71) expressing reporter (Neor and EGFP) and scFv-Fc proteins using Cre-IDRV produced by pQMSCV/NE[scFv-Fc] [2]. For the second Cre-RMCE reaction, we constructed a viral vector plasmid (pQMSCV/HD[scFv-Fc]) encoding marker genes (ATG-deleted Hygr/IRES/DsRed) and an scFv-Fc expression unit flanked with corresponding loxP sites. After the second round of Cre-mediated integration between circular retroviral DNA derived from IDRV and CHO/NE[scFv-Fc]\u00d71 cell genome, Neor expression was replaced with Hygr expression, and red fluorescent protein was expressed in the cells. The expected structures of the transgene after Cre-RMCE reaction between IDRV and cell genome are also shown in Fig. 1a. After CHO/NE[scFv-Fc]\u00d71 cells were infected with Cre-IDRV produced using pQMSCV/HD[scFv-Fc], two cell colonies were isolated using hygromycin screening (CHO/HD[scFv-Fc]\u00d72). The cells expressed DsRed (Fig. 1b). Genomic DNA extracted from the cells were subjected to PCR using specific primer pairs \u03b1 and \u03b2, and \u03b3 and \u03b4 to confirm site-specific integration. DNA fragments with expected sizes were amplified in each cell clone (Fig. 1c). These results indicate that site-specific repeated integration was achieved using Cre-IDRVs. In contrast, scFv-Fc productivity in CHO/HD[scFv-Fc]\u00d72 cells was slightly decreased compared with that of CHO/NE[scFv-Fc]\u00d71 (data not shown). Although the reason remains unclear, repeat-induced gene silencing might occur due to tandem repeat structure of expression units. We reported improved recombinant antibody production using a production enhancer element [4]. Such a cis-regulatory element might be a feasible approach to enhance the productivity.",

The recombinant baculovirus using an integrated EF1\u03b1 promoter to control GFP expression, described elsewhere [18], was diluted to the respective concentrations in the different surrounding fluids. After discarding the cultivation medium of the hMSC-TERT, 1 mL of virus containing solution was added to the cells. The following incubation was varied in duration before replacing the virus solution with growth medium and an incubation overnight. 24 h post transduction (hpt) the cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized with 100 \u03bcL Trypsin/EDTA and incubated for 5 min at 37\u00b0C. Trypsination was then stopped applying 100 \u03bcL soybean trypsin inhibitor and the cells were analyzed using flow cytometry.",

Obviously, a higher concentration of viral particles and longer incubation of cells with virus increases the probability for hits between cells and virus particles. Additionally, the surrounding fluid can have a negative impact on the transduction. This is due to the interaction of medium components with the baculovirus. Therefore, PBS containing Ca2+ & Mg2+ is recommended as surrounding fluid for transduction experiments. In Fig. 1B, the transduction conditions resulting in the highest percentage of GFP+ cells are displayed: 150 virus particles per cell (PPC) and an incubation time of 5 h with hMSC-TERT.",

Accordingly, there is an urgent need to design new and more effective drugs to treat breast cancer. Notch signaling is an evolutionary conserved cell-to-cell communication pathway crucial during embryonic and breast development and tissue homeostasis. This pathway is often hyper-activated by overexpression of Notch receptors and/or its ligands in several types of cancers, such as breast cancer (TNBC included), where it contributes to its development, progression and drug resistance [3], [4], [5].

Functional studies performed in human breast cancer MCF7 cells showed that both ligands are biologically active as they increased the expression of the Notch-dependent genes HES-1, HEY-L and HEY-1. Recombinant DLL1 and peptides were used to select for monoclonal antibodies by Phage Display. After three rounds of panning with DLL1 peptides we identified 13 scFv positive clones, 2 of which presented high affinity to DLL1-ECD-FC. Currently we are performing more phage display selections to increase the number of positive clones. scFv with higher affinities will be reformatted into IgGs and their ability to inhibit the Notch pathway will be evaluated. The anti-oncogenic effects of anti-DLL1 IgGs will be assessed in breast cancer cells in viability/apoptosis, proliferation, migration, and invasion assays.",

After improvement of transfections by the adjustment of DNA amounts in small scale experiments, AAV production was analyzed in shaker flasks. The batch process showed an expected increase in cell density with low variability between biological replicates (Fig. 1b). The genomic titer increased according to the viable cell density until day four where a sudden drop started. This observation was made for AAV productions in HEK-TF, HEK-GM and Freestyle F17 medium. For optimal yields, we assume that a slight decrease in viability marks the point in time for harvest. From optimized protocols, a batch process in a 2 l bioreactor was carried out. Interestingly the bioreactor cultivation resulted in lower overall viable cell densities but in higher genomic copies per cell compared to shaker flasks (Fig. 1c). These results are comparable to already published data for suspension cells [2]. Subsequent optimization of the bioreactor protocol will lead to further increase in rAAV yield.",

The height of the fixed-bed can be varied (2, 4 and 10 cm) as well as density of carrier packing (96 gm/L or 144 gm/L). The iCELLis system comes in two formats, the iCELLis Nano bioreactor (0.53-4.0 m2) and the iCELLis 500 bioreactor (66-500 m2).

Different classes of proteins were selected to evaluate the quality of the CHO CECF system including a transmembrane receptor, a single chain variable fragment and an ion channel. Cell-free protein synthesis was performed in the presence of 14C leucine for radio labeling of synthesized proteins. Protein yield was quantified by TCA precipitation of radio labeled proteins followed by scintillation measurement and molecular mass was detected by autoradiography.

Patients with high-titer/high-responding inhibitors must be treated with bypassing agents that can achieve hemostasis. Activated factor VII (FVIIa) is an attractive candidate for hemostasis, independent of FVIII/FIX, making this coagulation factor an alternative for hemophilia patients with inhibitory antibodies. However recombinant factor VII is produced in BHK-21 cells (Baby hamster kidney cells) and as well as the others coagulation factors, it may contain immunogenic epitopes [5 - 7].
