Potential causal relationships between periparturient metabolism and immune function have been examined in numerous studies (e.g., [3,7\u201313]). Various hypotheses have been put forward that attribute the impairment of immune functions around the time of calving to endocrine or metabolic changes that appear to be linked to the initiation of milk production and related to the mobilization of endogenous body reserves to enable milk production. For instance, high non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations observed in early lactation (e.g., [12]) are discussed to be associated with impaired lymphocyte proliferation and polymorphonuclear leukocyte functions [8,9,13]. Proliferation and IL4 secretion of peripheral blood mononuclear cells were found to be negatively correlated with the concentration of serum NEFA [8].",

The early lactating AC cows are in a physiological stage that is associated with metabolic changes due to the onset of lactation. In dairy cows, this stage is frequently associated with a shifting of the metabolism into a severe negative energy balance, as the energy demands for lactogenesis exceed energy intake (e.g., [28\u201330]). Coping with these considerable metabolic challenges associated with lactation is of first priority for cows in the early lactation period. It has been documented in several studies that this intense metabolic burden may have a negative impact on immune functions of cows in the periparturient period [4,7,9\u201311,31,32]. Wathes et al. [15] showed that global gene expression and immune response were altered in cows with severe negative energy balance and concluded that uterine involution and elimination of contaminant bacteria will be delayed in cows with negative energy balance post calving.",

The most significantly enriched GO terms in this cow group comprise a variety of biological processes included in the regulation of gene expression and protein biosynthesis, particularly mRNA translation, ribosome structure and expression. Furthermore, biological processes associated with mechanisms focusing on catabolic processes (nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, RNA catabolic process, macromolecular complex disassembly) and on biological processes involved in virus survival (viral life cycle, viral genome expression and transcription, viral infectious cycle) were found to be enriched in response to vaccination. A downregulation of translation in response to a viral attack was reported to operate against a number of viruses [39,40] in order to protect the individual against virus replication [41]. The host cell protein synthesis shut-off has been discussed as an antiviral protection pathway in our previous study [19].

The generally reduced transcriptional response in the AC cows is most probably ascribed to the fact that the priority of cows in the early lactation interval is to cope with physiological challenges due to physical recovery and reorganization events required postpartum and to metabolic stress due to the onset of lactation. Additional burden due to the intervention in the immune system by exposure to vaccination cannot be defended adequately in the AC cows compared to the BC cows. Thus, the results of our whole transcriptome analysis suggest that the immune defense system of the AC cows might be suppressed after calving as has been reported in literature for cows in the early lactation period.",

IPA analysis showed that these two pathways are represented by numerous affected genes, of which 14% were upregulated and 40% were downregulated.

Concordantly, all of them were highly significantly downregulated after vaccination in BC cows (S2 Table). The substantial downregulation of protein biosynthesis in the BC group is in agreement with the upregulation of DR1 (S2 Table), the down-regulator of transcription and negative cofactor of TATA box protein binding, which is known to inhibit the assembly of the RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex [42]. A vaccination-induced downregulation of the protein biosynthesis process was not observed in AC cows. Details regarding downregulation of protein translation as primary mechanism to protect the individual against virus replication by preventing viral structural protein synthesis have been discussed in our previous report [19]. The mechanism including the protection against viral dsRNA via inhibition of protein synthesis is obviously a main immune response in cows vaccinated prior to parturition. This mechanism seems to be impaired in cows vaccinated in the period after calving, consequently, the AC cows are compromised regarding the ability to incapacitate virus replication and spread by activating the respective antiviral processes regulating the shut-off of protein synthesis.",

Due to its cytokine similarity features it can be assumed that the XLOC_32517 locus might be involved in growth and differentiation of hematopoietic precursor cells from various lineages, including granulocytes, macrophages, eosinophils and erythrocytes, stimulation of which is of higher relevance for the response to antigen challenge in early lactating cows.",

In contrast, the expression of ARG1 was not affected in the BC cows. Stimulation of ARG1 activity reduces the availability of arginine as precursor for NO synthesis via inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2). A differential regulation pattern of NOS2 and ARG1 is thought to correspond to either classical (M1) or alternative (M2) macrophage activation, although this mechanism is still under debate and a more complex regulatory network might be responsible for macrophage polarization [45,46]. As displayed in Fig 4, ARG1 activity is switched on in M2 macrophages via IL10/IL4/IL13 induction. Activated ARG1 function has been reported to compensate unrestrained inflammation by producing cytokines suppressing the NO-mediated inflammation and cytotoxicity immune response. Thus, L-arginine metabolism in macrophages is a key determinant of defense against pathogen infection and has emerged as a defining feature of alternative versus classical macrophage activation [45\u201347]. It has been reported that M2 activated macrophages possess various functions including regulation of tissue remodeling processes, angiogenesis and antibody-mediated inflammatory responses [48\u201350]. In humans, myeloid cell ARG1-mediated L-arginine depletion was found to profoundly suppress T cell immune responses, and this has emerged as a fundamental mechanism of inflammation-associated immunosuppression [51,52]. Based on the results from the literature and from our vaccination experiment, the upregulation of ARG1 expression in the blood of AC cows may point to an immunosuppressive mechanism underlying the impaired immune capacity of cows after calving. The ornithine generated by ARG1 action can be further metabolized to proline and polyamines, which are involved in cell growth and differentiation and collagen synthesis [53]. In addition, M2 macrophage activation is known to promote blood vessel formation, tissue repair and remodeling [46,54], which is generally necessary in the interval after calving.",

Out of the most significantly affected loci in the AC group after vaccination, the analysis revealed seven loci (S1 Table), which represent genes that operate synergistically in the major function of erythrocyte cells associated with respiratory gas exchange regulating the uptake of carbon dioxide and release of oxygen by erythrocytes: aquaphorin 1 (AQP1), solute carrier family 4, anion exchanger, member 1 (SLC4A1), carbonic anhydrase II (CA2), glycophorin B (GYPB), hemoglobin chains A and B (HBA, HBB) and \u03bc-globin (HBM). The coordinated upregulation of the respective gene network (Fig 5A) was exclusively observed in the AC cows. The upregulation of the gas exchange is pathway in the AC cows is also supported by the functional enrichment analyses of the respective GO terms and KEGG pathways (S5 and S9 Tables). The synergistic modulation of the transcripts integrated in the gas exchange metabolon in the blood transcriptome of AC cows in response to vaccination is reflected in Fig 5B. The respective loci included in the gas exchange pathway are important for erythrocyte membrane biogenesis and responsible to maintain the erythrocyte shape and integrity [56\u201360] and their concerted upregulation also point to activated hematopoiesis and erythropoiesis processes. The primary function of erythrocytes is to transport oxygen in blood, and the primary stimulus for erythrocyte production is low oxygen levels. Enhanced oxygen delivery to oxygen-consuming tissues is required after calving and during early lactation.",

Possibly, the transcriptional profile modulated in the blood of AC cows in response to vaccination might be compromised by the consequences arising out of blood loss and forcing the activation of red blood cell formation postpartum.

Out of the 53 modulated loci, which are involved in this pathway, 34% were downregulated and 4% were upregulated (Table 3, S10 Table). Downstream analysis showed that the majority of the affected loci are members of complex I of the electron transport chain (ETC), which catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone in the inner mitochondrial membrane, but other ETC complexes were also modulated (Fig 6A\u20136C). The remarkable transcriptional downregulation of the genes involved in the mitochondrial ETC in response to vaccination was reflected by results of the functional enrichment analyses of KEGG pathways, which indicated that the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway is significantly affected (S8 Table). Downregulation of a substantial number of genes critical for the mitochondrial function and OXPHOS system points to a repression of ATP production via this pathway in the blood of BC cows. Particularly, the structural integrity of the complex I assembly is known to be essential to maintain its functionality, and an impairment may lead to catalytic problems or instability of the complex assembly [61,62].",

Excessive mitochondrial ROS is known to induce damages of cell components and leads to cell clearance through apoptosis, but ROS abundance is also an important intermediate signal for normal cell immune function, like control of T cell activation [64,65]. In addition to the impaired blood transcript levels of the loci involved in the ETC, an increased expression level was observed for NNT (nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase) in response to vaccination in the BC cows. NNT functions as a redox-driven proton pump catalyzing the hydride transfer between NADH and NADP(+) for proton translocation across the inner mitochondrial membrane. NNT was reported to play a specific role in the control of ROS production and cellular redox state via NADPH [66], in regulating the cofactor balance by coordinating reductive carboxylation and glucose catabolism in the mitochondrial TCA cycle [67] and in modulating macrophage inflammatory responses. NNT overexpression was found to result in reduced intracellular ROS and NO levels and impaired intracellular bacteria clearance [68]. Control of intracellular ROS level is critical for cell survival. Modulation of transcripts associated with ROS production was not observed in BC cows, possibly due to complex I deficiency.",

Mitochondria have the capacity to sense energy status of the cell as well as a variety of cellular stresses and respond with initiation of cell death. Reviewing recent studies about mitochondrial function in pathogen recognition, Tal and Iwasaki [69] concluded that the mitochondria are shaping the innate response to pathogens, and they suggest the existence of a \u201cmitoxosome\u201d, a mitochondrial signalosome or integral platform, where multiple pathways of viral recognition and cellular stress signals converge and are coordinated to generate an antiviral response.",

The PDK4 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 4) transcript abundance increased in parallel in the blood of BC cows in response to vaccination (S2 Table), which fits in the hypothesis of reprogrammed ATP production. PDK4 is known to play a crucial role in glucose utilization and lipid metabolism by regulating the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex that converts pyruvate to acetyl CoA for oxidation and ATP generation in the TCA cycle. Elevated PDK4 expression leads to a suppression of the influx of glycolytic metabolites into mitochondria [70], which in turn, would support the reduction of ATP production via TCA cycle. In cancer cells, a low level of glucose oxidation via TCA cycle has been shown to be due to the constant inhibition of PDH by phosphorylation of one of its four kinases [71\u201373]. Recently, PDK4 was identified as a novel regulator of one of the signaling pathways of mTORC1 via HIFA1 effects and of aerobic glycolysis [74] as well as a novel potential hub that may play a central role in the complex interplay of transcription-factors, transcripts and lipids during the course of monocyte-macrophage differentiation [75].",

This process is characterized by a switch from the ATP production via TCA cycle to the diametrical aerobic glycolysis pathway in order to adjust for high energy and metabolic demands required for cell proliferation, differentiation and cytokine production (e.g., [76\u201379]). This metabolic switch, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect [80], is accepted as a metabolic signature of highly proliferating cells, not only cancer cells but also activated lymphocytes [79,81,82], TLR-activated and NO-producing inflammatory dendritic cells [83\u201385] as a survival response that serves to rebalance ATP levels and to rapidly provide glycolytic intermediates for biosynthetic growth and proliferation processes. Although ATP production via OXPHOS is more efficient than via glycolysis, for macromolecule synthesis and proliferation, glycolysis has been reported to produce ATP at a rate 100 times faster than OXPHOS [86].",

HK1 phosphorylates glucose to produce glucose-6-phosphate, the first step in glycolysis, and HIF1A is a transcriptional factor known to control metabolism, survival and innate immunity in response to inflammation and oxygen deficiency [87] as well as to regulate glycolysis stimulation [88] and cellular reprogramming [89]. The vaccination-induced mitochondrial deficiency and the upregulation of PDK4 and HIF1A may synergize to activate glycolysis to generate maximal quantities of ATP and metabolites required for blood/immune cell proliferation in response to antigen challenge (Fig 7). These regulatory metabolic mechanisms were not modulated in AC cows in response to vaccination. In early lactating AC cows, glucose is primarily needed for lactogenesis, thus availability of glucose for activation of lymphocytes is limited. This may lead to an inhibition of cell proliferation and cytokine production contributing to immunosuppression of these cows.",

            "text": "In summary, the results of our study indicate a differential modulation of transcripts, biological processes and pathways in the two cow groups vaccinated prior to or after calving and show that the different physiological and metabolic status of the cows (non-lactating vs. early lactating) is clearly reflected at the whole transcriptome level in the blood of the divergent cow groups. The response to vaccination elicits a quantitatively and qualitatively divergent regulatory immune defense reaction in the blood transcriptome of each cow group. Remarkably, the non-lactating cows vaccinated prior to calving displayed a substantially higher number of differentially expressed loci compared to the early lactating cows vaccinated after calving. The lower magnitude of the overall transcriptional modulation in the early lactating cows suggests a generally attenuated reactivity in response to antigen challenge. The immune response of non-lactating cows involved an activation of a complex and divergent spectrum of signaling and metabolic pathways for protection against antigen challenge compared to the early lactating cows. Their immune response seemed to be compromised by temporary pivotal physiological challenges associated with the consequences due to calving and the onset of lactation. Thus, the unique vaccination-induced transcriptome signature in the blood of the early lactating cows is characterized by an impaired transcriptional regulation of specific loci associated with the immune defense response in non-lactating cows, which provides evidence for the suppressed capacity for immunomodulation on the molecular level in early lactating cows. The results of our study can contribute to build a model of key signaling pathways that are modulated divergently in response to vaccination and to identify potential specific biomarkers characteristic for divergent immune responses.",
