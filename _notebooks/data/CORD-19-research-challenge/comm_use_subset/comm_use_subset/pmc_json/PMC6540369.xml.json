More than 200 active ingredients were identified in Glycyrrhiza uralensis of which glycyrrhizin (GL) and glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) are the major bioactive triterpenoid saponins [1]. Chemically, GL is made up of one GA as aglycone and two d-glucuronic acid [2, 3], with a wide range of pharmacological activities. These include anti-inflammatory [4], immunomodulatory, and antiviral, specifically against different DNA and RNA viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus [2, 3, 5]. Clinically, GL is metabolized into GA after oral administration, which then becomes the bioactive molecule in vivo [6, 7]. Indeed, GA has been widely used in both the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industry for its whitening and anti-inflammatory effect [8].",

However, chemical synthesis of GA is not feasible because of its structural complexity. The low GA content in licorice, as precursor of GL, also makes the direct extraction of GA from plants not cost effective. Currently, GA is produced by acid hydrolysis of GL, which accounts for 2\u20138% of the dry weight of licorice [9]. This acid consuming hydrolysis procedure is inefficient and expensive with regard to the consequent environment pollution. On the other hand, the raw materials of GL are mainly extracted from Glycyrrhiza plants whose cultivation is time intensive, requiring 3\u20134 years to reach higher GL content. Deep growth of Glycyrrhiza roots and rhizomes, up to 10 m, underground also results in farmland devastation and eventual desertification after plant harvest, making GA production from Glycyrrhiza cultivation unsustainable.",

The cyclization of 2, 3-oxidosqualene to \u03b2-amyrin catalyzed by \u03b2-amyrin synthase is the first reaction towards GA biosynthesis [24]. After this site-specific oxidation at positions C-11 and C-30, \u03b2-amyrin are catalyzed by two cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP88D6 and CYP72A154, leading to the formation of GA [9, 25]. Subsequently, GA is converted to GL through a recently identified UDP-dependent glucuronosyltransferases, GuUGAT [26]. The complete gene set for GA biosynthesis makes GA production in yeast possible (Fig. 1a).\n",

            "text": "Considering the expanding GA demand and the limited Glycyrrhiza resource supply, our objective was to produce GA from glucose using engineered S. cerevisiae. As a precursor of GA, \u03b2-amyrin was first produced in yeast by Keasling\u2019s group [27], with a resulting concentration of 6 mg/L. It was further improved to 138 mg/L by Li\u2019 s group [28]. We finally improved it into 158 mg/L now (data is under review). From \u03b2-amyrin to GA, it needs two cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP88D6 and CYP72A154, making the synthesis of GA difficult in yeast. Recently, Li\u2019s group successfully achieved glycyrrhetinic acid synthesis in S. cerevisiae and boosted its concentration by introducing efficient cytochrome P450s (CYP450s: Uni25647 and CYP72A63) and pairing their reduction systems [29]. However, only influence of carbon flux in downstream module (the below box in Fig. 1a) on GA production was investigated in that study. Besides CYP450s and CPR1, the carbon flux flowing into MVA pathway from acetyl-CoA, especially into the synthesis of 2,3-oxidosqualene, is crucial to the production of GA. The pipeline of carbon flux flowing into 2,3-oxidosqualene in MVA pathway determined how high that GA\u2019s production can reach. Thus, detailed influence of carbon flux in upstream module of GA should be investigated. Cytochrome b5 genes were believed as an another important factor that facilitates the expression of CYP450s, as it can provide an electron for P450 oxidation. For example, with the identification of CYB5 from Artemisia annua, the production of artemisinic acid was improved sharply in S. cerevisiae.",

            "text": "In this study, we produced glycyrrhetinic acid using the metabolic engineering of S. cerevisiae by introducing the entire heterogeneous biosynthetic pathway of GA. With the overexpression of ERG20, ERG9, ERG1 and tHMG1, we were able to improve GA production by approximately 21%, although this was lower than reported in previous studies. The over expression of tHMG1 significantly increased protopanaxadiol production between 10 and 90 fold depending upon the gene copies integrated in the chromosome of S. cerevisiae [15]. The integration of ERG20, ERG9 and PgSQE1 (squalene epoxidase 1 encoding gene from Panax ginseng) increased protopanaxadiol by 3.3 times [17]. Although protopanaxadiol and GA share the same two precursors, 2 and 3-oxidosqualene, the integration of tHMG1 did not improve GA production to the same extent as protopanaxadiol. Despite an limited increase in GA production, levels of precursors including squalene, ergosterol, and lanosterol of Y2 were much higher than Y1, specifically 50%, 188% and 161%, respectively. This suggests that the improved metabolic flux in the MVA pathway of strain Y2 by the integration of ERG20-ERG9, ERG1 and tHMG1 were likely directed to the sterol synthesis, and partially to GA synthesis. This finding is supported by previous studies, which also reported the transcription level of ERG20 and ERG9 increased 3.3- and 2.8-fold in overexpressed ERG20 and ERG9 strains for \u03b2-amyrin production in the \u03b2-amyrin producing strain [28]. Our results showed a 66% increase of \u03b2-amyrin in the Y2 strain compared to strain Y1. We believe that the increase in \u03b2-amyrin through the integration of ERG20-ERG9, tHMG1, and ERG1 was partially catalyzed to form both 11-oxo-\u03b2-amyrin and GA, leading to lower increases of \u03b2-amyrin. Constructing protein fusion can be highly effective in enhancing the metabolic flux channeled to the synthesis pathway of desired products by engineering their active sites to a closer proximity [20]. In this study, the fusion of ERG20 and ERG9 was constructed to direct the FPP flux to squalene production with two modules of ER20-ERG9 and ERG9-ERG20. Results indicated that the fusion of ER20-ERG9 enhanced the conversation of FPP to squalene although more carbon flux was directed into sterol.",

The poor coupling between cytochrome P450 and CPR may have lead to the release of reactive oxygen species, decreasing cell growth and product yields [13, 34]. Previous findings have shown that CYB5 facilitates and in some cases was required for the reduction of P450 enzymes by providing an electron for P450 oxidation (Additional file 1: Fig. S7) [35\u201337]. The introduction of newly identified GuCYB5 in this study was highly efficient in improving GA production as indicated by our results. With AtCPR1 providing the electron for CYP450, oxidation was less efficient than CPR1 derived from G. uralensis (GuCPR1) in GA production [29]. The limited coupling between CYP88D6, CYP72A154 and AtCPR1 resulted in a relatively lower GA yield, and highlighted the effectiveness of GuCYB5, which significantly improved the production of GA. Therefore, future work should focus on balancing the expression between CYP88D6, CYP72A154, and CPR for heightened optimization due to the importance for cell growth and product synthesis. Formerly, GuCPR1 was identified as presenting the highest electron transfer efficiency among several related CPRs from different plant sources recently [29]. Additionally, future work should include self-sufficient P450 reduction enzyme construction to further increase GA production efficiency.",

In the fed-batch fermentation process, we found that 11-oxo-\u03b2-amyrin reached nearly 80 mg/L. These results demonstrate that rate-limiting steps exist in the 11-oxo-\u03b2-amyrin to GA conversion. There are two CYP450 genes responsible for catalyzing \u03b2-amyrin to GA: CYP88D6 and CYP72A154, of which CYP72A154 is a transmembrane protein (Additional file 1: Fig. S8). From this, the rate-limiting step in GA production was likely the final step catalyzed by CYP72A154 and investigating the protein engineering of CYP72A154 is imperative. We deduce that N-terminal amino acid residues used to truncate CYP72A154 will improve GA production, and further systematic investigation is needed. Like CYP71AV1 in A. annua, CYP72A154 mostly catalyzes 11-oxo-\u03b2-amyrin to form GA, leading to the intermediate formation of 30-hydroxy-11-oxo-\u03b2-amyrin and glycyrrhetaldehyde (Fig. 1a). An identification of aldehyde dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase from G. uralensis is also needed to improve the catalytic capacity of CYP72A154. Further work addressing these aspects of GA production will enhance GA production like artemisinic acid and strictosidine producing strain construction [13, 22].",

Utilizing these methods we were able to show a 40-fold increase of GA attaining 0.5 mg/L in a flask batch fermentation condition. GA production was further improved to 8.78 mg/L by fed-batch fermentation, 630 times higher than the parent strain.
