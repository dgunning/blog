            "text": "Enteric viruses are common causes of diarrhea in humans and animals. Porcine rotavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) are well known enteric viruses, leading to high morbidity and mortality in piglets and causing economic losses in swine-producing countries. Rotavirus belongs to the genus rotavirus within the family Reoviridae. It consists of a triple-layered capsid encapsulating a genome consisting of eleven segments of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that encodes six structural (VP1-VP4, VP6 and VP7) and six non-structural (NSP1-NSP6) proteins. According to the inner capsid protein VP6, 10 different species/groups (A-J) of rotavirus have been identified using a 53% amino acid cut-off value sequence classification system1\u20133. Rotavirus group A, B, C, E and H have been detected in pig feces4\u20138. The glycoprotein VP7 and the protease-sensitive protein VP4, which elicit neutralizing antibodies, form a genotyping system within the rotavirus A species9. Until now, 35 G-genotypes (VP7) and 50 P-genotypes (VP4) were identified. The most prevalent rotavirus group A (RVA) strains in pigs are G3, G4, G5, G9, and G11 in association with P[6], P[7] P[13] and P[23] and the most predominant genotype combination among porcine RVA strains is G5P[7] worldwide10,11. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus belong to the group I coronaviruses. They are enveloped viruses with an approximately 28.5 kb single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome encoding four structural proteins: the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleoprotein (N) protein. The spike protein is the major target for neutralizing antibodies. It mediates the virus binding to the cell surface receptor aminopeptidase N and plays a role in the fusion between the viral envelope and the cell membrane12,13. The nucleoprotein wraps the virus genome and supports virus assembly14. The membrane protein is mostly embedded in the lipid membrane and plays an important role in the virion architecture15. They cause lethal watery diarrhea and dehydration in piglets and destroy villous enterocytes in the small intestine. The severity and lethal outcome are strain dependent16. Different non-intestinal cell lines have been used in the past for virus cultivation in vitro17,18, but at low efficiency. TGEV can be propagated in swine testicle (ST) and porcine kidney (PK-15) cells. Upon adaptation, PEDV may infect African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells. Like TGEV and PEDV, rotavirus is mainly transmitted by fecal-oral route and virus infection causes the destruction of mature small intestinal enterocytes. Similarly, most rotavirus research was conducted on non-polarized MA104 cells (African green monkey kidney epithelial cells) which are easy to culture and permissive for certain rotavirus strains of different genotypes. But there are still a lot of genotypes of rotavirus strains that do not grow in MA104 cells8. Data concerning the replication cycles of these enteric viruses in their target cell (mature intestinal enterocytes) are scarce. To this end, it is essential to obtain cultures of porcine intestinal enterocytes.",

            "text": "The gastrointestinal tract is lined with a rapidly proliferating simple columnar epithelium. The epithelial cells migrate from the crypts where mitosis takes place towards the top of the villi (small intestine) or towards the top of the intercrypt (large intestine) as they mature. Mature epithelial cells are replaced by a steady supply of crypt cells. In suckling piglets, intestinal epithelial cells renew every 2\u20133 days. Because of the highly dynamic and rapid renewal properties of intestinal epithelial cells, it is difficult to successfully culture them in vitro. In 2014, a porcine mid-jejunum epithelial cell line was established from neonatal piglets by immortalization upon transfection/transduction with human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene19. Because the immortalization alters the biology of the original cells, field viruses replicate more efficiently in primary cells than in continuous cell lines. Therefore, it is advisable to use primary cells for virus research. Intestinal enteroids have been developed by culturing intestinal crypts onto Matrigel which is enriched with laminin \u03b11 and \u03b1220. Enteroids enhanced the viability of the cells and were already used for the study of rotaviruses21, noroviruses22 and enteroviruses23. The successful cultivation of enteroids is dependent on many growth factors, critically including Wnt 3a, R-spondin, and Noggin, which is an expensive method.",

Myofibroblasts contribute to the growth and differentiation of intestinal enterocytes by secreting several growth factors (hepatocyte growth factor, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b21)25,26, insulin-like growth factors (ICFs)24), extracellular matrix proteins (collagen type IV, laminin-\u03b21 and \u03b31, and fibronectin), cytokines and chemokines.

Immunofluorescence stainings were performed against the epithelial cell marker cytokeratin and myofibroblast marker \u03b1-smooth muscle actin. In the porcine ileum, a lot of myofibroblasts were located in the lamina propria directly underneath the epithelial cell layer of the villi, representing the largest cell population in the lamina propria. Fewer myofibroblasts (<5%) were observed in the lamina propria underneath the epithelial cell layer in colon. In contrast, the myofibroblasts formed an integral line underneath the epithelial cell layer in the colon crypts (Fig. 1). These results show that porcine small and large intestinal epithelial cells grow in close contact to myofibroblasts in vivo.

Cells were stained positive for \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), vimentin and fibronectin, which are all markers of myofibroblasts. The cells were negative for desmin, cytokeratin and sucrase-isomaltase (Fig. 2B). These results confirmed that the cells isolated from the ileum subepithelial layer were myofibroblasts. Primary ileum epithelial cells were used as control, which were positive for cytokeratin and sucrase-isomaltase (Fig. 2C).",

In this study, a myofibroblast cell line was established from porcine ileum which was identified by the presence of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, vimentin and fibronectin. The in vivo distribution of epithelial cells and myofibroblasts shows that a lot of myofibroblasts directly grow underneath the epithelium in porcine ileum and that myofibroblasts form an integral line along colon crypts.

However, the successful cultivation of intestinal epithelial cells still poses a big challenge because of the rapid death/apoptosis of isolated epithelial cells which in vivo renew every 2\u20133 days. This apoptosis may be triggered by the disruption of the epithelial cell contact with extracellular matrix. A dispase and collagenase combination was used for epithelial cell isolation in the present study, which preserves more cell-to-cell interactions and reduce the damage of cell-matrix adhesions29. The contamination with stromal cells is a huge problem for epithelial cell cultivation. In order to decrease the contamination with mesenchymal cells, we removed these cells by D-sorbitol density centrifugation and plastic adhesion for 2 hours. According to the specific property that stromal cells attach to plates faster than epithelial cells, most stromal cells were separated from epithelial cells after 2 hours incubation. In the presence of ileum myofibroblasts, both ileum and colon epithelial cells are growing longer than one week and maintain their polygonal, cobblestone-like morphology. In the absence of myofibroblasts, epithelial cells died after 2\u20133 days, even when supplemented with 20% conditioned medium collected from myofibroblast cultures. Our data indicate that the supporting effect of myofibroblasts for epithelial cell growth is very dependent on the direct contact between these two cell types. We also demonstrated that myofibroblasts not only support the growth of intestinal epithelial cells from newborn piglets, but also the epithelial cells of 6 weeks old pigs (data not shown), which confirms the important role of myofibroblasts on epithelial cell proliferation independently of the age of the donor. The epithelial cells in co-cultures were identified by the presence of cytokeratin which is regarded as an important marker of epithelial cells. Most of the cells (>90%) preserved their epithelial nature with a positive staining of cytokeratin after 3 days of co-cultivation. Remarkably, the myofibroblasts clustered into aggregates in this co-culture system. It seems that myofibroblasts retracted into aggregates during the expansion of epithelial cells growth. In earlier reports, it was shown that myofibroblasts can migrate to wound tissue and demonstrate high contractile activities to generate tissue contractures, which help wound healing and organ remodeling by secretion of extracellular matrix proteins and exerting strong contraction force30\u201332. In addition, human and porcine myofibroblasts express S100A4 proteins which have been demonstrated to be implicated in cancer cell migration30,33. Taken together all this information, we hypothesize that myofibroblasts first secrete extracellular matrix proteins, such as collagen and laminin, coordinating the attachment and proliferation of epithelial cells and migration of myofibroblasts in clusters. Epithelial cells co-cultured with myofibroblasts showed microvilli after 3 days of co-cultivation which is in accordance with the reported data that myofibroblasts not only support the growth of epithelial cells, but also stimulate the differentiation of epithelial cells34.",

            "text": "Rotavirus research is hampered by the lack of susceptible enterocyte cell lines. Although some cell lines, including MA104, Marc, IPEC-J2 and Caco-2 cells35\u201337 are susceptible to some rotavirus strains, a lot of genotypes of rotavirus, such as P[4], P[6], P[8], P[13] do not grow efficiently in these cell lines. Therefore, enterocyte cultures are an essential tool to investigate rotavirus-cell interaction. In this study, the susceptibility of primary enterocytes to different rotavirus genotypes were explored. Rotavirus RVA/Pig-tc/BEL/RV277/1977/G1P[7] strain, which was first isolated in Belgium in 1977 from a pool of watery diarrhea of 3 pigs38, is a typical G1 porcine rotavirus. G1 is the most common VP7 genotype of human group A rotavirus, but is rarely found in porcine rotavirus strains39. It is suggested that all human G1 VP7 genes originate from porcine rotavirus transmission to humans and that this interspecies transmission was followed by human-to-human transmissions40. Although rotavirus was reported to have an exclusive tropism for small intestinal enterocytes41, rotavirus RVA/Pig-tc/BEL/RV277/1977/G1P[7] strain could infect both primary ileum and colon epithelial cells with a trypsin treatment. The antigen expression kinetics did not show significant differences in cell tropism of this rotavirus strain. Studies showed that some animal group A rotaviruses, especially porcine rotaviruses recognize sialic acid as host receptor for virus attachment. On porcine small and large intestinal epithelium, sialic acid receptors were clearly detected and colon crypts showed even a greater abundance of sialic acid than small intestines42. Rotavirus genotype P[7] has been classified as a sialic acid-dependent genotype43, which may explain why rotavirus G1P[7] strain could also infect colon epithelial cells in vitro. Both ileum and colon epithelial cells were also susceptible to four fecal suspensions containing different rotavirus genotypes (G5P[13], G5P[7], G9P[23] and G4P[6]). G5P[7] and G9P[23] rotaviruses, which are the predominant G/P genotype combination of circulating rotaviruses in Belgium, were more infectious than the other two strains, which was also observed on MA104 cells8. The higher infectivity in enterocytes in vitro may explain the wide prevalence of these genotypes in the field. Rotavirus P[6] genotype is one of the major human rotavirus genotypes. It is associated with symptomatic infection in children and is frequently detected in Africa. In pigs, P[6] rotaviruses are also regularly detected and most of these strains display a high genetic similarity to human P[6] rotavirus strains8,44. Animal rotaviruses are regarded as a potential reservoir for the genetic and antigenic diversity of human rotaviruses and interspecies transmission from swine to humans has been reported increasingly for P[6] genotype. Eight Hungarian human G4P[6] rotavirus strains were supposed to originate from pigs by independent events of zoonotic transmission10. Therefore, studying porcine rotavirus is a key step to deeply understand the evolution of human rotavirus. Recent studies demonstrated that P[6] rotavirus strains recognize human histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), which explains why most human rotavirus strains cannot be cultured in MA104 cells. In our study, rotavirus G4P[6] could infect both ileum and colon epithelial cells which demonstrates that the primary enterocytes contain the cellular receptor for rotavirus P[6], likely containing the right HBGAs. This receptor is still not identified. Rotavirus almost exclusively infects mature enterocytes of the small intestinal villi in vivo41, while in vitro, the large intestinal epithelial cells could also be infected, which leads us to think that other factors in the large intestines block the rotavirus infection of colon epithelial cells in vivo. In the enterohepatic circulation, bile salts are synthesized in the liver, travel to the gall bladder and are secreted into the descending part of the duodenum helping in the digestion of fats and other substances. Up to 95% of secreted bile salts are collected in the ileum and return back to the liver via the portal system. We hypothesize that the lack of bile salts in the lumen of the large intestines may be the reason why rotavirus cannot infect the epithelial cells of large intestines in vivo. In order to test this hypothesis, we collected bile from the porcine gall bladder and used it for the infection of rotavirus to primary ileum epithelial cells. The results show that the infectivity of rotavirus in ileum epithelial cells increased after treatment with bile (Supplementary Fig. S1), which is in accordance with the results that bile/bile acids are essential for porcine enteric calicivirus, hepatitis C virus and human norovirus infection in cells22,45,46.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus primarily replicate in the villous enterocytes of the small intestine. Porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN), one of the type II cell surface metalloproteases, was reported to be a cellular receptor for both PEDV and TGEV47\u201349. Although these two viruses bear similarities in structure and disease, they are clearly distinct. In vitro, PEDV does not grow in continuous cell cultures which are permissive to TGEV. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate the susceptibility of the target cell, primary porcine enterocytes, to both PEDV and TGEV. Interestingly, we found that TGEV Purdue can infect both ileum and colon epithelial cells, whereas the virulent Miller strain only infects ileum epithelial cells and that the infectivity of the Purdue strain is much higher than the Miller strain in ileum epithelial cells. The Purdue and Miller strains are two virulent American TGEV strains, which originally caused 100% mortality of less than 2-weeks-old piglets due to the lytic infection of enterocytes. The Purdue strain used in this study has been passaged 114 times in primary porcine kidney cells and then adapted to grow in ST cells by one more passage50. A nucleotide mutation (T to G at nucleotide position 1753) of the Purdue S protein, which causes a serine (S) to alanine (A) mutation at aa 585 was reported18. This mutation is present in the domain of the S protein encoded by nucleotide 1518\u20132184 which is used for the cell receptor pAPN recognition51. This mutation may make the virus more suitable to grow in pAPN negative cultures/primary porcine kidney cells due to the recognition of other cell receptors. It may also be responsible for the growth of the Purdue strain in primary porcine colon epithelial cells and porcine myofibroblasts which are both negative for pAPN (Supplementary Fig. S2). Due to the absence of pAPN, the Miller strain cannot infect the primary colon epithelial cells. PEDV CV777 strain has been adapted to grow in the APN negative Vero cells by several blind passages and has been widely used for PEDV research. We found that primary ileum epithelial cells were more susceptible to the CV777 Vero adapted strain when the cells were grown in absence of FBS and the CV777 fecal suspension only infected the cells which were cultured without FBS. FBS is usually added in culture medium for cell growth because it contains various biological factors. But its compositional complexity also causes a lot of side-effects, such as the inhibition of cell differentiation and virus replication. FBS may inhibit viral replication by blocking cellular proteins, as shown for another nidovirus porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV)52. CV777 strain shows a lower infectivity in ileum epithelial cells cultured with FBS suggesting that FBS contains factors that interfere with PEDV infection or that without FBS the epithelial cells could differentiate better which makes them more susceptible to PEDV infection. The susceptibility of primary ileum epithelial cells to a PEDV fecal suspension represents a big step for further investigating PEDV field isolates.",

This might be caused by the antiviral response of interferons, especially type III IFNs (IFN-\u03bb). Interferons belong to the class of cytokines, which are made and released by host cells to trigger protective defenses to several pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria and parasites. Intestinal epithelial cells abundantly produce type III IFNs and elicit antiviral defenses in response to viral infections. Zhang and colleagues demonstrated that IFN-\u03bb possesses a strong antiviral effect on PEDV replication in the porcine intestinal epithelial cell line IPEC-DQ, a subclone obtained from the nontransformed IPEC-J2 cells by limited serial dilutions53. A similar strong IFN-\u03bb might have been rapidly induced in the currently described co-cultures. Furthermore, rotavirus, PEDV and TGEV infect mature villous epithelial cells. In our co-culture system, not only the mature villous epithelial cells were cultured but likely also the less differentiated intestinal crypt epithelial cells. These undifferentiated crypt epithelial cells might cause the low infection efficiency. In future work, efforts will be made to stimulate the differentiation of primary epithelial cells and control the IFN antiviral response in order to increase the infection efficiency.",

Then, the other side was also closed with a surgical clamp. The intestinal mucosa was digested in DMEM containing dispase II (1.2 mg/ml) and collagenase I (0.4 mg/ml) for 20 min at 37 \u00b0C. Then, the PBS was released from the lumen by removing one clamp. The mucosa was gently scraped with a sterile scalpel blade. Afterwards, the intestinal lumen was filled again with PBS and the mucosa was digested in DMEM containing dispase II (1.2 mg/ml) and collagenase I (0.4 mg/ml) again for another 20 min (ileum) or 40 min (colon) at 37 \u00b0C. Subsequently, the digested mucosa was deeply scraped with a sterile scalpel blade. The scrapings were incubated in DMEM containing dispase II (1.2 mg/ml) for 10 min whilst pipetting. After centrifugation (140 \u00d7 g, 4 min at 4 \u00b0C) the pellet was resuspended in DMEM containing 2% D-sorbitol and 2.5% FBS and centrifuged at 50 \u00d7 g for 4 min at 4 \u00b0C to separate single stromal cells. This sorbitol process was repeated at least 5 times. Afterwards, the pellet was resuspended in DMEM supplemented with antibiotics and filtered using a 100 \u03bcm cell strainer (Falcon). After centrifugation (338 \u00d7 g, 10 min), the pellet was finally resuspended in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 0.1 mg/ml gentamycin, 10% FBS, 0.01% fungizone, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Sigma), 1% insulin-transferrin-selenium-ethanolamine (Gibco BRL) and 1% non-essential amino acids and seeded in 6-well plates in order to let the mesenchymal cells attach and separate enterocytes from mesenchymal cells. After 2 h incubation at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2, the non-adherent cell clusters in the 6-well plates were collected and reseeded on top of the monolayer of myofibroblasts. To confirm the support effect of myofibroblasts, cell clusters were also seeded on porcine collagen type I/III (Gentaur, Kampenhout) coated plates and cultured with/without 20% conditioned medium. The cells were further incubated at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 and the medium was refreshed every 2 days. Morphological features of primary enterocytes were evaluated by light microscopy (Olympus).",
