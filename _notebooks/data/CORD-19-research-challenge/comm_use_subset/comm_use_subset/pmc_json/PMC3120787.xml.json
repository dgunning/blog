            "text": "Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) is a common pathogen with worldwide seroprevalence rates ranging from 50% to 90% [1-3]. It is a neurotropic virus that is in the subfamily of alpha herpesvirinae. Initial or primary infection with HSV-1 mostly occurs during childhood in mucoepithelial surfaces and is generally mild or asymptomatic. Upon infection of epithelial cells, HSV-1 initiates lytic replication, and at the end of this cycle, the virus infects sensory neurons proximal to the site of primary infection. Virions can travel via retrograde axonal transport to the cell bodies of neurons in the trigeminal ganglia where lifelong latency is established [4]. The latent virions can reactivate due to unknown causes and prohibit subsequent lytic infections. The most common form of lytic infection is the cold sore or fever blister where viral replication takes place in the orofacial mucosa [5]. Infection of the brain leads to herpes encephalitis, a dangerous condition that can cause permanent neurological damage with high mortality [5]. Orofacial infection, although less threatening, represents the major route for transmission to a naive host.",

            "text": "Lytic infections of HSV-1 are typically characterized by the entry of virus into the cell and translocation of the viral genome into the nucleus followed by replication and evasion of host defenses in order to disperse and persist in the environment. Gene expression of HSV-1 is tightly regulated in a cascade fashion. The three temporal classes of genes are designated immediate-early (\u03b1), early (\u03b2) and late (\u03b3) genes [8]. There are five \u03b1 genes, designated ICP0, ICP4, ICP22, ICP27, and ICP47. The \u03b1 genes were defined by the presence of the cis element for induction by VP16, which interacts with cellular factors, including the protein Oct-1, a homeobox protein, to activate viral immediate early (IE) gene transcription in trans [9,10]. The expression of \u03b2 genes requires the expression of \u03b1 genes, especially functional ICP4. ICP0 enhances the ability of ICP4 to trans-activate \u03b3 genes [11]. The expression of \u03b3 gene has been shown to be blocked by effective concentrations of DNA synthesis inhibitors [12]. All of these steps require interaction between viral and host components. The communication between virus and host factors is being investigated by many laboratories but is not understood completely, and identification of host factors that interact with the virus remains a challenge. Additional information will identify new drug targets for treatment and will aid in understanding the complex processes of initiation of HSV-1 latency and reactivation.",

The Early Growth Response (EGR) family belongs to the C2H2-type zinc-finger proteins [13-15]. Egr-1 functions as a convergence point for many signaling cascades and is known to play an important role in regulating inflammation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis [16]. Our previous transient cotransfection studies with promoter plasmids and Egr-1 expression vector showed that Egr-1 regulated HSV-1 ICP22 and ICP4 promoter activity [17]. In the present study, we demonstrate for the first time that Egr-1 protein is induced rapidly in cells such as SIRC and VERO upon infection. Using inhibitors of the transcription factors CREB and NF\u03baB, we further investigate the mechanism by which HSV-1 induces Egr-1 activation",

Western blotting analysis showed that Egr-1 protein was not present in VERO cells but was induced upon infection and that its induction was enhanced with increased viral infection (Figure 1A). A time-course study revealed that detectable levels of Egr-1 protein were present at 24 hours post infection, and similar levels were detected at 48 and 72 hours post infection (Figure 1B). Our data also indicated that Egr-1 protein was induced in rabbit corneal cells SIRC under similar conditions (Figure 1C). In addition, human corneal cell line HCE-2 was sufficient to produce Egr-1 upon HSV-1 infection (data not shown). However, Egr-1 was not inducible in HEK293 cells. Endogenous Egr-1 was present in uninfected 293HEK cells and the production was not stimulated by viral infection (Figure 1D). To further confirm the induction of Egr-1 by HSV-1, immunofluorescence staining was performed on infected cells. A recombinant HSV-1 constitutively expressing EGFP was used to infect the cells followed by fixation, blocking, and incubation with primary and secondary Egr-1 antibody (shown in red). The results supported the previous observation that Egr-1 protein (red) was co-expressed only in the cells infected with EGFP virus (green) (Figure 2). Together, these results strongly indicated that Egr1 protein was induced by HSV-1 infection.",

By inhibiting the pathways known to be involved in Egr1 induction, we determined that NF\u043aB and CREB play roles in Egr1 expression induced by HSV-1. CREB is activated and stabilized by HSV-1 ICP10 and can modulate viral-induced apoptosis [47]. Studies have reported the presence of NF\u043aB regulatory sequence [24] and CRE [25] in the human Egr-1 promoter. Transient activation of NF\u043aB during the first few minutes of HSV-1 infection has been reported [48,49]. In addition, most of the up-regulated mRNA upon infection was NF\u043aB-dependent [50]. Furthermore, NF\u043aB-dependent gene expression is directly related to a number of stress-induced activities in eukaryotic cells [51]. Since Egr-1 is induced by stress and is known to control a variety of divergent cellular responses, it is possible that this induction is NF\u043aB-dependent. Therefore from the host cell standpoint, viral infection can be considered as a stress and Egr1 is rapidly induced to turn on various cellular responses.",

Since Egr1 is expressed in neural tissues, it could play a role in the maintenance of latency and subsequent reactivation. In addition, our preliminary studies revealed that Egr1 induced by viral infection was sufficient to interact with the ICP22 EBE during the lytic infection of SIRC and the over-expression of Egr-1 enhanced HSV-1 gene expression, replication, and release of infectious viruses (unpublished data). Together, these results suggest the involvement of Egr-1 in HSV-1 gene expression/replication via regulation of \u03b1-genes. Recombinant virus over-expressing Egr-1 and stable cell lines containing siRNA repressing Egr-1 are being constructed to further investigate the roles of Egr-1 during HSV-1 lytic infections.",

It is likely that the binding of the viruses to the cell surface is sufficient to trigger the expression of Egr-1. Viral binding to the target cell is mediated by envelope glycoprotein gB, gC, or gD and the entry is mediated by gD to one of the cell surface receptors, such as the Herpes Virus Entry Mediator (HVEM)), heparan sulfate, nectin-1/2, and cell adhesion molecules from the immunoglobulin superfamily [52]. HVEM belongs to the superfamily of TNF (tumor necrosis factor)/NGF (nerve growth factor) receptors [53], and has been identified independently as TR2 (TNF receptor like-2) [54]. The Egr-1 gene can be regulated by TNF [55] and NGF [56] in cultured cells, and NF\u043aB can be activated by the gD/HVEM [57]. Therefore, Egr-1 induction quite possibly can be correlated to the binding of viral glycoprotein to HVEM or other cellular surface receptors. Additional experiments are required to determine the induction mechanisms of Egr-1 by viral infection.",

The Egr1 induced by HSV-1 in corneal cells could have implications in viral pathogenesis, inflammation, and disease progression.
