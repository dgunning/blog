            "text": "Rhizoctonia solani K\u00fchn [teleomorph: Thanatephorus cucumeris (Frank) Donk] represents an important species complex of known plant pathogens, which infect a wide variety of plant species including many economically important crops [1]. Due to its soil-borne nature, facultative saprophytism and the wide host-range, this pathogen is difficult to control by conventional agronomic measures like fungicides, crop rotation or plant resistance [2]. Rhizoctonia is considered as ubiquitous in soil, but has limited abilities of long distance spread, because it does not produce asexual spores [1, 3]. To understand the epidemiology of diseases caused by Rhizoctonia, especially regarding the disease suppression observed in association with monoculture of host plants, the interaction of the fungus with its environment and, in particular, the microflora has been studied by many researchers [4]. Today, it is well established that Rhizoctonia is significantly affected by suppressive organisms, but the nature of this biocontrol is still a matter of debate [4]. The finding that hypovirulent isolates of Rhizoctonia can be successfully used for biocontrol purposes, raised also interest in the possible involvement of mycoviruses [5, 6].",

            "text": "Mycoviruses have been identified in all major fungal taxa and the number of newly described species has expanded enormously during the last years [7]. The increasing usage of deep sequencing approaches will further enhance this trend, leading to a better understanding of the diversity of mycoviruses and the interaction with their hosts. To date, thirteen viral families have been recognized by the International Committee for the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) that harbor mycoviruses [8]. Most of the mycoviruses characterized possess an RNA genome consisting either of single-stranded or double-stranded RNA, which in some cases is segmented [7]. In general, mycoviruses are considered as endogenous viral elements without an extracellular phase. An exception from this assumption has been discovered recently by Yu and coworkers, who identified a novel mycovirus species, related to the ssDNA Geminiviridae, which is reported to be transmitted via spray application of purified virions and induces hypovirulence [9]. Nevertheless, in most cases mycoviral infections are cryptic [10, 11] and only little is known about the interaction of these pathogens with their hosts [12]. The advances in the field of mycovirology achieved during the last years indicate that these interactions are rather diverse, ranging from mutualism, e.g. improvement of the adaption abilities of the host towards abiotic stress [13], to severe impairment including irregular growth, diminished reproduction, lack of pigmentation and hypovirulence [14]. Using mycoviruses, which induce such impairments in their host, for the control of plant pathogens in agricultural systems is a tempting approach. Factors, like the homogenous environmental conditions and the low species diversity, which facilitate the development of plant diseases, might also facilitate the spread and development of mycoviral infections of the plant pathogens [15]. Successful examples, like the biocontrol of chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica) caused by hypoviruses, raises hope to exploit also other mycoviruses as biocontrol agents [16]. Nevertheless, the first step towards a mycovirus based biocontrol system is the identification of suitable viral candidates. Numerous studies have been carried out indicating a high diversity among R. solani infecting mycoviruses [17\u201320]. However, only a small number of different species has been characterized so far, including species of the Partitiviridae, Endornaviridae, Narnaviridae and a few unclassified mycoviruses [21\u201328]. Deep sequencing analysis, especially of viral metagenomes, is currently the most efficient way to identify unknown viruses. On the one hand, it might allow the identification of promising biocontrol candidates and on the other hand, it can provide important information about the global ecology and evolution of mycoviruses [15, 29]. Until now, studies showed that 60 to 95% of the sequences derived from viral metagenome sequencing do not find homologous sequences in the NCBI database and mycoviruses are less well studied compared to animal or plant viruses [12]. This leads to significant difficulties in the characterization of novel mycoviruses from complex viromes. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene is the only gene that is universally conserved among RNA viruses and represents the key for the identification of evolutionary relationships between the respective viruses [30\u201332]. The RdRp domain is typically smaller than 400 amino acids in length. Apart from seven conserved motifs, named G, F1-3, A, B, C, D, E, which are essential for its function and represent about 75% of the domain, the RdRp sequences are highly variable [33]. Considering the diversity of RNA viruses, the sequence similarity of the RdRp domain is too low for the construction of evolutionary trees of all viral families, as only a few amino acid residues like a conserved aspartic acid in motif A exist in all viruses [33, 34]. However, the analysis of the conserved RdRp domain allows the identification of evolutionary lineages, named superfamilies, which show a higher level of conservation within this group [33, 35]. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of the conserved RdRp domain within these superfamilies enables a classification of RNA viruses on family level. The identification of novel RdRp genes in viral genomes therefore represents an efficient way to estimate the viral diversity in the sample, making first taxonomic assignments possible and permits the fast identification of unknown viruses. This study describes the diversity of a fungal virome consisting of a high number of novel RNA mycoviruses, using the viral hallmark gene RdRp for classification.",

The family is divided into the two genera Narnavirus and Mitovirus. The members of the Narnaviridae are only distantly related to other RNA viruses infecting eukaryotes and share higher sequence similarity to bacteriophages of the family Leviviridae [47]. The analysis of the conserved RdRp domains revealed that the R. solani isolate DC17 is the host of six different mitoviruses. Sequence comparisons with all recognized members of the genus Mitovirus allowed the identification of the four conserved motifs I to IV previously described for mitoviruses by Kitahara and coworkers [48]. Multiple alignments identified these motifs as motif F to C and, additionally, motif E and D were detected in this study (Fig 2). So far, 18 different mitoviruses have been characterized in the genus Rhizoctonia, the majority of them in R. solani [49, 50]. Analysis of the conserved RdRp domain indicated that five of the mitoviruses found in this study, represent novel species, as they display only limited sequence similarity to the mitoviruses described so far (Fig 3). These mitoviruses were named Rhizoctonia solani mitovirus 16 to 20 (RsMV-16 to 20). The RdRp domain of one mitovirus identified in the analyzed virome shows high sequence similarity of 92% to Rhizoctonia solani mitovirus 9 (KP900918.1). Since only a partial sequence of this virus has been deposited in the NCBI database, no comparison of the complete RdRp protein was possible, to check whether both viruses fulfill the species demarcation criterion of less than 90% amino acid sequence similarity over the complete RdRp protein [8]. This mitovirus was presumably considered as Rhizoctonia solani mitovirus 9 DC17.",

Sequence comparisons showed that RsEV-3 and RsEV-1 possess 44.2% amino acid homology across the conserved RdRp domain. Comparison of the conserved motifs revealed that the RdRp domain of RsEV1 is incomplete, as the motifs C to E were missing. Sequence comparison of the remaining RdRp domain shows a homology of 52.5% to RsEV-1. Recently, the genome of RsEV-2 was deposited in the NCBI database [50]. Both viruses share 63.2% sequence identity within the RDRP domain. Due to the high conservation within this region, similarities between different members of the Endornaviridae can also be high, like it is the case for the Bell pepper endornavirus and Phaseoulus vulgaris endornavirus, which share a sequence homology of 74% within their RdRp domains.",

So far, three mycoviruses belonging to the order Tymovirales have been recognized by the ICTV; all of them represent own genera [8]. Whereas Botrytis virus X (Botrexvirus) and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum debilitation-associated RNA virus (Sclerodarnavirus) belong to the Alphaflexiviridae, Botrytis virus F represents the only member of the family Gammaflexiviridae [54\u201356]. The search for conserved RdRp domains with the deduced gene products of the virome of R. solani DC17 revealed the presence of two domains assigned to pfam00978, which were distantly related to each other and to several members of the order Tymovirales. Sequence comparisons with the type species of all genera within the order allowed the identification of the seven conserved motifs A to G (Fig 5). A phylogenetic analysis of this region including all families of the alphavirus-like super family, placed both viruses within the order Tymovirales (Fig 6). They form a distinct clade, which indicates that they may represent members of a so far uncharacterized family within this order.

Instead, they display similarities to the so far unassigned mycovirus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum RNA virus L (SsRV-L), as indicated by BLAST analysis. SsRV-L is a positive-strand RNA virus of 6,043 nts, which carries one large ORF of 1965 aa featuring conserved domains for a methyltransferase, helicase and RdRp [57]. Multiple alignments with other conserved RdRp domains of pfam00978, allowed the identification of the seven conserved motifs A to G (Fig 7). A phylogenetic analysis of this region including different type species from families of the alphavirus-like superfamily showed that the three viruses found in R. solani DC17 form a separate clade together with SsRV-L. This group shows a distant relationship to the families of the Hepeviridae and Alphatetraviridae (Fig 6). Two of the three RdRp domains within this group share a very high sequence similarity of 93% (Table 1), indicating that they possibly belong to the same species. However, comparison of the putative replicase protein spanning the conserved motifs of the methyltransferase, helicase and RdRp reduced this similarity to 77.6% on the amino acid level and to 68.8% on the nucleotide level. Appling the species demarcation criteria of the next suitable relative, the Tymovirales (sequence homology of the RdRp gene < 80% on amino acid or < 72% on nucleotide level) [8], the two RdRp domains can be considered as belonging to different viral species. For this reason, the identified viruses were named Rhizoctonia solani RNA virus 1 (RsRV-1), Rhizoctonia solani RNA virus 2 (RsRV-2), Rhizoctonia solani RNA virus 3 (RsRV-3).",

An alignment with several recognized members of the family Partitiviridae allowed the identification of the conserved domains A to F. It is reported that motif G is not well conserved within this viral family [30]. Nevertheless, an alignment with several other members of the picornavirus-like superfamily indicated the presence of a conserved glycine residue at the N-terminal region of the F motif which we considered as motif G (Fig 8). A phylogenetic analysis of the region spanning these motifs classified this virus as a member the genus Alphapartitivirus (Fig 9). A second contig of 1805 nt carried an ORF coding for a putative protein of 586 aa, which shows highest sequence similarity (24.7%) to the coat protein of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum partitivirus S. To date, three different members of the Partitiviridae have been characterized in the genus Rhizoctonia. Two of them, Rhizoctonia solani dsRNA virus 2 and Rhizoctonia solani virus 717, were isolated from R. solani. The putative partitivirus identified in this study, showed only low sequence similarity of less than 30% within the conserved region of the RdRp to these viruses.

A BLAST analysis of the region revealed that the RdRp domain shows significant sequence similarities to three so far unclassified viruses.

In the virome of R. solani DC17, two conserved RdRp domains of the pfam02123 group were detected. One showed significant similarity of 68% to the RdRp of RnMBV-1, whereas the second RdRp domain displayed lower similarity of only 29%.

A phylogenetic analysis of this region including different type species within the picornavirus-like superfamily as well as some so far uncharacterized viruses, grouped both RdRps into one clade with the families Totiviridae, Chrysoviridae, Quadriviridae and Megabirnaviridae (Fig 9). However, the first RdRp clusters with RnMBV-1 and some other proposed members of the family Megabirnaviridae. The second RdRp shows close a relationship to the recently characterized RdRp domain of the unclassified mycovirus Rhizoctonia fumigate virus 1 (RfV-1) [25]. RfV-1 is a one-segmented dsRNA virus.

However, our study also showed the two main pitfalls of virus characterization in virome samples. In general, virome analysis faces the problem, that no marker gene for targeted amplification like the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) is present in viruses. Instead, other methods for the enrichment of viral sequences are used, which all bring along certain disadvantages. The most popular method is the purification of virus particles, which seems natural, as the viruses used to be defined as capsid-coding organisms [47]. However, the identification of the capsidless hypoviruses and their acceptance by the ICTV changed this [46]. Further progress in the field of mycovirus research revealed that the absence of a coat protein is a common feature among mycoviruses making the approach of particle purification rather unsuitable for virome analysis in fungi. An alternative approach recently used for the characterization of mycoviruses, utilized siRNAs from infected fungi [62]. Even though they were able to detect mycoviruses belonging to the Narnaviridae (ssRNA, unencapsidated), as well as to the Partitiviridae (dsRNA, encapsidated), it is not sure if all mycoviruses are delectable by this method, as interference with RNA silencing seems to be an important trait in mycoviruses [63]. The sequencing of total RNA and DNA is a further popular method but viruses of low a titer might not be detected [63]. Especially in virome analysis of environmental samples, the first level assignment of reads belonging to novel viruses is another problem, when no separation between viral and host sequences has been applied [64]. To overcome the limitations described, we used an extraction of dsRNA, which is a replicative intermediate of all RNA viruses, as starting material for library preparation in order to maximize the number of reads derived from viruses. Still, the coverage between contigs differed enormously, most likely due to differences in the virus titer within the sample, as the whole dsRNA extract was used for analysis, compared to individual dsRNA band excision from the gel. Using equimolar ratios of purified dsRNA fragments would probably improve the uniformity in coverage, but may cause the problem of missing certain species, which, due to low virus titers, are not visualized by gel electrophoresis. However, the coverage can be used for an indication of the dominance of certain viral species in the virome, which is especially interesting, as hypovirulence is reported to be correlated to higher virus titers [65, 66]. Following this hypothesis, RsMV 17 could be of special interest, as its coverage was 17 times higher than the average. Still, some of the contigs representing novel species, like RsFV-1 and RsFV-2 displayed a very low coverage indicating that the contigs do not represent full-length genome components.",

Apart from conserved regions, sequence similarities are too low to draw conclusions about the phylogeny of the virus [67]. The RdRp domain is the best available indicator to identify also novel viruses, sharing no other homologies with known viruses and represents the key for the reconstruction of evolutionary relationships between those viruses [29\u201331]. In general, virus taxonomy is a challenging field since high mutation rates and frequent exchange of whole gene modules lead to a very high sequence divergence, which makes reasonable alignments virtually impossible [67]. Nevertheless, the analysis the RdRp allows clustering above the order level in so-called superfamilies. The identification of the conserved motifs within the RdRp domain is an important point, since only the comparison of homologous sequences will lead to a valid taxonomic assignment [67]. We identified the conserved motifs A to G of the novel viruses, as well as in reference sequences derived from the NCBI database and used an alignment of this region for a first taxonomic classification.",

            "text": "This approach enabled us to get a first and valid impression of the viral diversity of the species inhabiting R. solani DC17 and allowed an identification of novel viruses which might be of special interest in the fields of biocontrol, virus biology and taxonomy. For example, the analysis revealed the presence of the novel mitovirus RsMV-20, which is closely related to Thanatephorus cucumeris mitovirus (TcMV). An infection of Rhizoctonia with TcMV resulted in decreased virulence of the host [21, 68]. Studies using this hypovirulent isolate of Rhizoctonia (AG-3), infected with TcMV, demonstrated its potential use as biocontrol agent [6]. This makes RsMV-20 an interesting candidate for further analysis in regard to hypovirulence induction. Also, a further characterization of RsMBV-1 is promising, since, so far, all described megabirnaviruses, apart from Pleosporales megabirnavirus 1, which was detected in the virome of marine fungi, were associated with hypovirulence of their hosts [61, 69\u201371]. As well, the identification of RsMV-1, which is closely related to AfV-S2 and RnMV-2 is an interesting finding. AfV-S2 and RnMV-2 are reported to feature a rather unusual lifestyle since they possess a one-segmented ssRNA genome, which hijacks the capsid protein (CP) of an unrelated dsRNA virus [57, 58]. The coat protein of RnMV-2 originates from Rosellinia necatrix mycovirus 1, which belongs to a group of novel viruses distantly related to the Totiviridae [57]. In case of AfV-S2, the capsid protein is derived from a member of the Victoriviruses (Totiviridae) [58]. The close relationship between those viruses and the newly identified virus RsMV-1 raises the hypothesis that also RsMV-1 might hijack a CP of another virus. As no totivirus or close relative is present in the virome of R. solani DC17, RsMV-1 would have to use the CP of another virus, like Rhizoctonia solani partitivirus-1 or Rhizoctonia solani megabirnavirus-1. Either way, a finding like this would be interesting in regard to virus interactions and evolution.",
