Specifically, Jenner and Young [14] accomplished a meta-analysis of human immune response to bacteria, viruses and immune stimulants using gene expression profiling comparisons. In the pig, data covering gene expression for immune response have accumulated and now include pig transcriptomic response to viruses, bacteria or non-infectious stimuli (Additional file 1: Table S1), which paves the way for a meta-analysis of such data. The aforementioned individual studies (Additional file 1: Table S1), as well as others, have contributed substantially to the understanding of the pig immune response [15]. Nevertheless, using meta-analysis to identify gene expression patterns shared across a myriad of experiments might contribute to a better comprehension of the biological processes related to the pig immune system.",

Therefore, gaining knowledge of the porcine immune system will undoubtedly benefit many aspects of human disease research.

Whilst innate immunity provides immediate defence against infections, adaptive immunity consists of immune responses characterized by the engagement of B and T cells in pathogen-specific protection [17,18]. Despite being less specific than the adaptive immunity, the innate immune response is critical against viruses, which keep changing their antigenic epitopes [18].",

The activation of an immune response to PRRSV occurs when porcine cells, mainly pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and intravascular macrophages of the placenta and umbilical cord, interact with the virus [23-25]. It has been reported that PRRSV infection stimulated much less IFN-\u03b1 production than did porcine coronavirus or swine influenza virus in the lungs [26], which probably leads to inadequate stimulation of antiviral immune responses and results in persistent viral infection. Furthermore, different isolates of PRRSV are dissimilar in their ability to induce IFN-\u03b1, IL-10 and IL-12 in lung or PAMs. This weakened IFN response plus increased IL-10 expression may contribute to immune modulation by some viral isolates [27,28]. Although much progress has been made in deciphering the PRRSV genetic diversity, biology and transmission routes [29-31], the results from different studies are often contradictory.",

A new meta-analysis approach was used to assess and to confront results from diverse studies, but, most importantly, to identify particular mechanisms operating under PRRSV infection. First, all publically available datasets from immune response experiments using many different microarray platforms and pathogens (Additional file 1: Table S1), including the ones for the response to PRRSV, were considered for the first global meta-analysis. It is important to stress that the scope of this global meta-analysis was to identify commonalities among pig immune response datasets that were characterized by heterogeneity at many levels (challenge system, tissues, pathogens, etc.). Accordingly, the results of this first study determined the most common mechanisms of the pig immune response using very heterogeneous datasets and the shared mechanisms will be referred to as the pig global immune response in this report. Secondly, we performed a meta-analysis considering only the PRRS studies. Finally, we performed a functional analysis considering the genes found only in response to PRRSV and eliminating genes in common with the first global meta-analysis in order to identify particular genes and mechanisms of immunity unique to the response to PRRSV. This study elucidated possible general host-response mechanisms and specific mechanisms in response to PRRSV, confirmed previous results and highlighted new host-pathogen interaction mechanisms.",

The evidences in this meta-analysis are the p-values of each addressed element, which in our case represents the gene expression that corresponds to the probes (elements) on each microarray chip. Consequently, as a first step, we determined the p-value of each microarray clone using a Pointillist significance calculator approach that can analyse the probability distribution of a set of observations and compute the statistical significance of each observation on the basis of that distribution. This probability corresponds to the likelihood that a given observation could happen by chance given the global distribution for all the observations. Accordingly, we employed the cumulative density function of a nonparametric distribution with a Gaussian kernel density [34,35] to calculate the significance of the observations.",

Moreover, mTOR signalling could also be linked to mitochondria dysfunction, as it acts on mitochondrial metabolism [50]. These findings indicate that the aforementioned canonical pathways are all interconnected in the regulation of mRNA translation and mitochondrial metabolism. Taking all together, we hypothesise that the stress provoked by the stimulus affects host cell homeostasis, which prompts the ER to send signals of stress.

Whilst in our analysis, the reported top canonical pathways and biological functions reflected general biological processes, most of the pathways reported in Jenner and Young were closely involved in immune responses and included among others; inflammation response, IFN-stimulated genes and TLR-mediated common and specific response [14]. These differences could be the consequence of different methods used in the two studies. While Jenner and Young used the magnitude of gene expression profiles among experiments as a key factor for clustering the genes with subsequent annotation using biological ontologies, we used a robust methodology based on an optimization algorithm that minimizes the numbers of false positives and false negatives. Furthermore, in this study we included non-infectious perturbations, which might hinder the identification of infectious specific response. Another very plausible explanation to those differences is that the general signature highlighted during the pig global immune response might be due to the sampling process. Therefore, the sampling process might induce a stress response independent of whatever previous perturbation is under investigation. In individual studies it is impossible to distinguish this sampling damage response from other responses but maybe the biggest strength of the meta analysis here is the capability to detect these inadvertent responses.",

Accordingly, we used the fold changes from one microarray platform (Affymetrix) to make a clustering analysis using the significant genes. The co-expression analysis corresponding to the pig global immune response revealed two clusters (Additional file 5: Table S5-A, Additional file 6: Figure S1). The first and second cluster contained 884 and 359 probes, respectively. Mapping the probes within each group onto the IPA revealed that among the top five canonical pathways in cluster 1, four are among the top in the global immune response and are EIF2 Signalling, Regulation of eIF4 and p70S6K Signalling, mTOR Signalling and Mitochondrial Dysfunction. The canonical pathways expressed in the second cluster contained among others, the NRF2-mediated Oxidative Stress Response that was in the 8th position in the pig global immune response (Additional file 7: Table S6). Finding only two clusters in the set of significant genes in this meta-analysis is in concordance with the fact that the meta-analysis approach provides only commonalities among different experiments and that the more heterogeneous the data are, the less common biological pathways one can identify.

First, we performed meta-analysis using all the experiments when PRRSV infection occurred. The total dataset corresponded to 31353 probes in 278 chips from 6 datasets.

Furthermore, the top five molecular and cellular functions in this analysis were: Cellular movement, Cell-To-cell signalling and interaction, Cellular growth and proliferation, Cell morphology and molecular transport (Additional file 4: Table S4B). TREM-1 are abundant receptors, distributed on myeloid cells including neutrophils, CD14 high monocytes/macrophages and lung alveolar macrophages [51]. Stimulation of TREM by its unknown ligand or of toll like receptor (TLR) by lipopolysacharide can provoke the association of TREM1 and TLR, activating interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), NF-\u03baB, and the pro-inflammatory response [51,52]. In this study, the modulation of TREM-1 was associated with changes in expression of chemokines (e. g. CCL2, CCL3), interleukins (IL-6, IL-18, I1-beta), and toll like receptors (TLR2, TLR4) and others molecules such as a transmembrane receptor (CD86), the molecule CD88 and the growth factor receptor bound-2 (GRB2). TREM-1 has been implicated in the amplification of septic shock by enhancing the (TLR)-mediated production of proinflammatory cytokines [53,54] in response to viruses like Marburg virus (MARV) and Ebola virus (EBOV) in humans [55]. If the involvement of TREM-1 and the role of neutrophils are confirmed during PRRSV infection by further investigations, it might be possible to improve the potency of anti-PRRSV vaccines by regulating the recruitment of myeloid cells, especially neutrophils to the site of antigen delivery.",

This might occur among other transcription factors via XBP-1 signalling.
