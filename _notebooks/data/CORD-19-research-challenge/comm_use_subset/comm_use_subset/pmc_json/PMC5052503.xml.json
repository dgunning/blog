The parotid, submandibular, and sublingual salivary glands contribute to 90% of total saliva secretions, while minor salivary glands contribute to the remaining 10%. The amount of saliva secreted by the major and minor glands is referred to as whole saliva. In the resting (unstimulated) state, approximately two-thirds of the total volume of the whole saliva is produced by submandibular glands. Upon stimulation, the parotid glands are responsible for at least 50% of the total volume of saliva from the mouth. Sublingual glands contribute to a small percentage, both in the unstimulated or stimulated states of the salivary glands. Minor salivary glands contribute significantly to the lubrication of the oral mucosa because of their high protein content. Unlike some other minor salivary glands which are composed exclusively of mucous cells, parotid glands are serous and produce water like secretions. Submandibular and sublingual glands are mixed.",

The ductal cells are responsible for further modifications of saliva until it is secreted in the mouth. Saliva is 99% water and 1% protein and salts. The normal daily production of saliva varies between 0.5 and 1.5 liters. The whole unstimulated saliva flow rate is approximately 0.3-0.4 ml / min. This rate decreases to 0.1 ml / min during sleep and increases to about 4, 0-5, 0 ml / min during eating, chewing and other stimulating activities. Saliva is always hypotonic to plasma. As the whole saliva flow rate will increase, the tonicity of the saliva will increase too. Salivary glands secretion is mainly controlled by the autonomous nervous system. Parasympathetic stimulation produces abundant quantities of watery saliva, whereas sympathetic stimulation produces more viscous saliva (Bardow, Nauntofte and Pedersen, 2004).",

When a substance is placed in the oral cavity, the flow of saliva will increase depending on its taste, consistency and concentration. When the volume of saliva is approximately 1.1 ml, a swallowing reflex is triggered. Salivary stimulation, dilution of tasting and swallowing will continue until the concentration of the tastings reaches a point where it ceases to stimulate salivary flow. The oral clearance of various substances will be prolonged in the absence of saliva, resulting in possible harm to intraoral hard and soft tissues. Under normal physiologic conditions the saliva is oversaturated with calcium hydroxyapatite, which prevents dental demineralization. In addition, the salivary protein pellicle protects the teeth against irritants.",

Salivary mucins play a significant role in lubricating the intraoral structures and help forming a barrier against microbial invasion. Lysozyme and lactoferrin are examples of proteins with antimicrobial properties. Lactoferrin is believed to have antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral properties. Salivary peroxidase has antibacterial properties, whereas histatins have been associated with antibacterial and antifungal properties. Salivary epidermal growth factor enhances the speed of the oral mucosal healing and protects the esophageal mucosa. In addition to these proteins with specific functions, other enzymes could serve as indicators in diagnosis, such as pseudo cholinesterase for mental disorders (Giddon and Lisanti, 1962). Saliva contains other organic components, such as glucose, urea, cortisol, sex hormones and blood group substances, which have also been utilized in saliva as screening/diagnostic tools.",

Salivary cortisol level is increased as a response of the adrenal cortex to stressors such as chronic dental anxiety, stressful activities in front of computer, viewing anxiety-inducing videos and masticator muscle activity caused by clenching teeth. Relaxation methods such as viewing soothing videos, listening to music (Music Therapy, Iamandescu, IB, 1997), may lower the saliva cortisol and amylase levels. As noted earlier, the feeling of dry mouth may have a psychological cause. Psychological processes are often accompanied by disturbed oral sensations, and, in fact, most individuals have experienced a sensation of dry mouth during a period of acute stress. Along with depression, mental stress is sometimes associated with a dry mouth condition, either as a result of the disease itself or as an adverse effect of drugs used in management of the psychological state (Bergdahl and others, 1997; Bolwig and Rafaelsen, 1972; Daviessi Gurland, 1961).",

There seems to be differences in salivary cortisol between patients with endogenous and nonendogenous depression (Iorgulescu, 2006) generally, there is a correlation between plasma ACTH levels and salivary cortisol, but this relationship is not present in patients with endogenous depression, suggesting either an effect of medication or a disorder of regulation of cortisol secretion (Galard and others, 1991). Self-induced vomiting and binge eating are features of the bulimia nervosa. Saliva function has been studied in this group and it is known that approximately 25% were affected by sialadenosis (Riad, Barton and Wilson, 1991, Roberts and others, 1989). Some studies have shown that parotid function is reduced in bulimics, meaning that resting and stimulated salivary flow rates are reduced in patients with sialadenosis, and the total protein and amylase levels are increased. Other studies of the parotid and submandibular gland function have shown no differences in function in relation to controls, and amylase levels were equivalent.",

Polypharmacy is the most common cause of xerostomia (complaint of dry mouth) and salivary glands hypofunction (objective evidence of reduced saliva flow rate) in the elderly. The most common types of medication with xerogenic potential are those with anticholinergic and sympathomimetic actions. Salivary gland hypofunction is a condition most often overlooked; many patients who take xerogenic medications may not know that they are at risk of oral complications such as dental caries and fungal infections. Therefore, the absence of subjective complaints of dry mouth sensations does not indicate an adequate level of production of saliva. Accordingly, the diagnosis of drug- induced hyposalivation requires measurements of saliva output or flow rate. ",

For example, the salivary levels of alcohol (ethanol), tobacco (nicotine, cotinine), cocaine, marijuana, opiate and methadone correspond well with their concentrations in serum and are used as screening tools by insurance companies and state institutions to assess exposure to these chemicals. The presence of antigens or antibodies of the pathogens in saliva, such as HIV-1, HIV-2, hepatitis A, B, C, measles, mumps, or rubella, may be used to evaluate possible exposure to these pathogens. Salivary levels of microorganisms (Streptococcus mutants and Lactobacillus acidophilus) and Candida albicans are usually used for assessing susceptibility to dental caries and oral candidiasis, respectively (Fox, 2004; Kaufman & Lamster, 2000). Saliva can also be used to monitor disease progression and the response to pharmacotherapeutic agents such as insulin, cortisol, aldosterone, estrogens, progesterone, lithium, theophilline, and caffeine. Potential salivary biomarkers for diabetes, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, oral cancer, preterm labor and exposure to the coronovirus in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have been the focus of several research activities in recent years. With the remarkable advances in areas such as gene therapy (Voutetakis and others, 2004) and gene mapping, saliva will continue to be a source of opportunities for scientific progress used in risk assessment, disease prevention and development of therapeutic modalities.
