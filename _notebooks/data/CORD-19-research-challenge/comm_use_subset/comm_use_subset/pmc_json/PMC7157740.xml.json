To date, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Austria, Switzerland, as well as the province of Bolzano in Italy, have successfully employed a \u201ctest-and-slaughter\u201d strategy. Other European Union states have implemented compulsory eradication programmes combining \u201ctest-and-removal\u201d with \u201cvaccination\u201d using marker vaccines, conversely to vaccination strategies used in the USA, where non-marker vaccines are used [3]. Marker vaccines are derived from the deletion of one or more genes responsible for the synthesis of glycoproteins or enzymes [4,5].",

This type of immunisation makes it possible to differentiate animals immunised with marker vaccines (gE negative) from those infected or inoculated with traditional non-deleted vaccines (gE positive) through diagnostic tests specific for BoHV-1 gE [4,8,9]. However, a disadvantage of using live marker vaccines is that the virus can remain in a latent state in the immunised animals such that it can be reactivated and excreted following exposure to an immunosuppressive stimulus [10]. Further, marker vaccines administered both intramuscularly and intranasally induce a marked humoral and cell-mediated immune responses [11], however, little information is available regarding the induction of passive immunity.",

It has also been reported that the concentration of maternal antibodies against BoHV-1 in calves after birth and after colostrum ingestion is directly proportional to that present in the mother\u2019s serum [15,16]. Though extensive studies have reported on marker vaccines, there is a need to assess their ability to induce passive immunity. Here, we have made a concerted effort to evaluate passive immunity transmitted from cattle to newborn calves following immunisation with different inactivated marker vaccines.",

In contrast, in a study conducted by Lemaire et al., a low level of antibodies against BoHV-1 was observed in two cows after two vaccinations with inactivated gE-deleted marker vaccines [28]. Moreover, in calves, a decline in maternal antibodies against BoHV-1 and Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus was shown at 168 or 224 days of age, respectively [12,16]. Similar results were also seen in another study, in which a vaccine containing rotavirus, coronavirus, and Escherichia coli was used to immunise pregnant cattle and led to high titres of specific antibodies in their colostrum and milk [29].

In fact, on the day of calving, both groups injected with vaccine A or B showed high NA serum levels against BoHV-1. After birth, calves are born in an agammaglobulinemia state and need colostrum with a high level of immunoglobulins (Igs). In the first 24 h, these Igs can penetrate the bloodstream by binding to the Fc receptors located in the intestinal brush border [31,32]. Produced by B cells or plasma cells in the blood of lactating cows [33], these Igs are responsible for the early protection of newborns against different infections. Furthermore, colostrum contains leukocytes and several antimicrobial proteins, such as complement C3, lactoferrin, lactoperoxidase, and lysozyme. These leukocytes, together with maternal Igs, are involved in conferring orogastric protection [34]; specifically, they can enter the circulation through intestinal adsorption to promote neonatal cellular immunity [35].",

In addition, calves in both the groups showed NA titres similar to those of their mothers approximatively 7 h after birth. Subsequently, the antibody titres decreased until the end of the experiment, when they reached negative values. In both of the vaccinated groups, the difference in antibody titres between cattle and newborn calves could be due to the passage of Igs from mothers to newborns through the colostrum. These results are similar to those obtained by Cervenak et al., showing that when the time of calving approaches, IgG1 massively decreases in maternal serum samples as it binds to mammary epithelial cells. Then, IgG1 is released with colostrum and milk during lactation. Calves undergo so-called gut closure by approximately 24\u201348 h after birth and the adsorbed colostral IgG (IgG1, IgG2) levels fall below 1% [35]. After PCD2, the antibody titres in milk gradually decreased up to PCD180.",

In addition, the antibody titres observed in both the groups of newborn calves, born to the cattle immunised with vaccine A or B (0.85 log10 and 0.75 log10, respectively), on PCD180 were lower than those required to protect them against infection by BoHV-1. Several studies have shown that NAs higher than a value of 0.90 log10 can protect calves against experimental infection [5,10,36]. Moreover, it has been shown that these antibodies appear in nasal secretions from calves as early as the first day after the ingestion of colostrum [37]. The NAs secreted in the respiratory tract mucosa, primarily of the IgG1 class, persist for 15 to 20 days after birth and serum antibodies can be detected until calves reach several months of age [37]. These results are similar to those of other studies [12] showing the persistence of NAs up to PCD170 when using non-marker vaccines.",

Moreover, this study was intended to form the basis of additional research evaluating the effect of different vaccines against IBR. Thus, future studies will be conducted to assess whether passive immunity in calves can protect them against experimental infection using virulent BoHV-1 virus. Overall, the two inactivated gE-deleted marker vaccines against BoHV-1 were shown to (i) be innocuous for pregnant cattle, (ii) effectively transfer passive immunity from dams to calves up to PCD180, and (iii) be suitable for immunisation in IBR eradication programs. Further studies will be conducted to evaluate if passive immunity induced by these vaccines can protect calves from challenge with a virulent (wt) strain of BoHV-1.",
