In contrast to other human viruses, the Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus showed strong tropism for the two types of receptors during the 2009 pandemic [5,6]. This feature may explain the pandemic potential acquired by this virus, since it permitted the virus of swine origin to bind to Sia\u03b12-6Gal (NAC) receptors of the upper respiratory tract, facilitating interpersonal transmission. On the other hand, maintenance of the capacity to bind to Sia\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21- permitted the virus to replicate in the lower respiratory tract, a fact explaining more severe cases of influenza such as severe viral pneumonias observed even in young adults without comorbidities [3,4,6].",

In silico functional analysis suggests that both variants may have putative direct and indirect effect on gene regulation (Table A in S1 File). Splicing analyses suggested that both SNPs may alter splicing of the transcript and consequently the isoforms of the protein. The substitution of guanine (G) for adenine (A) in rs113350588 promotes a change in an exonic splicing enhancer site (disrupting the sites for SF2/ASF proteins interactions), while the substitution of cytosine (C) for thymine (T) in rs1048479 activates a cryptic acceptor site, with the presence of one or more cryptic branch points. These polymorphisms were in linkage disequilibrium (D\u2019 = 0.65) in the population studied, resulting in four haplotype alleles that form nine observable genotypes (diplotypes) (Tables B and C in S1 File).",

These SNPs are placed in non-coding putative regulatory region (3\u2019UTR and intronic regions respectively). Functional characterization of these SNPs can be seen in Table A in S1 File. The results suggest that these polymorphisms are placed in regulatory regions (TF binding sites as well as in sites of histone enhancer sites marks in several tissues), and alleles present different affinity for protein-DNA interaction (i.e. alternate C allele in both polymorphisms reduce the predicted affinity with proteins RXRA, SETDB1, Znf143, Myb when compared to wild allele T). The profile expression of interactive proteins (RXRA, SETDB1, Znf143, Myb) was evaluated in The Human Protein Atlas [11]. All the proteins showed a high expression level on the respiratory tissue, except Myb transcription factor, which presents a medium expression level. Taken together, our results suggest that rs113350588 and rs1048479 may alter the function of ST3GAL1 either directly through splicing regulation alteration and/or indirectly through LD with SNP with regulatory function.",

In this pandemic, the fact that the incidence of severe disease was higher among young adults than among individuals older than 50 years called attention [14] and differed from observations made during annual epidemics caused by other human viral subtypes [15].",

Multivariate analysis demonstrated an association between the GC and AT haplotypes and severity or death due to the infection. Expression levels of sialyltransferase genes are known to differ according to tissue and type of cell, permitting regulation of the cellular pattern of sialylation and anticipating a complex specificity of these enzymes [17]. The enzyme encoded by ST3GAL4 gene which transfers the sialic acid chain to a galactose residue, forming beta-galactoside alpha\u20132,3-sialyltransferase 4 (Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc), serves as a cell entry receptor of influenza H5N1. The expression patterns of this enzyme differ between tissues of the respiratory tract and also show interpersonal variability, influencing differences in the rate of infection with this virus in a population [18]. Similarly, higher expression of the Sia\u03b12-6Gal(NAC) receptor was observed in the lung tissue of a young patient without comorbidities who died, when compared to three other patients who died and had important risk factors for severe infection with Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 [19].",

The GC and AT haplotypes of the ST3GAL1 gene were more frequent in patients who died and determines a higher risk to this outcome. The presence of these haplotype variants should influence the expression or structure of Sia\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21- receptors in cells of the lower respiratory tract, facilitating entry of the virus into tissues and increasing viremia which, in turn, can lead to more severe presentation of the disease and can culminate in death.
