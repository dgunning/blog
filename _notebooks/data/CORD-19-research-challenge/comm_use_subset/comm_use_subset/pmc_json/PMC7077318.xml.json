            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which was first observed in Europe in 1971 [1], belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae and causes severe diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and high mortality in neonatal piglets, resulting in severe agricultural loss [2,3]. Since PEDV was first identified, outbreaks have been reported in many swine-producing countries, notably in Europe and Asia. Before 2010, several commercial vaccines were widely used to control the spread of PEDV in Asia [2]. However, since 2010, frequent outbreaks of highly virulent strains of PEDV have occurred in Asia, and these outbreaks have been particularly severe in China [4,5,6]. The vaccines based on classic strains failed to control infection [2]. Furthermore, a vaccine-resistant PEDV strain emerged in the United States for the first time and spread rapidly throughout the country, causing large economic losses in the swine industry [3]. Subsequently, North America, Europe and Asia have also been attacked by a new PEDV strain [2,7]. Although newly developed vaccines provide efficient protection, vaccine resistance may still appear in the future due to the genetic diversity of epitopes among different virus genotypes [8]. Thus, it is necessary to develop other strategies to protect against PEDV infection.",

            "text": "Like all the other coronaviruses (CoVs), PEDV has a RNA genome that encodes two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab [9,10,11]. The majority of synthesized polyproteins are cleaved by 3C-like protease (3CLpro; main protease, Nsp5) at 11 conserved sites, which are essential for viral replication [10,12,13]. Thus, 3CLpro is an appealing target in the design of anticoronavirus therapies [14,15,16,17,18]. Notably, the 3CLpro proteins of different coronaviruses share higher sequence identity and have a more conserved catalytic core than the spike proteins of the same coronaviruses [19,20,21,22], which makes 3CLpro an ideal broad-spectrum antiviral target [23,24,25,26]. Furthermore, two highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), that both came from animals made people aware of the importance of the cross-species transmission of coronaviruses [27,28,29,30]. Since people have easy access to swine, the potential for cross-species transmission of PEDV should not be ignored. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new anti-PEDV therapies.",

Research breakthroughs in 3CLpro structures have made it possible to design specific inhibitors against coronavirus replication, and some of these inhibitors show excellent broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus effects [17,23,25,26,31,34,35]. GC376, a dipeptidyl bisulfite adduct salt, exerts an excellent inhibitory effect on some picornaviruses and coronaviruses in enzymatic or cell-based assays [35,36,37]. Notably, antiviral treatment with GC376 leads to a full recovery in laboratory cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a highly fatal feline disease caused by feline coronavirus (FIPV) that has no commercial vaccines or drugs [18]. In addition, PEDV 3CLpro shares a 62% sequence identity with FIPV 3CLpro.",

The EC50 values of GC376 against CV777 and YN144 were similar, namely, 11.18 \u03bcM and 14.63 \u03bcM, respectively (Figure 2). The results imply that GC376 should efficiently inhibit the replication of different PEDV strains, possibly because of the conserved catalytic core of 3CLpro. It is also notable that YN144 caused a cytopathic effect (CPE) much faster than CV777 (12 h and 36 h respectively); however, GC376 showed similar inhibitory effects with different treatment times for the two viruses, which indicates that GC376 quickly enters the cell and blocks viral 3CLpro.",

Investigation into the substrate-binding site revealed a prominent electron density for GC376 in two monomers, especially in subunit A (Figure 4A). The interface area between the PEDV 3CLpro and GC376 was 373 \u00c52, and the buried surface of GC376 took up 76% of the total solvent-accessible area (computed using the PDBePISA tool, http://pdbe.org/pisa/). As the 6-membered aromatic ring of GC376 occupied the place of the PEDV 3CLpro substrate P3 residue, whose side chain usually points to the solvent, it contributed little to the interface (Figure 4B). The glutamine surrogate ring and the leucine of GC376 fit comfortably into the S1 and S2 binding sites, respectively. However, in subunit B, there was no density for the 6-membered aromatic ring of GC376, and only part of the density was available for the glutamine surrogate ring (data not shown). These detailed interactions were analyzed using PyMOL and the LigPlot+ program (Figure 4). The bisulfite group of GC376 was removed, and the compound formed a covalent bond with Cys 144. Hydrophobic interactions were extensive between the protease and the compound (Figure 4D). Four residues of the PEDV 3CLpro, Cys 144, His 162, Gln 163 and Glu 165, are involved in the hydrogen bond interactions with GC376 (Figure 4C,D).",

This finding indicated that no large conformational change in the overall structure occurred upon ligand binding. However, examination of the substrate-binding pocket between chains A and B of the PEDV 3CLpro-GC376 complex revealed a structural difference in the loop composed of residues 44\u201352 (ASSTTSTID). Interestingly, there was only electron density (contoured at 1.0 \u03c3) for the 46\u201348 residues (STT) of chain A but not for chain B. This result suggests that the part of the loop is flexible and that its orientation directly influences the entrance size of the substrate-binding pocket. Thr 47 in the loop and Asn 141, which is located on another side of the binding pocket, both protrude into the pocket, forming a narrow entrance with the width of ~8 \u00c5 (Figure 4B).

As P1-Q is the most conserved residue of the PEDV 3CLpro recognition sequence, there may be few possibilities to introduce modifications at this site, or doing so may be difficult. In examining all the P2 residues of the cleavage site in the PP1ab, two different residues were observed (Val and Met). To determine the preferred P2 residues of PEDV 3CLpro, fluorescent peptide substrates with different P2 residues were synthesized. Except for Val and Met, several other residues with different side chain sizes were introduced into the substrates (Figure 5B). FRET assays using the different substrates were performed as described above. The original substrate without P2 mutation exhibited the highest cleavage efficiency. P2-M showed a little decrease, and P2-I and P2-V retained 60% activity. Furthermore, a large reduction of approximately 70% compared to that of P2-L was observed for P2-P/Y/ F/W.

We compared the binding between the PEDV 3CLpro\u2013GC376 complex and TGEV-3CLpro\u2013GC376 complex. Most of the residues forming the substrate-binding pocket were conserved, and the two 3CLpros showed a highly similar binding mode for GC376 (Figure 6A). The RMSD values of the most listed residues between the two proteases were approximately 0.4 \u00c5, and three residues from a loop (T47, I51 and Y53) showed RMSD values higher than 1 \u00c5 (Figure 6B). Some of the nonconserved residues, such as Q163 of the PEDV 3CLpro and H163 of the TGEV 3CLpro, formed similar hydrogen bonding interactions between the main chain oxygen and GC376. Overall, there were two relatively obvious differences: a. the loop (46-49) was stable, and water-mediated contacts were observed between Thr 47 and GC376 in the TGEV 3CLpro\u2013GC376 complex, which have also been found in the norovirus (NV) 3CLpro and picornavirus (PV) 3CLpro in complex with GC376 [35]; however, the loop (46-49) was flexible, and only hydrophobic interactions were observed in the PEDV 3CLpro-GC376 complex. b. The Asn 141 residue, which has a side chain that protrudes into the pocket, resulted in a narrower entrance in the PEDV 3CLpro than that in the TGEV 3CLpro, which has an Ala 141 residue instead (Figure 6). The two differences cause small structural deviations in the Leu side chain and the 6-membered aromatic ring of GC376 between the two structures, respectively. At the same time, the differences influenced the size of the entrance to the pocket, which might affect the efficiency of the entry and release of the 3CLpro substrate.",

The seven residues that differ between the CV777 and YN144 strains were not involved in the binding pocket and thus had no obvious influence on the antiviral effect. GC376 exhibits potent antiviral activities with high nanomolar EC50 values against TGEV and FIPV [35,49]. However, we obtained low micromolar EC50 values against both PEDV strains. We analyzed the binding details of the PEDV 3CLpro-GC376 complex and another available 3CLpro-GC376 structure from another coronavirus (TGEV). However, most of the residues involved in GC376 binding are conserved. Only the loop (46-49) and entrance size show some differences (Figure 6). However, considering that the activities of these proteins at the biochemical level are not as different as those at the cellular level, the structural differences may not be the only reason for the difference in GC376 antiviral activities between PEDV and TGEV (or FIPV) observed in the cellular assays. The antiviral effect is more complicated at the cellular level and may be affected by the expression level of 3CLpro, other viral replication characteristics, or the pharmacokinetics of GC376 in different host cells.",

In FRET assays using peptide substrates with different P2 residues, P2-M with a longer side chain and P2-I/V with shorter side chains showed lower cleavage efficiency (Figure 5B). This suggests that the length of Leu fits best in the S2 subsite. P2-P/F, which have a larger pyrrolidine or benzyl side chain group, resulted in a great increase in activity, which indicates that the residue with a side chain volume larger than that of Leu is not acceptable at the S2 subsite, further proving that P2-Y/W with even larger side chains are almost uncleavable (Figure 5B). Two modified compounds, Target 1 and Target 2, both showed lower inhibitory effects compared to that of GC376. GC376 (L-M) had stronger effects than GC376 (L-P) (Figure 5C,D), which was consistent with the results of FRET-based P2-site specificity assays. In conclusion, Leu of GC376 was the most preferred group in the S2 subsite, and we could rationalize the design of it based on Leu in the future. Perhaps replacement of one of the hydrogens of the Leu side chain by other atoms that causes minor changes might produce stronger binding, thus resulting in better inhibition. The 6-membered aromatic ring of GC376 stretches into the solvent and may not serve as a primary modification site.",
