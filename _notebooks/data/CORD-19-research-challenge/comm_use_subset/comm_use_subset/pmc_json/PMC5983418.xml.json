APP is the etiologic agent of this disease. The murine model for APP respiratory tract infection has been experimentally developed to evaluate the efficacy of vaccines [1]. According to previous studies, this model is a far less laborious and resource intensive than the standard porcine model[2, 3]. 15 serovars have been reported over the past several decades, and a new serovar 16 was reported in 2017[4, 5]. Traditionally, protection obtained from immunization has been serovar-specific; vaccines have typically lacked cross protective ability between different serovars[6]. As a result, vaccines had to be made from prevalent serovars within a given region, and have proven to be of little use in other areas where different serovars predominate [6]. Multivalent inactivated vaccines against APP have incorporated antigens from many serovars, and thus are more useful across multiple regions. Multivalent vaccines were shown to provide limited cross protection and partially reduced the incidence of the disease [7, 8].",

            "text": "To improve the performance of first generation inactivated vaccines, other targets have been studied recently [9, 10]. The most promising vaccine candidates are cross protective antigens; typically these are immunogenic markers of pathogens highly conserved across multiple serovars [11]. Virulence factors of APP like Apx toxins, lipopolysaccharide, and capsular polysaccharides have been studied as cross-protective vaccine candidates [10, 12, 13]. ApxI, ApxII and ApxIII have proven to provide cross protection against different APP serovars [7, 10, 12]. ApxIV is another Apx toxin that possesses strong antigenic properties, the gene of which is conserved across all 16 known serovars of APP. A recombinant rApxIVN has been shown to induce a high level of antibodies and confers strong protection against challenges with different APP serovars[10]. Antigens that are conserved across many serovars of a given pathogen could be considered as potential components in cross protective vaccine development. Most microbial pathogens are isolated and cultured on artificial media (in vitro) in a clinical setting[14, 15]. Many virulence genes, including those that code for highly antigenic virulence factors, are inducible and expressed only in vivo [16]. Additionally, in vivo study of pathogens in hosts provides an opportunity to investigate humoral and cellular immune responses to infection. Many experimental methods have been developed for studying and targeting in vivo-induced genes such as signature-tagged mutagenesis (STM), in vivo expression technology (IVET), selective capture of transcribed sequences(SCOTS), all of which have been widely used to screen antigens of microbial pathogens [17\u201319]. These technologies have proven to be powerful tools in efforts in the development of cross reactive vaccines [20].",

In recombinant protein GALT group, the level of GALT specific IgG was elevated both after initial and booster immunizations. In APP1 and APP5 immunization groups, there was no GALT specific IgG detected (Fig 4).",

Antibacterial agents have been viewed as the first choice to treat the diseases caused by bacteria. However, the reported abuse and overuse of antibacterial agents is selecting for an ever-growing population of resistant pathogens, including APP [41\u201344]. The use of vaccines has proven to be a better choice in efforts to control PCP outbreaks. Apart from use of traditional inactivated vaccine, many studies have focused on new vaccines to control PCP [45\u201352]. GALT was demonstrated as an efficient antigen against APP, and could be taken as a potential vaccine candidate [36]. A different APP serovar 1 isolated strain MS71 was used in this study to analyze the cross-protection effects of recombinant protein GALT.

The similarities between each two APP strains in this study range from 78.9% to 100% and that between L20 and MS71 is 83.1%. It is reported that PlpB across different P. multocidas strains exhibited a high level of homology (80.8%-99.4%), and the mice anti-rPlpB sera was cross-reactive with several P. multocida strains [53].

The outer membrane protein, LamB, of Vibrio alginolyticus was also demonstrated as an effective cross protective antigen, which showed cross-reactivity [55]. ApfA, VacJ and PalA of APP were also studied for their potential as vaccine candidates.
