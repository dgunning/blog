In the last 12 years three major pandemic threats, not all caused by influenza virus, affected public and healthcare professionals\u2019 perceptions of the need for influenza vaccine (IV) uptake. These pandemic threats were severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, \u201cavian influenza\u201d (influenza A (H5N1)) in 2005, and the recent influenza A (H1N1)2009 pandemic. The rapid worldwide dissemination of SARS in 2003 was a rehearsal for the next influenza pandemic\n[7]. In 2005, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the emergence and persistence of influenza A (H5N1) in birds and the associated human fatalities were a public health threat and fostered early response strategies to contain the pandemic\n[8]. In April 2009, the spread of novel swine flu origin influenza A (H1N1) prompted the declaration of a pandemic by WHO in June of the same year\n[9]. Whether this raised awareness had a positive or negative effect on IV uptake varies according to country and to situation\n[6,10,11].",

Using the same sample for more than one consecutive season could lead to biased coverage estimates. Specifically, the application of the questionnaire to the same sample in two consecutive seasons could lead to a greater proportion of individuals who choose to be vaccinated the next season. This change in behavior could artificially increase IV coverage, which would not represent coverage in the general population. There is no evidence of this bias in our study, because in each population group, IV coverage increase was not consistent or systematic for the four periods between changes in the sample population (1998 to 2001, 2002 to 2005, 2006 to 2009, and 2010 to the present).",
