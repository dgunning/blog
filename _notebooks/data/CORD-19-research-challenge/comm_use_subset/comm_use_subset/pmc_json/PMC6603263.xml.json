The demographic makeup of the KPSC membership closely mirrors the racially and sociodemographically diverse Southern California population and the California census population; more than 99% are community dwelling [16]. As KPSC is a prepaid healthcare system, there is a very strong motivation for members to use services internally. Furthermore, reimbursement by KPSC for outside care requires that claims be submitted with documentation of the care provided; claims are subsequently entered into the administrative data systems. Thus, capture of care delivered to KPSC members by electronic data is very comprehensive.",

All samples were submitted to a single, centralized KPSC laboratory for processing. Participants were required to have continuous KPSC membership for at least 6 months (allowing a 31-day gap) prior to the hospital admission date to allow for ascertainment of baseline characteristics. If there were patients with multiple hospitalizations who met the above criteria (eg, had a positive RSV or influenza A/B test on 2 separate hospitalization encounters), the first RSV or first influenza hospitalization was kept for the RSV or influenza cohort, respectively. For the purpose of statistical comparison, independent samples of RSV and influenza cohorts were defined. Twenty-five individuals with both a positive RSV test and a positive influenza test during different hospitalizations during the study period were kept in the RSV cohort and removed from the influenza cohort. Nineteen individuals coinfected with RSV and influenza during the same hospitalization were excluded from the comparison. The KPSC Institutional Review Board reviewed and approved the study.",

There was a higher proportion of females in the RSV cohort than in the influenza cohort (60.5% vs 50.3% female; P < .001). Race/ethnicity distributions were similar between the RSV and the influenza cohorts. A higher proportion of RSV patients than influenza patients had received influenza vaccine in the 1 year prior to admission (83.1% vs 73.1%; P < .001).

            "text": "Consistent with earlier reports, we found that adults hospitalized with RSV were slightly older and had greater frequency of baseline comorbidities, particularly cardiopulmonary disease, than those hospitalized with influenza virus infection [6, 12, 14]. However, after adjustment for comorbidities, we found that hospitalization outcomes among older adults hospitalized with RSV were either comparable to or significantly worse than they were among those hospitalized with influenza. While previous studies found similar hospital length of stay among older adults hospitalized with RSV or with influenza [6, 14], we found that longer hospitalizations (length of stay \u22657 days) occurred more often among the RSV cohort than they did in the influenza cohort. This may reflect increased use of antiviral therapies in recent years that ameliorate influenza but not RSV disease [18] or differences in clinical recovery associated with a more pronounced RSV-associated severe lower respiratory tract syndrome. We also found that pulmonary complications and findings, including pneumonia, tachypnea, hypoxia, and greater need for oxygen supplementation, and exacerbation of asthma and of COPD, chronic bronchitis or emphysema were significantly greater among the RSV cohort after adjustment for potential confounders. These findings are similar to those of Lee et al. who reported that hospitalized adults with RSV in Hong Kong had a greater frequency of lower respiratory complications than those with influenza [14]. While increased baseline cardiopulmonary disease in the RSV cohort likely increased their risk of pulmonary complications, including exacerbation of chronic respiratory disease and asthma, these differences were observed after adjustment for comorbidities, including baseline cardiopulmonary disease. Discharge to hospice and skilled nursing facilities was similar in the RSV and influenza cohorts, but a greater proportion of the RSV cohort required home health services after discharge. Finally, similar to previous findings [6, 14], short-term mortality for patients infected with RSV was similar to that of patients infected with influenza. However, longer-term survival among the RSV cohort, which has not been reported previously, was significantly worse than that of the influenza cohort. The impact of RSV on long-term survival may be a reflection of the potential for RSV to drive chronic inflammation associated with persistent, sometimes progressive, pulmonary disease, although the mechanism for this is not clear [19\u201322]. In addition to confirming the severe impact of annual influenza epidemics, our findings also underscore the substantial morbidity, mortality, and healthcare utilization associated with RSV infection in the expanding population of older adults and the need for RSV vaccines and antivirals.",

This may reflect, in part, the effectiveness of influenza vaccine in preventing influenza infections and is unlikely due to differential vaccine acceptance. On the other hand, the increased use of oseltamivir within 14 days prior to hospitalization among older adults hospitalized with RSV compared to those hospitalized with influenza may reflect presumed influenza infection and delay in diagnosis of RSV infection. Conversely, decreased in-hospital use of antiviral therapy among the RSV cohort compared to the influenza cohort likely reflects the discontinuation of oseltamivir after identification of RSV and initiation of oseltamivir after identification of influenza. The greater use of antibiotics and systemic and inhaled steroids in the RSV cohort during their hospitalizations may mirror the higher frequency of pneumonia and exacerbation of chronic lung disease and asthma among older hospitalized adults with RSV infection than those with influenza infection.",

            "text": "Whereas RSV has long been recognized as a cause of serious illness among young children, its role as a significant pathogen among older adult patients appears to be underrecognized by many adult providers [7\u20139]. This is understandable since in many settings, respiratory pathogen testing is limited to influenza virus testing, so that noninfluenza pathogens, including RSV, have not been recognized as possible etiologies of serious respiratory illness similar to that caused by influenza. In addition, even in settings in which multiplex pathogen testing is used, local circulation of influenza virus in the community and clinical suspicion for influenza may drive testing patterns among hospitalized older adults and, thus, may underestimate the relative frequency of other viral respiratory pathogens, including RSV, which may have either nonoverlapping or broader periods of circulation in the same community. Therefore, the number of hospitalizations with RSV or with influenza detected in this study may not reflect the relative incidences of each pathogen over the study period since RSV infections that occur during intervals when influenza virus is less prevalent are less likely to be detected.",
