The virus is an arbovirus and circulates between mosquito vectors and ruminants in endemic areas. RVFV causes high mortality rates in young ruminants and a high rate of abortions in pregnant ruminants [1]. Humans are infected with the virus either by mosquito bite or by direct contact with materials of infected animals. The majority of patients show influenza-like symptoms but few develop hemorrhagic fever, neurological symptoms, and ocular disease [2]. Due to its major impact on public health, RVFV is classified as a category A priority pathogen by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Currently there is no approved vaccine available for humans and animals in non-endemic areas.",

RVFV is an enveloped virus and carries 3 segmented RNA genomes, the L, M and S segments, which are of negative or ambisense polarity. The L segment encodes L protein, a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. M RNA encodes 78kDa protein, NSm protein, Gn protein and Gc protein, the latter two of which are major envelope glycoproteins and generated by co-translational cleavage of precursor Gn/Gc polyprotein. 78kDa protein is dispensable for virus replication [3], whereas it plays important roles in virus dissemination in mosquitoes [4, 5]. NSm is a viral anti-apoptotic protein [6, 7] and also is important for efficient virus replication in macrophage cell lines [5]. S RNA expresses a nucleocapsid (N) protein and a nonstructural protein NSs by using an ambisense coding strategy. The N protein encapsidates the viral RNA and forms a ribonucleocapsid complex with L protein [8].",

            "text": "RVFV NSs protein is a phosphoprotein with an apparent molecular weight of 31 kDa and is localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus [9]. In the nucleus, NSs forms filament-like structures by self-dimerization through its C-terminal domain [10]. RVFV NSs protein is a major virus virulence factor and has various important biological functions, which are important for countering the host antiviral response. One of the NSs functions is suppression of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA transcription. NSs binds to Sin3-associated protein 30 (SAP30), a subunit of a co-repressor complex, and maintains IFN-\u03b2 promoter in a transcriptionally silent state, leading to suppression of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA transcription [11]. In addition to the specific inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 transcription, NSs suppresses general transcription; it has been proposed that NSs exerts suppression of general transcription by interacting with subunits of transcription factor II H (TFIIH) complex, p44 and p62 [12, 13]. A recent study showed that the NSs-mediated general transcription inhibition contributes to the inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA transcription [14]. Although NSs-mediated transcription suppression has been considered to be important in suppressing the host antiviral response, the exact effects of the NSs-mediated general transcription inhibition on virus virulence have not been defined. NSs promotes the degradation of double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR), an antiviral IFN-stimulated gene product, through a proteasome pathway to prevent phosphorylation of eIF2-\u03b1 triggered by RVFV infection [15\u201318]. Furthermore, NSs contributes to cellular stress responses such as an increase in reactive oxygen species, activation of DNA damage signaling, cell cycle arrest, and activation of the p53 signaling pathway [19\u201322]. Although how NSs induces the cellular stresses remains largely unknown, these stress responses may contribute to RVFV-induced cell death.",

However, introducing any short in-frame deletion in the RVFV NSs resulted in loss of all functions [23], suggesting to us that the NSs protein structure is important for its biological activity. Hence, it has been challenging to generate NSs mutants that lack a specific biological function but retain its other functions. The lack of these NSs mutants has prevented a detailed mechanistic analysis of each biological function of the NSs. In this study, we generated two RVFV mutants, each carrying mutations in NSs, that specifically targeted its general transcription inhibition function, to delineate the mechanism of its inhibition by NSs. Furthermore, we examined the importance of the NSs-mediated inhibition of general transcription on virus-induced cytotoxicity and tested its role in RVFV virulence by using a young mouse model.",

To obtain virus variants, carrying mutations that can compensate for this deficiency, we serially passaged this mutant virus in type I IFN-incompetent Vero E6 cells; the virus inoculum, used for each passage, was diluted 10 times and the released viruses were harvested at 4 days p.i. The titer of the mutant virus progressively increased with each passage; at passage 18, the virus titer was 2.9 x 106 PFU/ml, which was 2 logs higher than the initial titer of 2.0 x 104 PFU/ml prior to the serial passage. We isolated 34 plaque-cloned viruses from passage level 18, and 28 had a large deletion in the NSs gene in the S segment, whereas 6 plaque-cloned viruses retained the full-length NSs gene. We determined the full genome sequence of 5 clones that retained the full-length NSs gene and found that all of the isolated viruses had several mutations in the L, M, and S segments. Table 1 shows mutations found in the NSs genes of 5 plaque-cloned viruses and the uncloned passage 18 virus. All five plaque-cloned viruses and the passage 18 virus had an amino-acid substitution at position 250, including M250K or M250T mutations. Two plaque-cloned viruses and the passage 18 virus had a D100G substitution. Other mutations found in plaque-cloned viruses were R16H and A75E.

In contrast, ActD-treated cells showed very weak fluorescent signals, demonstrating ActD-mediated host transcriptional shut-off. MP-12-infected cells showed weaker fluorescent signals in the nucleus, compared with those in MP-12\u0394NSs-infected cells, demonstrating an inhibition of host transcription by NSs. Fluorescent intensity observed in cells infected with virus carrying mutation M250T, R16H or A75E in NSs was similar to that in MP-12-infected cells, suggesting that host transcription was still inhibited by these NSs mutants. In contrast, cells infected with MP-12 carrying NSs-R16H/M250K (MP-12-R16H/M250K) had bright fluorescent signals, whose intensities were similar to those in mock-infected cells or MP-12\u0394NSs-infected cells.

Cells, transiently expressing a V5-tagged SAP30, were infected with these viruses, and the co-localization of the mutated NSs protein with SAP30 was examined by fluorescence microscopy analysis.

We also performed co-immunoprecipitation analysis to examine NSs-SAP30 interaction. As a negative control, V5-tagged Venus was expressed in place of V5-tagged SAP30. Anti-V5 antibody co-precipitated wt NSs and both NSs mutants along with V5-tagged SAP30, while the amounts of NSs-M250K that were co-immunoprecipitated with SAP30 were lower than those of wt NSs (Fig 5D).

Anti-p44 antibody co-immunoprecipitated wt NSs and both mutant NSs along with p44, whereas control anti-H2K antibody precipitated neither p44 nor NSs. These data demonstrated that both NSs mutants bound to p44.

Anti-p62 antibody, but not anti-H2K antibody, co-immunoprecipitated wt NSs and both mutant NSs along with p62, demonstrating binding of the mutant NSs proteins to p62. We noted that the amounts of NSs-M250K that were co-immunoprecipitated with p44 and with p62 were lower than those of wt NSs, implying that the binding efficiencies of NSs-M250K for p44 and for p62 were lower than those for wt NSs.",

NSs-R16H/M250K, which completely lacked the activity to inhibit general transcription, correspondingly lost the ability to promote the degradation of p62. Unexpectedly, NSs-R16H/M250K was able to interact with FBOX3 and p62 (Fig 6). These data possibly suggest that the FBXO3-NSs-p62 interaction may not be sufficient to trigger p62 degradation. NSs-M250K exhibited a partially reduced activity to inhibit general transcription. The results of co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that a reduced amount of NSs-M250K co-precipitated with SAP30, p62 and p44, compared with that in wt NSs (Figs 5 and 6). However, the slightly impaired ability of NSs-M250K to inhibit general transcription could not be solely attributed to the lower binding efficiency of NSs-M250K to p44 because NSs-M250K efficiently suppressed IFN-\u03b2 transcription and induced p62 degradation, despite its lower efficiency of binding to SAP30 and p62. Moreover, NSs-R16H/M250K, which lacked transcription suppression activity, efficiently interacted with p44 (Fig 6). These data bring into question the importance of NSs-p44 interaction for its host transcriptional shut-off function. One possibility is that the NSs-p44 interaction may only make a modest contribution towards its transcription inhibition activity and possibly could have additional, as yet unidentified, biological function(s). A second possibility is that only wt NSs, but not the mutated NSs, is able to interfere with the formation of an active TFIIH complex. NSs competes with XPD for binding to p44, resulting in inhibition of the TFIIH complex formation [12]. Although both NSs-M250K and NSs-R16H/M250K retained the ability to bind to p44, it is possible that the binding of these mutated NSs to p44 did not exclude the binding of XPD.",

It has been reported that NSs-induced p62 degradation contributes to the inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 production [14]. Accordingly, our data suggested that MP-12-R16H/M250K was unable to completely block IFN-\u03b2 mRNA synthesis due to a lack of ability to promote the degradation of p62 (Fig 6). Although MP-12-R16H/M250K replication induced IFN-\u03b2 mRNA synthesis, the level of the IFN-\u03b2 mRNA was significantly lower than that in MP-12\u0394NSs-infected cells (Fig 5), suggesting the importance of interaction of NSs with SAP30 for IFN-\u03b2 inhibition.

As shown in Fig 3, MP-12-infected cells showed the lowest cell viability, followed in order by MP-12-M250K, which moderately suppressed host general transcription, and MP-12-R16H/M250K, which did not suppress host transcription.

Notably, both the NSs mutants, carrying either the M250K single mutation or the R16H/M250K double mutation, retained the ability to bind to SAP30, the factor that is targeted by NSs to inhibit IFN-\u03b2 mRNA transcription. However, the induction of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA synthesis was not completely blocked in MP-12-R16H/M250K-infected MRC-5 cells, most probably due to the lack of inhibition of host transcription in these cells expressing the mutated NSs. These data suggest the possibility that the inability of MP-12-R16H/M250K to completely block the production of IFN-\u03b2 in infected mice could have contributed towards its attenuation. In addition, the production of other antiviral and/or proinflammatory cytokines could have also contributed towards the attenuated phenotype of both of these mutant viruses, carrying NSs with an impaired ability to block host transcription. It is also possible that the lower levels of virus-induced cytocidal effects might have contributed to the lower virulence of these NSs mutant viruses, as both mutant viruses caused less severe cytopathic effects and cytotoxicity than did MP-12 in cultured cells (Fig 3). We believe that experiments using RVFV mutants, carrying the M250K single mutation and the R16H/M250K double mutation, in animal models would yield valuable information about the role of NSs-mediated host transcription inhibition in regulating host cytokine responses and its impact on the pathogenesis of RVFV. MP-12 is an attenuated live vaccine candidate, but it still harbors residual virulence in a young mouse model. Although further studies are required to test the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of MP-12-M250K and MP-12-R16H/M250K, there is a potential for developing these MP-12-derived NSs mutant viruses as safer live attenuated RVFV vaccine candidates.",

            "text": "We found that the serial passage of an MP-12-derived mutant virus having a large deletion in the 5\u2019 untranslated region of M RNA segment [30] in Vero E6 cells resulted in accumulation of variant viruses that were able to replicate better than the original mutant virus. Most of viruses in passage 18 had a large internal deletion in the NSs gene, which may mean their NSs proteins are biologically inactive. Others have reported that RVFV carrying large deletions in the NSs gene start accumulating from the 15th serial passage in BHK cells of the RVFV P strain, which is defective in IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling [35]. In our experiment, the large deletions in the NSs gene were detected after the 5th serial passage of the virus. Although the cell lines used in the studies were different, the deletion of the NSs gene as early as after 5 passages implied that there was a selective pressure to remove the NSs gene from the virus genome during the passaging of the mutant virus. The full-length NSs gene of the uncloned passage 18 viruses had M250K, M250T, K202N and D100G mutations (Table 1). In the cells infected with MP-12 carrying NSs with a D100G mutation, the accumulation of NSs was poor (Fig 1), indicating that the D100G mutation affects the efficient accumulation of NSs. As two out of the five plaque-cloned viruses (clones 3 and 4, Table 1) also had the D100G mutation in NSs, this possibly affected its accumulation in infected cells. The remaining three clones carried NSs with a M250K or R16H/M250K mutation. Our results showed that these mutations in NSs partially or completely abolished its host transcription inhibition function without affecting its ability to interact with SAP30 to inhibit IFN-\u03b2 mRNA synthesis. These data implied that the host transcription function of NSs was unfavorable for the mutant virus, carrying a deletion in the 5\u2019 UTR, to replicate well in VeroE6 cells. MP-12-M250K and MP-12-R16H/M250K replication induced low cytotoxicity due to its lower inhibitory activity on host transcription (Figs 2 and 3). We suspect that the lack of NSs-induced host transcription suppression created a favorable cellular environment for the mutant virus, thereby allowing the emergence and accumulation of mutant viruses that lacked this function. Further studies are required to delineate the importance of NSs-mediated host transcription inhibition in the virus life cycle.",
