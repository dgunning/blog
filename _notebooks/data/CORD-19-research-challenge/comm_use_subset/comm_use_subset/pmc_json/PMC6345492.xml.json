Endemic in more than 100 countries [2,3], the virus is estimated to cause 390 million infections each year [4]. DENV infections can result in serious diseases including dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), dengue shock syndrome (DSS) and even death [5]. There are no approved antiviral drugs for these diseases and currently, patients are treated with supportive care to relieve fever, pain, and dehydration [6]. A tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDENV or Dengvaxia), the first dengue vaccine has recently been registered in several countries [7]. Despite being a leading cause of hospitalisation and death among children in some Asian and Latin American countries [8], this vaccine is not recommended for use in children under 9 years of age due to safety concerns [7]. Therefore, there exists an urgent need for antiviral therapies to treat dengue.",

The virus genome is encoded by three structural proteins (C, prM, E) as well as seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5) [11].

Twenty-four compounds were found as in silico hits based on the free energy of binding (\u0394Gbind) ranking from a total of 1990 compounds. Twenty of them were obtained from NCI for in vitro assay, out of which four demonstrated moderate inhibition towards DENV-2 NS2B/NS3pro (IC50 = 29\u201377 \u03bcM). Although Diversity0713 (D0713) is not the most potent compound identified in the virtual screening, the structure contains thioguanine (TG or 6-thioguanine) scaffold can be used as a template to develop a series of analogues as its simple chemical structure benefits feasible synthetic steps. TG showed 56% inhibition at 200 \u03bcg/mL (1.2 mM) indicating that even without any modification to the structure, the scaffold itself is able to inhibit the protease activity. This compound is a drug classed as anti-neoplastic agent and used with other compounds in treating leukemia [40] and has been investigated in many pharmacological activities such as immunomodulators in autoimmune diseases [41] and transplant graft rejection [42]. From this initial study, we are interested to utilise thioguanine scaffold in the design of DENV-2 NS2B/NS3pro inhibitor(s). Thus, in this study, we designed, synthesised thioguanine analogues and investigated their possible DENV-2 NS2B/NS3pro inhibition activity. We hope that this study could contribute to the efforts in discovering novel and potent anti-dengue agents.",

The 24 top hit compounds were investigated for their interaction with the active site\u2019s residues and ranked in term of the free energy of binding (\u0394Gbind = -10 kcal/mol to -5 kcal/mol, see S1 Table. We identified that there are more than 50 ligands docked into the active site with that \u0394Gbind range, but only 24 of them shows interesting interactions with the essential amino acid residues. The selection of \u0394Gbind range is adopted from the study reported by Shityakov (2014) that Gibbs free energy of binding < 6.0 kcal/mol is clustered as active when this prediction is highly correlated with the experimental results with R2 = 0.880; F = 692.4 standard error of estimate = 0.775 and p-value = 0.0001 [58]. This virtual screening study has a limitation in which no decoy database is being used to validate the docking protocol. The non-binding molecule could be selected over the true ligand called as false positive. Decoy database is the false positive hits which may improve the validity of the test by generating the true positive rate as well as enrichment factor. Unfortunately, the decoy for this DENV-2 NS2B/NS3pro has not been available in a database of useful decoy (DUD dude.docking.org), therefore, the validation of this virtual screening only relies on internal control docking and by in vitro assay [59]. Fig 1 shows the overlay of all 24 compounds docked into the active site of the protease. Most of the ligands bound to NS3pro, but there are two ligands (D1099 and D1343) also interacting with NS2B, particularly at Ser83.",

TG, a known drug used with other compounds in treating leukemia [40] has also been investigated in other pharmacological activities such as in autoimmune diseases [41] and transplant graft rejection [42]. In addition, its simple chemical structure also benefits feasible synthetic steps, thus, TG is selected as a template to develop a series of analogues. Therefore, in order to test our hypothesis, TG was subjected to the protease inhibition assay and it was found that the molecule showed 56% inhibition at 200 \u03bcg/mL (1 mM) indicating that even without any modification to the structure, the scaffold itself is able to inhibit the protease activity. Thus, TG was chosen as the lead structure in the design and synthesis of potential anti-dengue compounds.",

High activity of 18, 19 and 21 towards DENV-2 NS2B/NS3pro (IC50 of 0.38, 54 and 16 \u03bcM, respectively) could be due to this mimic of peptide character. Compound 18 with pentanamide chains at both R1 and R2 possessed the highest activity against the protease. However, attaching benzyl group at R2 (19) dramatically decreased the activity from 0.38 to 54 \u03bcM. Interestingly, attaching benzyl group at R3 significantly increased the activity to 16 \u03bcM. Compounds 16 and 17 have amide group extended by shorter alkyl chains showed moderate activity with IC50 = 97 and 80 \u03bcM, respectively.

The thioguanine scaffold is composed of pyramidine and imidazole rings attached to an amine and a thiol group which may contribute to the compound\u2019s activity. As far as we are aware, no report of pyrimidine inhibition to DENV-2 NS2B/NS3pro, however, 2-(benzylthio)-6-oxo-4-phenyl-1,6-dihydropyrimidine has been reported to demonstrate an activity against SARS-CoV-3C like protease [61]. In addition, pyrimidine has also been shown to actively stop the growth of DENV-2 but it relies on the capability of pyrimidine to inhibit dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), an enzyme required for viral pyrimidine biosynthesis [62]. Imidazoles have also been investigated against dengue virus [63] however the exact molecular mechanism or which protein they target is still unknown. The 6-thioguanine scaffold has been reported to non-competitively inhibit ubiquitin specific protease in various cancers [64]. With this background, we postulated that thioguanine derivatives might potentially be good inhibitors against DENV-2 NS2B/NS3pro.",

In the docking study, the amide group is marked as a HBD with N-amide interacts with O-phenol of Tyr161 (in 18) and Asn152 (in 21) via H-bond. Previously, amide, such as \u03b1-ketoamide [65], arylcyanoacrylamide [66], and aminobenzamide [67] has been incorporated in the design of DENV NS2B/NS3pro inhibitors. The alkyl chain of 18 and phenyl-benzyl group of 21 demonstrate hydrophobic features and agreeable to docking results which show that these groups bound at the hydrophobic pocket surrounded by Val154, Ile86, Met84 and Val155.

The thioguanine moiety is facing toward His73 and Tyr183 for 18 and 21, respectively. Compound 18 has an acyl group at R2 which provides additional electron lone pair enabling the formation of hydrogen bonds that can strengthen its binding towards NS2B/NS3pro. This reflected clearly in the hydrogen bond analysis where 18 formed more hydrogen bonds as compared to 21. Regardless of the slightly lower absolute binding energy from the MM/PBSA prediction, the binding interaction analysis of 18 with NS2B/NS3pro agrees well with experimental results. The absolute free energies of binding for both two active compounds are also more negative than panduratin A supporting the in vitro results in which compound 18 and 21 better IC50 value (0.38 and 16 \u03bcM, respectively) than panduratin A (56 \u03bcM).",

From the virtual screening of National Cancer Institute Database, four compounds including D0713 were observed to have moderate inhibition activity on the protease. D0713 has a thioguanine scaffold in its structure prompting us to consider the scaffold for designing the new thioguanine derivatives as potential DENV-2 NS2B/NS3pro inhibitors. Fifteen compounds were synthesised and the bioactivity against dengue protease showed variation in inhibition activity from inactive to moderately active (1000>IC50>18 \u03bcM). Based on this information, a further design of six new compounds was conducted by concentrating on the attachment of amide group. All the compounds showed inhibition activity against the dengue protease with compound 18 being the most potent (IC50 of 0.38 \u03bcM). This result agrees well with the MM/PBSA calculation which showed that the interactions are mainly contributed by polar and non-polar interactions. Hydrogen bonding analysis demonstrates the importance of amino acid residues Asn174 (occupancy 60%), Asp75 (8.22%), Tyr183 and Ser157 (2.85 and 2.73%). This is further supported by the experimental results which showed that 18 could be further developed as DENV-2 NS2B/NS3pro inhibitor. It is hoped that the results obtained from this study could be used in designing more active compounds as potential dengue protease inhibitors.",
