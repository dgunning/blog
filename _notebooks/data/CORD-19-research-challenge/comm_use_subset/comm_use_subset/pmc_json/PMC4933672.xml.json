The elderly are particularly susceptible to emergent or \u2018never\u2010before\u2010seen\u2019 pathogens, such as the West Nile virus (WNV) (Murray et al., 2006), severe acute respiratory syndrome (Leung et al., 2004) and chikungunya virus (Borgherini et al., 2007). Vaccine efficacy is also dramatically decreased in the elderly (McElhaney, 2002). Despite the presence of other factors, including, but not limited to, changes in microbial colonization with aging, the reduced function of barrier tissues, and hormonal, proteostatic, metabolic, and other changes with aging, it is believed that a common and variable decline in immunity, called immune aging or immune senescence, decisively contributes to these changes. Both innate and adaptive immune systems are affected by aging (rev. in Haynes & Swain, 2012; Kogut et al., 2012; Nikolich\u2010Zugich, 2014). Age\u2010associated T\u2010cell defects include decreased na\u00efve T\u2010cell (TN) abundance and proportional increase in memory cells, reduction in proliferation and function (rev. in Maue et al., 2009; Haynes & Swain, 2012; Nikolich\u2010Zugich, 2014), and inability to defend against intracellular infections (Brien et al., 2009; Smithey et al., 2011; Jiang et al., 2013). Pathogen\u2010specific antibody production and efficacy also decrease with age (Frasca & Blomberg, 2009; Kogut et al., 2012).",

However, some of the arrested cells did not die, nor repair to re\u2010enter cell cycle. Rather, they survived for prolonged periods of time and, similar to the phenotype described by Hayflick on fibroblast doublings in culture, were deemed to be \u2018senescent\u2019 (Hayflick & Moorhead, 1961). From there, a subset of theories of biological aging suggested that many cells, including immune cells, may have defective functions in old age because of a lifetime of self\u2010renewal and DNA damage\u2010related senescence (Hasty et al., 2003; Campisi, 2005; d'Adda di Fagagna, 2008; Lopez\u2010Otin et al., 2013). However, the role of DNA damage in biological aging (excluding its obvious and critical importance in disturbing genome integrity and precipitating cancer) remains incompletely understood. Specifically, if DNA damage repair is the key and limiting mechanism in longevity and biological aging, one would expect that gain\u2010of\u2010function DNA repair mutants would extend maximal lifespan and that human longitudinal studies would demonstrate associations between increased maximal lifespan and superior DNA repair. Such evidence, however, has been scant and difficult to come by so far, with one recent study showing an increase in lifespan following overexpression of antioxidating enzyme that excludes 8\u2010oxoguanine from nucleic acids (De Luca et al., 2013) and with no human longitudinal data published as yet to the best of our knowledge. It is therefore important to assess how resilient is the DNA repair system and whether and how it combines with biological aging to produce measurable phenotypes.",

Hematopoietic cells are amongst the most radiosensitive cells in mammals and lymphocytes are among the most sensitive hematopoietic lineage cells. In mice, hematopoietic cell death is detectable at WBI doses of 0.5 gray (Gy), and severe systemic depletion is induced in the 4 Gy range (Anderson & Warner, 1976), with lethal outcome occurring between 7 and 10 Gy depending on the strain (Grahn & Hamilton, 1957). Specifically, C57BL/6 (B6) mice are estimated to be about twice as radioresistant as humans, in whom the same effects occur at half the doses mentioned above (rev. in Nias, 1990).",

While the kinetics of immune repopulation have long been known (Takada et al., 1969), long\u2010term immune homeostasis, function, and protection following repopulation remain relatively uncharacterized, particularly in humans. Hiroshima and Nagasaki bomb survivors were reported to display some hallmarks of increased or early immune aging (Nakachi et al., 2004; Yamaoka et al., 2004; Hayashi et al., 2005; Kusunoki & Hayashi, 2008). However, it is unclear whether these hallmarks translate directly into increased risks from new or emerging infections, and whether vaccination efficacy against such infections is significantly reduced.",

We then followed the animals longitudinally into the old age to examine immune response to a single\u2010cycle live vaccine, RepliVAX West Nile (R\u2010WN) (Widman et al., 2009), and protective immunity following a subsequent challenge with a potentially lethal dose of live West Nile virus (WNV). In unmanipulated mice, R\u2010WN vaccination is sufficient to provide strong protection to both adult and old mice against lethal WNV challenge (Uhrlaub et al., 2011), providing a good baseline with which to measure the potential exacerbation of immune aging\u2010induced by DNA damage. We found that, perhaps contrary to the expectations predicted by the DNA damage aging theories, a single WBI exposure in youth did not decrease late\u2010life survival from WNV challenge following vaccination. Vaccine and WNV\u2010specific immunity, including T\u2010cell and antibody responses, were not substantially affected by WBI dose in youth. Therefore, a single dose of nonlethal WBI in youth, resulting in widespread DNA damage and repopulation stress in hematopoietic cells, leaves no significant trace of increased immune aging and decreased immune function and protection in a lethal vaccine challenge model. These results are encouraging from the standpoint of defined, accidental exposure to sublethal ionizing radiation of the immune system.",

To test these hypotheses, we employed the experimental strategy outlined in Fig. 1. Age\u2010matched, adult, male B6 mice were divided into groups receiving 0, 1, 2, or 4 gray (Gy) of WBI in a single dose. (Another group of animals irradiated at 0.5 Gy was initially used in our first set of experiments, but that dose subsequently abandoned because it showed no substantial difference from 1 Gy group.) Mice were allowed to rest for 72 h, and six randomized mice from each group were euthanized to confirm systemic hematopoietic cell death in a WBI dose\u2010dependent manner across primary and secondary organs. No mice died as a result of WBI exposure at these doses, as would be expected from the WBI LD50/30 of this strain (Grahn & Hamilton, 1957). Another cross\u2010sectional harvest of representative mice from each group was collected at ~13 months of age, long after complete repopulation of immune cells. In addition, immune populations in peripheral blood were tracked at 3\u2010month intervals from WBI until 19 months of age. At 19 months of age, mice were injected with RWN vaccine, which we have previously shown to protect old mice from WNV (Uhrlaub et al., 2011). We examined effector responses to the vaccine, allowed for immune memory to form and mature for 60 days, and then challenged the mice with a potentially lethal dose of live WNV. During vaccination and challenge, WNV\u2010specific T\u2010cell and antibody immunity were assayed. This design was completed on two independent large cohorts of mice (Fig. 1).",

We recently demonstrated that these irradiation doses cause the expected DNA damage, including histone marking by ATM kinase, in all assessed T\u2010cell and other nucleated blood cell subsets (Pugh et al., 2014). While we did not directly assess the damage to hematopoietic cells, our irradiation dose was carefully controlled by calibration and dose absorbance (Pugh et al., 2014; Seed et al., 2016) and was in the range documented by others to cause hematopoietic stem cell damage (Mohrin et al., 2010).",

At 30 days post\u2010WBI, populations of CD4 and CD8 TN cell counts remained depressed relative to nonirradiated controls (Fig. 2G,H). Similarly, B\u2010cell counts in PBMC had not fully recovered by 30 days (Fig. S2C). Radioresistant NK cells, however, had fully repopulated by 30 days following WBI (Fig. S2D). Typical declines in CD4 and CD8 TN cells were observed with aging in mock\u2010irradiated mice (Figs. 2A and 3B). These declines were accompanied by slight increases in the total counts of central memory CD8 T cells (CM), and effector memory CD8 T cells (EM) over lifespan (Fig. S2G,H). However, counts of CD8 and CD4 TN cells from irradiated mice were not depressed relative to mock\u2010irradiated controls by 19 months of age (Fig. 2G,H). There also were no significant differences by 19 months of age in peripheral counts of CD8 CM, CD8 EM, nor \u03b3\u03b4T cells among the groups, regardless of irradiation in youth (Fig. S2F\u2013J). Counts of B cells in PBMC were depressed among mice that received 4 Gy in youth, relative to all other groups, by 19 months of age. However, B\u2010cell counts for that group also remained within the range of natural variation over lifespan (4 Gy mean at final time point = 5249 cells, 0 Gy range at initial time point 2410\u20107406 cells) (Fig. S2D). Of importance, the extent of DNA damage, as judged by the histone marking (\u03b3H2\u2010AX), was unremarkable and did not differ with the dose of radiation exposure in youth in any of the T\u2010cell subsets examined (na\u00efve, central, and effector memory, Fig. S3).",

On d7 postvaccination, absolute numbers of NS4b tetramer\u2010positive (NS4b+) CD8 T cells in all old groups of mice were significantly reduced compared with adult mice, confirming our previous observations (Uhrlaub et al., 2011) that primary responses against R\u2010WN are drastically reduced in old mice (Fig. 3A). However, we found no difference between the groups of old mice based upon the presence or dose of irradiation in youth \u2013 NS4b+ cells were equivalently abundant in the blood of old mice receiving no irradiation compared with mice receiving 1\u20134 Gy WBI (Fig. 3A).

Again, we found no difference in numbers of memory CD8+ NS4b+ cells between old control and 1\u20134 Gy irradiated mice at any irradiation dose used here (Fig. 4A). Similarly, functional humoral memory response against the virus assessed in the serum 45 days postvaccination showed no difference in old mice based on the dose of irradiation in youth (Fig. 4B). This was concluded based upon the analysis of the neutralizing potential of WNV\u2010specific antibodies using a plaque reducing neutralizing titer (PRNT) assay. While adult vaccinated mice showed on average 40\u2010fold higher PRNT titers compared with old nonirradiated counterparts, similar to our original observations (Uhrlaub et al., 2011), WBI dose in youth did not significantly alter the neutralizing potential of serum antibody generated by RWN vaccination in old mice (Fig. 4A). Finally, 45 days postvaccination, PBMCs were harvested and stimulated with WNV peptides recognized by CD8 T cells in the presence of Brefeldin A to evaluate the function of memory CD8+ cells (Fig. 4C,D). No significant differences were noted across WBI doses with regard to individual cytokine production (Fig. 4C), although Granzyme B levels exhibited a trend toward reduction at the highest irradiation dose (4 Gy). Similarly, percentages of cells producing multiple cytokines (polyfunctional cytokine production) mounted against WNV\u2010specific peptides were not different between the groups (Fig. 4D).",

The obtained results were exceedingly consistent and clear, and we conclude that a single, widespread DNA damage and repopulation stress in haematopoietic cells does not lead to increased aging immune phenotypes in mice. Because WBI applies DNA damage to both immune and nonimmune cells, our experimental design theoretically addresses both direct and systemic relationships between DNA damage and immune aging. Although increased unrepaired DNA damage correlates with aging in some hematopoietic populations (Nijnik et al., 2007), and DNA damage can cause senescence and inflammation in a variety of cell types (Rodier et al., 2009; Chandler & Peters, 2013), no immune aging effect was replicated by WBI alone in the present studies. There are several possible not mutually exclusive explanations for this observation. These are: (i) that the sum total of DNA damage is not a cause of immune aging, (ii) that the youthful capacity of DNA repair and apoptotic mechanisms are able to repair and nullify even severe DNA damage in early life, or (iii) that the response to gradual DNA damage that occurs over lifespan is fundamentally different than the response to DNA damage delivered by a single dose of WBI, and that only the former is of importance during aging. Experimental analysis with repeated, low\u2010level exposure to DNA damage will be necessary to test and distinguish between these hypotheses.",

These studies document similarities in HSC senescence between natural aging and WBI in youth, among other nonimmune phenotypes. Unfortunately, neither group tested immune function nor challenged reconstituted immune systems in vivo. Both studies employ higher doses of WBI than in our present study, in conjunction with HSC transfer models, reconstituting irradiated HSCs in lethally irradiated hosts. While this model is necessary for the focused study of HSCs, it unfortunately adds many confounding covariables to a direct comparison between natural immune aging and WBI exposure. For instance, we observed strong peripheral immune cell division and reconstitution in our model, even in Na\u00efve T cells (Fig. S4), which would not be present in an HSC transfer model. Indeed, this factor may have led to irradiated populations having slightly higher counts of Na\u00efve T cells in old age (Fig. 2). Taken together with our results, this suggests that WBI, although able to replicate senescence in HSCs and some nonimmune cell types, fails to additively impact other systemic immune aging phenotypes. A combination of HSC reconstitution and in vivo challenge models will be necessary in future studies to resolve some of the remaining issues.",

However, the response to vaccine by old na\u00efve NS4b+ cells was not further degraded by WBI up to 4 Gy. We did not note any increase in standing DNA damage in peripheral lymphocytes following repopulation (Fig. S3A), implying that either the surviving precursor cells with DNA damage were not contributing to repopulation, or that DNA damage was adequately neutralized through division/differentiation and apoptosis. We independently examined the increase in standing DNA damage by \u03b3H2AX in peripheral immune cells with age. No CD8 T\u2010cell subset exhibited increased standing dsDNA breaks with age (Fig. S3B), implying that standing DNA damage is not a major intrinsic factor in T\u2010cell aging defects, at least not within the limits of our experimental design and detection sensitivity.

A cross\u2010sectional harvest of representative mice from each group was collected at 3 days following WBI. A similar cross\u2010sectional harvest occurred at 13 months of age, long after complete repopulation of immune cells. Immune populations in peripheral blood were tracked at 3\u2010month intervals from PBMC until 19 months of age. At 19 months of age, mice were injected with 105 pfu RWN vaccine i.p. Immune function and antibody generation were assayed 45 days postvaccination. Sixty days postvaccination, mice were challenged with 2000 pfu WNV i.p. and mice were tracked for survival. This experimental design was completed in its entirety on two separate cohorts of mice, with birthdates separated by approximately 1 year.",
