PED is caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which was firstly identified in Belgium in 1978 [2]. PEDV is an enveloped, single-strand, and positive-sense RNA virus, which belongs to the Coronaviridae family [3]. The PEDV genome is ~28 kb in length and comprised of a 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), a 3\u2032 UTR, and at least seven open reading frames (ORFs) that encode four structural proteins [spike (S),envelope (E), membrane (M),and nucleocapsid (N)] and three non-structural proteins(replicase 1a and 1b, and ORF3) [4].",

So far, PEDV has been observed on most swine breeding farms in most provinces since late 2010 in China [5].The economic losses caused by PEDV infection have been continuous and serious in China [6]. Recently, PEDV has suddenly emerged in the United States and rapidly spread across the country, resulting in high mortality in infected newborn piglets, which have posed serious economic losses to the swine industry in the USA [7, 8]. Rapid diagnosis and timely monitoring of potential PED outbreaks are among the first important steps in the prevention and control of PED. Currently, several conventional methods are available for the detection of PEDV, including virus isolation, fluorescence assay, immune electron microscopy, enzyme-linked immuno- sorbent assay and molecular biological characterization [9]. However, the isolation and identification of viruses require extended periods of time ranging from days to weeks; so this method does not meet the time requirements needed for the prevention of epidemics. Therefore, these rapid, sensitive and specific molecular biological techniques, including RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR, have played important roles in the rapid detection of PEDV [10]. Nevertheless, all of these techniques require sophisticated instrumentation (such as PCR machines and quantitative fluorescence PCR machines), limiting the effectiveness of these procedures in smaller, under-equipped laboratories.",

This method only requires a water bath or heating block to amplify large amounts of nucleic acids in 30 ~ 60 minutes without additional expensive equipments [12]. In addition, there is no need to use nucleic acid electrophoresis to assess the result, for the reason that the result can be easily observed in the presence of a fluorescent dye [13]. These characteristics make the LAMP method a simple, fast, effective and practical DNA amplification method, which has been successfully implemented for the detection of avian influenza A viruses [14], porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus [15], foot-and mouth disease virus [16] and PEDV [17]. The PEDV M protein, the most abundant envelope component, is a triple-spanning membrane glycoprotein with a short amino-terminal domain outside of the virus and a long carboxy-terminal domain inside [18]. The M protein plays an important role in the virus-assembly process, and induces antibodies that neutralize the virus in the presence of its complement [19]. In this study, five primer sets were designed based on the conserved regions of the M gene, and a real-time RT-LAMP method was developed for the detection of PEDV.",

The reaction conditions of the the real-time RT-LAMP were optimized by selecting primers sets and performing the test at different temperatures. Subsequently, its sensitivity was compared with that of one-step RT-PCR. The real-time RT-LAMP assay was able to detect PEDV with a detection limit of 10\u22121 TCID50/mL, which equals to a virus titer of 0.07 PFU (Fig. 3a). The 104.0 TCID50/mL PEDV had an RNA viral load of 106.846(7.02 \u00d7 106) copies. The results showed that the specificity of real-time RT-LAMP for PEDV was approximately 100-fold more sensitive than that of one-step RT-PCR. Moreover, the sensitivity between real-time RT-LAMP and real-time RT-PCR was compared using the same PEDV RNA template. The real-time RT-LAMP had a similar sensitivity with real-time RT-PCR. Four clinical samples were determined to be PEDV negative by one-step RT-PCR, but the real-time RT-LAMP was able to detect them as PEDV positive. The results further suggested that the real-time RT-LAMP assay was slightly more sensitive than one-step RT-PCR for the detection of the PEDV M gene. The developed PEDV M gene real-time RT-LAMP method has a higher sensitivity (10\u22121 TCID50/mL) than the RT-LAMP method developed for N gene with detection limit 100.75 TCID50/ml, which was determined to be more sensitive than gel-based RT-PCR and ELISA in previous study [17].",

For comparative purposes, conventional RT-PCR methods based on N and M genes were both constructed.

Therefore, the pair of primers based on N gene (JQ743655, named P1 and P2) designed to amplify a 428-bp fragment was utilized in further study. The primers and probes used for real-time RT-PCR targeting N gene were listed in Table 2 [25].
