The respirator must fit tightly to wearer\u02bcs face with limited seal leakage to be effective. Medical masks, also known as surgical masks, are used to protect the wearers from microorganism transmission, specifically during hand-to-face contact and large droplets and sprays. In fact, the comparably loose wearing of medical masks does not efficiently prevent the entry of small airborne particles. Both masks and N95 respirators are used to protect against airborne viral pathogens such as SARS-CoV and influenza virus. Therefore, it has been reasonable to initiate widespread mask and respirator protocols across China when facing a coronavirus similar to SARS-CoV.",

In fact, the clinical effectiveness of N95 respirators compared with medical masks in protecting against respiratory infection transmission has not been fully assessed. Particularly, quantified protection analyses among healthcare individuals close to patients suspected of respiratory illness are limited.7 In a randomized clinical trial of 2,862 healthcare personnel that analyzed the effectiveness of N95 respirators and medical masks, Radonovich et al8 reported no significant difference in the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza between these 2 types of equipment. Notably, disease-bound features remain another uncertainty limiting the direct translational protective implementation. Experience with the influenza A virus may offer an explanation.2 The altered specificity of influenza virus-targeting receptor has resulted in a changing disease burden due to a shift from the lower to the upper respiratory tract. The H1N1 virus targets the upper respiratory tract, with endemic populations and comparably mild disease, whereas H7N9 targets the lower respiratory tract, with fewer cases of human-to-human transmission.2 However, without sufficient mechanistic evidence, whether this lesson can be translated into COVID-19 remains unknown.",

A previous review of published literature, including 67 randomized controlled trials and observational studies, indicated that surgical masks and N95 respirators were supportive measures offering the most consistent protection.9 However, these reviewers also concluded that the assessment of such measures was difficult.9 With the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become necessary to widely implement supportive protection using masks or N95 respirators, which may subsequently enable further multiregional or multinational studies on these issues. Notably, Holshue et al10 reported the first case of COVID-19 in the United States from a stool specimen that tested positive using a real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay.",
