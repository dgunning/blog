The subsequent identification of a large pool of coronaviruses circulating in bats and other animals portended the appearance of other highly pathogenic CoVs3, and in 2012 the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV caused a similar outbreak with a higher mortality rate4. Severe SARS-CoV infection manifests clinically as acute lung injury associated with high initial virus titers, macrophage/neutrophil accumulation in the lungs. and elevated proinflammatory serum cytokines (IL-1, IL-18, IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1)5\u20138. Recent advances have implicated inflammatory monocyte-macrophages (IMMs) in the lungs as critical mediators of SARS-CoV pathology, as a delayed type I interferon response promotes high initial virus titers and aberrant IMM recruitment9. Host disease is likely a combination of direct viral damage and consequences of an aberrant immune response promoted by IMMs9, underscoring the importance of determining the mechanisms by which the virus targets innate immunity.",

            "text": "The SARS-CoV is an enveloped, positive-strand RNA virus that encodes a set of accessory proteins, several of which target the innate immune response. Open reading frame (ORF) 8a and ORF9b trigger cellular apoptosis; ORF7a activates nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB); ORF3b upregulates the expression of several cytokines and chemokines; ORF6 limits interferon production; ORF3a induces necrotic cell death; and ORF8b induces cellular DNA synthesis and suppresses the expression of the viral envelope protein10,11. Recently, we found that ORF9b localizes to mitochondrial membranes and reduces mitochondrial-associated adapter molecule MAVS, severely limiting the interferon response12. Of note, ORF8b is of interest as ORF8 encoded a single polypeptide during the early phase of the SARS epidemic, while in the later stages a 29-nucleotide deletion split it into two ORFs, ORF8a and ORF8b. They encode 39- and 84-residue polypeptides respectively. The splitting of ORF8 is thought to confer evolutionary advantage to the virus, and accordingly virus expressing ORF8b is better able to replicate in the presence of interferon10,13.",

            "text": "Initially, two studies had difficulty expressing the ORF8b protein, suggesting it may be rapidly degraded in cells14,15. However, antibodies raised specifically against the ORF8b protein detect low levels of expression as early as 8 h (h) post infection, while expression is prominent by 24 h16. Immunostaining ORF8b after expression in Vero E6 cells localized it to cytosolic punctate vesicle-like structures reminiscent of intracellular aggregates17. Here, we investigate the cellular mechanisms by which ORF8b contributes to SARS-CoV pathology. We report that ORF8b forms intracellular aggregates dependent on a valine at residue 77, which contributes to the induction of lysosomal stress, autophagy, and eventual cell death. Given the importance of IMMs in SARS-CoV pathology, the link between intracellular aggregates and inflammasome activation18, and the observation that SARS-CoV infected patients have elevated serum levels of IL-1 and IL-1819, we tested whether ORF8b might affect inflammasome activation in macrophages and lung epithelial cells. We found that ORF8b triggers robust NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1\u03b2 release. NLRP3 activation was accompanied by direct binding of ORF8b to the LRR domain of NLRP3. In sum, this study suggests that ORF8b activates cell stress pathways by forming intracellular aggregates and may be important in the aberrant activation of macrophages during SARS-CoV infection.",

Analysis of the ORF8b sequence predicted a tendency to aggregate based on a carboxy-terminal VLVVL motif (aa 75\u201379), while re-analyzing the ORF8b sequence with V77 mutated to K (V77K) reduced its predicted propensity to aggregate (Fig. 1a). To empirically test the aggregation tendency of ORF8b, we expressed GFP-ORF8b (GFP-8b) in Hela cells overnight and imaged the transfected cells by confocal microscopy. While some cells had a homogenous pattern of expression, other GFP-8b expressing cells showed intracellular patch and fiber aggregation patterns (Fig. 1b). Quantification showed a considerably higher percentage of cells with intracellular aggregates in GFP-8b expressing cells than GFP vector (GFP) expressing cells (Fig. 1c). Presumably, the homogenous expression of GFP-8b precedes the development of intracellular aggregates. These findings were replicated in A549 cells, a human lung epithelial cell line (Fig. 1b).",

Thus, we separated the triton soluble and insoluble fractions of HeLa cells expressing either GFP, GFP-ORF8b, or mutant GFP-8b V77K to determine if ORF8b forms insoluble aggregates. To separate these fractions, we lysed the cells in a Triton-X based buffer and spun down the resultant lysates at 14,000 rpm for 10 min (min). The supernatant was collected and considered the triton soluble fraction, while the pellet was reconstituted in an LDS based buffer and heated at 100 \u00b0C for 30 min. While preparing the triton insoluble fraction, we consistently observed that addition of LDS and heating for 30 min was unable to completely solubilize the pellet from GFP-8b expressing cells, but completely solubilized the pellet from GFP and GFP-8b V77K expressing cells. Accordingly, analysis of each fraction by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting for GFP showed considerable monomeric and oligomerized GFP-8b in the insoluble fraction, while significantly less monomeric and almost no oligomerized protein was seen in the GFP-8b V77K insoluble fraction (Fig. 1d). The control GFP was undetectable in the insoluble fraction and seen only in the soluble fraction (Fig. 1d). Moreover, we observed consistently less GFP-8b V77K expression in the soluble fraction compared to GFP-8b, indicating that GFP-8b\u2019s ability to aggregate may be protective against degradation (Fig. 1d).",

Confocal imaging showed that aggregated GFP-8b caused ER dispersion as assessed by immunostaining for ERp72 (Fig. 2a). The expression of GFP did not affect the usual juxta nuclear localization of the ER while expressing GFP-8b disrupted the usual ERp72 localization. Immunoblotting showed greater CHOP induction after transfection of GFP-8b than either GFP or GFP-8b V77K (Fig. 2b), indicating that GFP-8b forms protein aggregates dependent on its valine 77. As intracellular protein aggregation is toxic once the aggregates overwhelm cellular homeostatic mechanisms, we looked at cell death by Trypan blue uptake following expression of GFP, GFP-8b, and GFP-8b V77K. Expression of GFP-8b induced significantly more cell death than did GFP, while the GFP-8b V77K was partially protective (Fig. 2c). Taken together, this data suggests that GFP-8b forms insoluble protein aggregates and that can cause cell death, which at least partially depends on its ability to form intracellular aggregates.",

Formation of intracellular protein aggregates can disrupt this pathway, as aggregated proteins are poorly degraded by lysosomes. Lysosomal protein buildup then results in lysosomal stress and compensatory activation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), the master transcriptional regulator of autophagic and lysosomal machinery25,26. To determine if ORF8b disrupts autophagic and lysosomal homeostasis, we expressed GFP-8b and mCherry-galectin 3 in HeLa cells followed by imaging via confocal microscopy. Under homeostatic conditions galectin-3 is localized diffusely throughout the cytosol, but rapidly forms puncta on lysosomes following lysosomal stress/damage27. Accordingly, GFP expressing cells showed diffuse cytosolic galectin-3 distribution, while many GFP-8b expressing cells showed clear galectin-3 puncta formation, some of which co-localized with GFP-8b (Fig. 3a).",

Confocal microscopy of GFP-8b expressing cells showed large, prominent lysosomes as assessed by LAMP1 immunofluorescence (Fig. 3d). However, we noted only moderate overlap between the LAMP1 immunostaining and the GFP-8b aggregates. TFEB nuclear translocation following both ER and lysosomal stress has been reported to depend upon dephosphorylation of its S211 residue by the phosphatase calcineurin (PPP3CB)28\u201330. To determine the mechanism of TFEB activation in GFP-8b overexpressing cells, we immunoblotted endogenous TFEB following nuclear fractionation of GFP, GFP-8b, and GFP-8b V77K expressing cells. The GFP-8b expressing cells were treated or not with the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A. Again, GFP-8b induced TFEB nuclear translocation and increased LAMP1 expression, both of which were reduced by treatment with cyclosporin A. Expression of GFP-8b V77K did not increase nuclear TFEB levels or increase the level of LAMP1 in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 3e). These data indicate that ORF8b aggregates causes ER and lysosomal stress, which leads to the nuclear translocation of TFEB, and the upregulation of TFEB target genes.",

Expression of GFP-8b induced clear formation of RFP-LC3 puncta, while GFP did not (Fig. 4a). In some cells the RFP-LC3 defined autophagosomes strongly co-localized with the GFP-8b aggregates while in other cells many of the aggregates did not (Fig. 4a). An increase in LC3 puncta can be due to an increase in autophagosome formation or a decrease in autophagosome/lysosome fusion32. During autophagosome formation, LC3 is lipidated and converted from LC3-I to LC3-II. We expressed GFP or GPF-8b in the presence or absence of Bafilomycin A1, which blocks autophagosome-lysosome fusion, and immunoblotted the cell lysates for LC3. We found that the cell lysates from the GFP-8b and GFP expressing cells had similar LC3-II levels. However, bafilomycin A1 treatment increased the LC3-II levels in the GFP-8b expressing cells more than it did in the control cells (Fig. 4b). These results indicate that GFP-8b induces autophagic flux. Treatment with bafilomycin A1 increased the GFP-8b levels, but not GFP levels suggesting that ORF8b aggregates are partially degraded by the autophagy\u2013lysosome pathway. Taken together, the GFP-8b intracellular aggregates trigger cellular stress. This results in a calcineurin dependent activation of TFEB and TFEB target genes, which leads to an increase in autophagic flux.",

As SARS patients show increased serum IL-1\u03b2 and IL-187,8, we investigated whether ORF8b affects inflammasome activation in macrophages. To do so, we first attempted to generate a permanent cell line expressing GFP-8b in the human macrophage cell line THP-1 cells. While we easily established GFP expressing THP-1 cells, no cells survived the selection process when we attempted to express GFP-8b. This is likely secondary to the toxicity of the protein, as even attempts at using an inducible promoter failed to generate a useable cell line. Therefore, we switched to a transient transfection system. Evaluating inflammasome activation in macrophage cell lines following transient DNA transfection can be problematic as cytosolic DNA activates DNA sensing inflammasomes. However, we found that that by carefully titering the amount of DNA transfected, we could express the GFP vector and yet trigger minimal Il-1\u03b2 production. Therefore, we compared IL-1\u03b2 production by THP-1 cells transiently transfected with low amounts of the vectors producing GFP, GFP-8b, 8b-GFP, or GFP-8b V77K. We found that both GFP-8b and 8b-GFP increased the amount of IL-1\u03b2 present in the cell supernatant compared to GFP alone (Fig. 5a). Surprisingly, the GFP-8b V77K construct also enhanced IL-1\u03b2 production suggesting that the mechanism did not solely depend upon lysosomal stress (Fig. 5a). We also checked whether an alternatively tagged version could trigger IL-1\u03b2 production by expressing Flag tagged version of ORF8b. Similar to the results with the GFP-tagged ORF8b, we found that 8b-Flag induced 3-fold more Il-1\u03b2 than did the Flag vector (Fig. 5b). A complementary approach to assess inflammasome activity is to reconstitute the requisite components in HEK293T cells. Therefore, we transfected HEK293T cells with expression vectors for NLRP3, caspase-1, ASC, and full-length IL-1\u03b2 in the presence of GFP or GFP-8b. A similar experiment was performed using FLAG or 8b-FLAG. In both instances we found an increase in IL-1\u03b2 in the supernatant and a decrease in full-length IL-1\u03b2 in the cell lysate in the presence of the ORF8b constructs versus the controls (Fig. 5c). These results suggest that ORF8b activates NLRP3 inflammasomes in macrophages and likely in monocytes.",

To assess the impact of GFP-8b on the localization of NLRP3, we expressed NLRP3-DsRed in HeLa cells in the presence or absence of GFP-8b. In the absence of GFP-8b NLRP3 expressed homogenously throughout the cytosol of transfected HeLa cells, however the presence of GFP-8b dramatically altered NLRP3 localization (Fig. 5d). We found that both proteins co-localized in the cytosol in small cytoplasmic dots as well as in a large perinuclear aggregate. We performed a similar experiment using HEK 293T cells (Fig. 5e). In the left panel the images show a HEK 293T cell expressing NLRP3 alone and one expressing both proteins, while the right panel shows another cell co-expressing NLRP3 and GFP-8b. We found that GFP-8b forms large aggregates in HEK 293T cells and that its expression disturbed the homogenous cytosolic pattern of NLRP3, and as we had observed with HeLa cells both proteins showed an overlapping expression pattern. We also checked the distribution of the trans-Golgi network in HeLa cells co-expressing GFP-8b and NLRP3-DsRed by immunostaining for TGN38 (Fig. 5f).

To test whether ORF8b might also interact with NLRP3, we transiently expressed 8b-Flag in PMA differentiated and LPS stimulated THP-1 cells and tested whether we could detect an association with endogenous NLRP3. We found that immunoprecipitated 8b-Flag pulled down endogenous NLRP3, while control immunoprecipitates did not (Fig. 6a). To characterize the region in NLRP3 domain responsible for the interaction, we examined the binding of Myc-tagged truncated NLRP3 proteins to 8b-Flag. In addition to full-length NLRP3, we used constructs that express NLRP3 with a deleted leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain (NLRP3\u0394LRR), a deleted Pyrin domain (NLRP3\u0394PYD), or deleted NACHT and LRR domains (NLRP3\u0394LRR\u0394NACHT). Following transient expression, 8b-Flag interacted with both full-length NLRP3 and the PYD domain deleted protein, but not the LRR and LRR/NACHT domains deleted proteins (Fig. 6b) To directly show that ORF8b interacts with the LRR domain of NLRP3, we expressed the NLRP3 LRR domain as a Myc tagged protein (amino acids 537\u2013991) and collected Myc immunoprecipitates following GFP-8b or GFP expression. We found GFP-8b, but not GFP in the Myc-immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6c). Next, we expressed the non-functional NLRP3 LRR domain and determined whether its presence affected the induction of mature IL-1\u03b2 secretion by ORF8b. We found that expression of the NLRP3 LRR domain impaired the production of mature IL-1\u03b2 after GFP-8b expression in inflammasome reconstituted HEK 293T cells (Fig. 5e), confirming the functional importance of this interaction. In summary, our data indicates that ORF8b activates the NLRP3 inflammasome and directly targets the NRLP3 LRR domain.",

Recent advances in mouse models have shown that SARS pathogenesis is driven by high initial virus titers resulting from a late interferon response, which drives aberrant recruitment of IMMs and activation of the innate immune response resulting in cytotoxicity9. Given the likelihood that ORF8b is evolutionarily adaptive for the virus10, it follows that ORF8b may contribute to SARS-CoV pathogenesis by impairing the host interferon response and/or targeting the innate immune system. While the former has been previously shown13, here we show that ORF8b activates intracellular stress pathways upon forming insoluble aggregates and directly targets innate immunity by activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.",

Protein aggregates have long been observed after viral infection; viruses are known to use aggregates as scaffolds for replication and/or for shielding from host degradation39. In our study, ORF8b appears to be degraded by the autophagy\u2013lysosome system, as treatment with bafilomycin A1 increases ORF8b levels. The aggregation ability of ORF8b may be protective against degradation, as we consistently observed that the anti-aggregation V77K mutant is expressed at lower levels than ORF8b. It has previously been reported that ORF8ab and ORF8b induce ER stress40, which is consistent with our findings showing accumulation of CHOP by ORF8b expression dependent on V77. We also find induction of lysosomal stress and activation of TFEB by ORF8b. Both ER stress and TFEB have been shown to propagate the inflammatory response, with TFEB directly promoting the transcription of inflammatory cytokines26,41,42.

The released IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 functions to promote host defense, but aberrant inflammasome activation can result in excessive inflammation and enhanced disease. Examples include the influenza encoded proton-selective ion channel M2 which provides signal 2 for NLRP3 inflammasome activation45, the encephalomyocarditis virus viroporin 2B which promotes the release of intracellular Ca2+ from intracellular stores also providing signal 246, and the pathogenic influenza A viruses which use PB1-F2 to activate NLRP3 inflammasomes47. Our findings indicate the SARS-CoV can activate NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages via ORF8b. While SARS-CoV abortively infects macrophages/monocytes, enough ORF8b may be present to impact lysosome integrity, autophagy pathways, and NLRP3 inflammasomes. In contrast to macrophages, the SARS-CoV productively replicates in lung epithelial cells. These cells also express NLRP3 and can assemble NLRP3 inflammasomes. In humans infected with the SARS-CoV the full impact of ORF-8b on the pathways we delineated in this study are likely in the lung epithelium. ORF8b may contribute to the cytokine storm and inflammasome activation that occurs during severe SARS-CoV infection. Moving forward, live virus deletion studies are required to assess the effects of ORF8b mediated intracellular aggregates and ORF8b mediated NLRP3 activation. However, here we identify novel mechanisms through which ORF8b may contribute to SARS pathogenesis.",
