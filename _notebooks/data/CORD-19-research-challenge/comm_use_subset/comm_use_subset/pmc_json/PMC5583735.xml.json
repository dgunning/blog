Equally important in the interests of developing vaccines and therapeutics is understanding how MERS-CoV actually causes disease, and this has driven extensive work on developing large and small animal models as well as studies of the molecular virus-host interactions that contribute to viral replication and virulence.",

Large-scale serosurveys suggest rare but widespread subclinical infection\n5, but it is unknown whether asymptomatically infected individuals can transmit the virus. Notably, seropositive rates among dromedary camels exceeding 90% have been detected in several sub-Saharan African countries in addition to the Middle East, but not a single active MERS-CoV infection has been identified in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2016, sampling of more than 1,000 individuals in Kenya identified two seropositive individuals\n6, although most of the individuals tested, including the two who tested positive, had little contact with camels. It is unclear whether the absence of cases reported in Africa is due to under-reporting or different ecology of the virus, but further, intensified sampling may fill these gaps.",

Extensive global surveys since the discovery of MERS-CoV have revealed a remarkably wide distribution of lineage C betacoronaviruses in bats, and lineage C betacoronaviruses have since been identified in bats in Italy\n8,\n9, Mexico\n10,\n11, and Thailand\n12. Most recently, a 2017 global study by Anthony\net al.\n13 found that 91 of the 100 phylogenetic coronavirus lineages identified in diverse mammalian orders were found in bats, suggesting that bats are a source of not only lineage C betacoronaviruses but possibly the vast majority of global coronavirus diversity.",

Analysis of the complete genome sequence of this virus (NeoCoV) by Corman\net al.\n17 revealed that it shares 85% nt identity with MERS-CoV across the entire genome and more than 90% amino acid identity, placing the two viruses within the same species. Most recently, a second virus (PREDICT/PDF-2180) in this species was described by Anthony\net al.\n18, further supporting the idea that MERS-CoV is descended from an ancestral virus of African bats. Despite the close similarity and conspecific classification of NeoCoV and PREDICT/PDF-2180 with MERS-CoV, the two bat viruses are highly divergent from MERS-CoV in the S1 subunit of the Spike glycoprotein (less than 45% nt amino acid identity), but highly similar to each other (91%), with evidence of recombination between the S1 and S2 subunits, and PREDICT/PDF-2180 was unable to infect human cells. This is consistent with the idea that MERS-CoV has a common ancestor with these viruses but itself arose through the acquisition of a new Spike S1 subunit conferring the ability to infect human cells through its receptor, DPP4\n18.",

Serological evidence of MERS-CoV infection in dromedary camels dates back to at least 1983. In 2014, M\u00fcller\net al.\n25 reported 81% seropositivity for MERS-CoV in banked dromedary serum samples obtained between 1983 and 1997 in Somalia, Sudan, and Egypt, the first two countries being major exporters of dromedary camels to the Arabian Peninsula. This supports extensive circulation of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels long predating known human cases. Corman\net al.\n26 reported similarly high seropositive rates in Kenyan camel serum banked in 1992, and contemporary serum collection shows that high percentages of dromedary camels are also seropositive for MERS-CoV in Nigeria, Tunisia, and Ethiopia\n27 as well as Burkina Faso and Morocco\n28. Phylogenetic analysis of MERS-CoV sequences suggests an evolutionary history of MERS-CoV in camels. Sabir\net al.\n29 isolated complete MERS-CoV sequences representing five genetic lineages from Saudi Arabian camels.

They found no significant differences in disease between MERS-CoV\u2013infected marmosets and marmosets inoculated with inactivated MERS-CoV, suggesting that the volume of the intratracheal viral inoculum itself might result in airway pathology. However, Yu\net al. infected solely by the intratracheal route, rather than through multiple routes as Falzarano\net al. did, and inoculated the marmosets with 10-fold less virus than Johnson\net al. did. Like Johnson\net al., Yu\net al. compared pathology in MERS-CoV infected marmosets and mock-infected marmosets, seemingly confirming the original finding by Falzarano\net al. that viral infection induces the observed severe pathology in MERS-CoV infected marmosets. Resolving the differences between these studies will require considerably more work, but in the interim, the common marmoset appears to be a useful model organism for studying the pathogenesis of severe MERS-CoV disease, while the rhesus macaque may be appropriate for studying milder, likely under-reported human disease as well as for vaccine studies.",

Notably, Matthews\net al. found that, although NS4b localizes primarily to the nucleus, deletion of the N-terminal nuclear localization sequence did not abrogate NS4b inhibition of IFN\u03b2 promoter-driven luciferase expression, a result confirmed by Yang\net al.\n63 in 2015. In that 2015 study, Yang\net al. expanded on their earlier work, showing that ectopically expressed NS4b inhibited IFN\u03b2 promoter-driven luciferase expression as a consequence of overexpression of the IFN activators MDA5, RIG-I, MAVS, IKK\u03b5, TBK1, IRF3, and IRF7. MDA5 and RIG-I are cellular sensors of viral dsRNA, whereas MAVS transduces their recognition of dsRNA through the kinases IKK\u03b5 and TBK1 to phosphorylate IRF3/7 and induce IFN. They demonstrate that NS4b associates with several of these antiviral proteins, preventing the formation of an IKK\u03b5/MAVS complex required to induce IFN, yet the authors identify, but do not characterize, an IFN antagonist function mediated specifically in the nucleus. Finally, in 2016\n64, we identified NS4b as a 2\u2032,5\u2032 phosphodiesterase (PDE) with structural homology to the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) NS2 protein as well as a larger host protein family known as 2H-phosphoesterases. We previously characterized MHV NS2 as an RNase L antagonist\n65 and showed that NS4b can functionally replace MHV NS2. Additionally, we used recombinant live MERS-CoV to demonstrate that a mutation in an NS4b catalytic residue (H182R) that abrogates its enzymatic activity results in RNase L activation in Calu-3 cells late during infection.",

Notably, the latter two models required mouse adaptation of the virus and still require 10- to 100-fold more virus to achieve severe disease. It is possible that full replacement of mDPP4 disrupts its non-MERS-CoV\u2013related functions, including T-cell homeostasis, that could affect the course of disease, and the use of different MERS-CoV strains may also affect outcome. A side-by-side comparison of these models will help in elucidating and reconciling these differences. With respect to pathogenesis, all three models appear to recapitulate the pneumonia observed in humans, but the model using wild-type virus may offer certain advantages. Particularly, it will better allow studies of naturally occurring and engineered mutations in viral proteins, on the genetic background of human isolates, particularly the accessory proteins in the 3\u2032 end of the genome. Several of these proteins have been identified\nin vitro as putative innate immune antagonists, and the potential to extend these studies to characterizing the role of these proteins in pathogenesis offers exciting opportunities for the field.",

None of the MERS-CoV accessory proteins shares significant amino acid identity or similarity with known coronavirus proteins, suggesting that their interactions with the host may be unique to the lineage C betacoronaviruses. In contrast, replicase and structural genes that interfere with the immune response do remain of interest but, owing to their conservation among coronaviruses, are less likely to act in unique or newly recognized ways. Although NS4a, NS4b, and NS5 have been reported to interfere with the innate immune response, most of this work, including that related to IFN induction, has been done using ectopically expressed protein and reporter assays. Exclusive use of ectopically expressed protein raises concerns about whether results may be skewed by non-physiological expression levels, mislocalization, or loss of possible interactions with other viral proteins. Although studies using live virus are more cumbersome and require biosafety level-3 containment, they are essential and feasible given the existence of multiple systems for generating recombinant MERS-CoV.",
