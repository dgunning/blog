The long history of bacterial infections occurring concurrently or shortly after influenza illness dates back to the 1918 influenza pandemic in which most of the fatal cases were found to be due to co-infection based on autopsy findings.5 More recently the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic was complicated by bacterial pneumonia in 4% to 33% of hospitalized or critically ill patients.6\u201311 Most commonly isolated co-infecting bacterial organisms with influenza are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. pyogenes, and Haemophilus influenzae.

In our study, severity of illness characteristics were identified as being the primary factors associated with in-hospital mortality among patients with viral pneumonia.

A potential explanation for this finding is that host characteristics enabling infection of multiple respiratory viruses may lead to worse outcomes. This finding may be a surrogate marker for immunocompromise or debilitation status of such patients and thus, their increased risk of death. However, it is also possible that co-infection with multiple viruses leads to a more pathogenic or detrimental respiratory process.",

Our study was not limited to community-acquired infections which may account for this disparity; however, other studies have also reported lower rates of bacterial co-infection.29,30 Additionally, it is unlikely that a higher incidence of healthcare-related infections would explain the lower rates of bacterial co-infection observed.",

Furthermore, antibacterial administration before respiratory culture obtainment was not evaluated and could have impacted rates of bacterial RCI seen. Second, patients transferred from an outside hospital may have had additional infectious processes identified by cultures taken outside of our hospital system. In such cases, co-infections may have been missed and falsely decreased the rates observed. Third, viral shedding may occur for several days to weeks after initial respiratory virus infection especially among immunocompromised patients. Our study classified viral pneumonia based on the index RVP report date and radiographic evidence of pneumonia. It is possible that for some patients the initial viral infection had occurred days before identification by RVP and that a concomitant process was detected on imaging. In this case, more bacterial RCIs would be classified as subsequent infections. Fourth, all cases in this study occurred in a 20-month period at a single institution. Viral epidemiology at this site and during this timeframe may not be representative of all seasons and locations. Finally, due to the constraints of the RVP used, we may have not identified all possible viral infections such as bocavirus.",

This study describes hospitalized adult patients with viral pneumonia and factors associated with in-hospital mortality. Identification of multiple respiratory viruses and several factors describing severity of illness were associated with in-hospital mortality in a multivariate model. Recognition of multiple viruses as a poor prognostic indicator is of interest. With increased ability to recognize viral pathogens, this finding could simply be the result of improved diagnostics. However, it may also be indicative of host factors allowing for simultaneous infection by multiple respiratory viruses. In this study, only 16.9% of patients with viral pneumonia had a bacterial RCI. Use of antibacterials in this setting was not evaluated, but future research should focus on the role of empiric antibacterial use in patients with only viral infection identified. Additionally, procalcitonin has been shown to be useful in differentiating viral infections from bacterial and could prove useful in conjunction with identification of a respiratory virus in this population.4,31,32 In conclusion, this study adds to the growing body of literature regarding the epidemiology of viral pneumonia in adult patients and illustrates the high morbidity and mortality associated with viral pneumonia in adult patients. Additionally, this study suggests that identification of multiple infecting respiratory viruses is a negative prognostic indicator as illustrated by its association with in-hospital mortality. Continued advances in diagnostic technology have enabled more thorough evaluation of respiratory infections. Further investigation into the role viruses play in pneumonia may unclose more answers regarding patient risk factors for and outcomes of viral pneumonia.",
