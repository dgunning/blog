Mass gatherings are divided into different types based on their purpose. The expansion of interconnectivity between societies and increases in the number of national and international events in communities has led to an increase in the number of mass gatherings, which, despite the benefits like cultural exchange, have health challenges such as infectious disease transmission and, should therefore be considered by health planners\n1.",

Various factors, such as the type and location of gathering, the number of participants and the lack of access to health facilities, can affect the incidence of infectious diseases in mass gatherings. Planners must therefore pay attention to these factors in preparation\n1,\n5\u2013\n7. Since a mass gathering is a collection of many people together in one particular site, the possibility of infectious disease transmission due to the high population density always exists. Studies on mass gatherings such as Hajj, Ashura day in Karbala, and Kumbh Mela and Sabarimala in India show the prevalence of infectious diseases in these ceremonies\n8\u2013\n13.",

Mass gatherings are different from structured disasters so that in case of occurrence, many people will be affected\n17. Since the Arbaeen ceremony is held with the presence of many pilgrims from many different countries and, like the Hajj pilgrimage, is based on the lunar calendar, and it is held in Iraq, there is the possibility of the occurrence and transmission of infectious diseases. It is therefore essential to be prepared to control and prevent these diseases. Dealing with infectious diseases in Arbaeen is considered a challenge for policy makers\n10. According to Arbaeen's social and cultural context, it seems essential to take a deeper look in this field. On the other hand, there is relatively little knowledge about the Arbaeen ceremony; therefore, a qualitative method for clarifying the concept and challenges of health system preparedness in Arbaeen ceremony is necessary. The aim of this study was to explore challenges of health system preparedness for communicable diseases in Arbaeen ceremony.",

Moreover, transferability was established by sampling with maximum variation from various centers, including the Ministry of Health and Medical Education and other peer organizations including the Red Cross organization, the Medical Community Mobilization, the Hajj and Pilgrimage Organization, the country's medical universities in the border cities and the Social Security Organization with different experiences of work, education and gender.

Indeed, according to the needs of the targeted group, training must be given to pilgrims, executives and volunteer treatment teams, and the training content for pilgrims should be different to that of executives and policy makers. Past conducted studies of religious gatherings such as the Hajj in Saudi Arabia and Ashura Day in Iraq, as well as other mass gatherings, such as the Tamworth Country Music Festival, Australia, indicate the reality that a crowd of people from diverse nations and cultures is a source of infectious disease; disease transmission is one of the most important challenges of public health in these kinds of events, so using training strategies in relation to hand washing, masking and vaccination is an important factor in preventing the diseases and health improvement\n8,\n14,\n16,\n23\u2013\n33. Since religious ceremonies are rooted in people's beliefs and have great popularity among people, people-centered education therefore has great potential to reduce the gap between knowledge and practice in pilgrims, empowering individuals and enhancing their ability to deal with health threats. This goal is achieved by identifying accurate and targeted needs, developing relevant content and through educational planning\n34. In this study, like other studies on mass gatherings, a personal health training plan, such as the importance of hand washing, using healthy food and masking, should be included in the pilgrims' training plan, and public health training such as vaccination, environmental health, monitoring donations, cooking and distribution, controlling bioterrorism and establishing mobile toilets should be considered in executives and policymakers' preparedness plan.

            "text": "A low understanding of the risks of infectious diseases in pilgrims is one of the other challenges mentioned by the majority of participants, especially policymakers. A lack of risk understanding refers to the inability to identify and respond to dangerous situations. Top documents such as Sendai framework\n35 have identified that understanding risks is the first priority to decrease the incidence of disasters, and that it needs people-based and vast preventive approaches. Besides this, the Hyogo framework and sustainable development goals emphasize the role of training in increasing risk understanding and decreasing the vulnerability of individuals to hazards\n35\u2013\n37. In this study, one of the health issues was fatalism and a low understanding of risk. A study concerning the beliefs and methods of infection control in Hajj pilgrims residing in Australia also showed that the majority of participants had low understanding of the occurrence of respiratory infections and the need for an influenza vaccine in Hajj, and refused the vaccine, using trust in Allah as an excuse and belief in destiny when dealing with the risk of disease\n38. Another problem is also the prevalence of self-treatment among pilgrims. In a study aimed at assessing the knowledge, attitude and the performance of Australian pilgrims on using antibiotics in Hajj showed that they did not have proper understanding of using these drugs and used medications arbitrarily, meaning that more training on proper use is needed\n39. A lack of understanding of health instructions and disregard for public and personal health in any situation can endanger human health. It seems that the fatalism of pilgrims with regards to diseases increases their vulnerability if the understanding of danger is reduced. Islamic instructions state that the person is obliged to preserve his health and life in any location and position, even in holy lands, and to avoid risks\n40. Given that Arbaeen is a religious gathering, religious leaders have an important position in ceremony implementation and can affect the pilgrims' beliefs and understanding of risks during pilgrimage. The influence of religious leaders on the people's beliefs can provide the opportunity to promote health. We should consider that religious scholars must be trained first and then transfer health instructions and methods of infectious disease control to the people in cultural and religious gatherings such as mosques.",

            "text": "Another problem in this field is the poor control of the effective factors on infectious diseases. One of the most common causes of infectious disease is the epidemiology triangle, which has three components\u2014pathogen, host and environment. The interaction of these agents causes infectious diseases, and considering these factors can help control infectious diseases\n41. Considering the three factors in Arbaeen is very important. The \u2018host\u2019 factor includes different pilgrims with diverse cultures and nationalities. The \u2018environment\u2019 factor includes holding the ceremony in Iraq, which, due to the many years of internal and external conflicts, has had little attention paid to its health infrastructure, and also the overall environmental factors effective in the occurrence of infectious diseases. Different studies\n1,\n8,\n42 have shown that factors such as crowd size, equipment, climate, the event duration and location, the type of ceremony, and features and behavior of participants affect the occurrence of diseases in mass gatherings, and planners must consider it during preparations. To prevent the occurrence of contagious diseases and their consequences, comprehensive planning, rapid diagnosis and effective management is required\n1,\n8,\n42. One of the factors that affects the occurrence of disease is the time of year that the Arbaeen ceremony is held. Arbaeen ceremony is held based on the lunar calendar and so its needs and challenges differ and are dependent on the season that the ceremony is held, so that if the ceremony is held in cold seasons, respiratory diseases are more common and if is held in hot seasons, the majority of infectious diseases are of the digestive system. Additionally, population movement among different countries leads to the transfer of local diseases, so health considerations and cooperation between states are needed.. Policymakers should consider three components\u2014pathogen, host and environment\u2014before the beginning of Arbaeen mass gathering. It is also necessary that the health system is aware of all possible scenarios and the methods for dealing with them. The preparedness plan at the local level includes assessing the risk, resources capacity, equipment, surveillance system and an expert team for providing services to pilgrims.",

The term \u2018health infrastructures\u2019 refers to health facilities and their related factors. The infrastructure includes staff instructions, processes and the development of systematic approaches related to personnel resources and medical support plans\n43. Various studies indicate that readiness for structured mass gatherings depends on investing in health infrastructures and the size of gatherings, and strengthening infrastructures and post-event coordination of mass gatherings must be continued. The inappropriate location of gatherings, the weakness of facilities and the lack of infrastructure increase the vulnerability of communities\n44,\n45. The remoteness of health facilities and a lack of needed road infrastructure can make medical services and emergency assistance ineffective. Limitation of infrastructure and medical care system, increase the incidence of injuries\n44,\n45. Arbaeen is held in a country that has long been involved with interior and exterior wars; therefore, it seems that due to economic difficulties, it does not have the capacity to support the necessary health infrastructure required by pilgrims. Although according to the participants, the health system in Iraq seems somewhat weak, given that Arbaeen ceremony is of particular popularity among Shia Muslims and is held annually, therefore, some of the activities serving pilgrims and its management during the Arbaeen ceremony is voluntarily conducted. In recent years, numerous health facilities have been constructed on religious places, as well as along the path of pilgrimage using pilgrims' donations. Management of pilgrims\u2019 donations can help to build and maintain health infrastructure in Iraq. With this policy, the Iranian pilgrims will benefit from the Arbaeen ceremony, and the level of health in the region will be improved.",
