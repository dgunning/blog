ACE2 is a homolog of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which plays an important role in the renin\u2013angiotensin system for blood pressure homeostasis. Recent studies of Li et al. [18] have shown a protective effect of ACE2 against experimental lung fibrosis through its ability to degrade local tissue angiotensin II (ANG II) in response to bleomycin. Furthermore, in the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis, they have proposed the involvement of the down regulation of ACE2 as an integral component of the sequence of events leading to lung collagen deposition. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the loss of ACE2 in lung fibrosis are currently under investigation. A typical clinical feature associated with SARS is also pulmonary fibrosis and associated lung failure whose underlying mechanism still remains elusive [19]. Investigations leading to the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for the loss of ACE2 in pulmonary fibrosis might provide a clue to the reason behind fibrosis associated lung injury in SARS.",

In this work, we have proposed the role of miRNA in modulating the expression of ACE2 along with the stage specific cellular differentiation at the site of infection initiation.

This study develops a complex interaction map between disease-related factors, miRNAs and BASCs in SARS disease pathway, which will provide some clues for diagnostic markers to view an overall interplay leading to disease progression.

Further, SARS+ cells are distinct from cells expressing the macrophage/monocyte specific marker CD68. But SARS+ cells are found to express the functional receptor ACE2 as well as the stem/progenitor cell marker CD34 and Oct-4 [23]. Chen et al have also shown that SARS+ cells are CD45\u2212. Hence it has been confirmed that the SARS+ cells in the infected lung were a subset of putative stem/progenitor cells expressing CD34, Oct-4 and ACE2. Further, it is unlikely for SARS+ cells to produce differentiated cell markers. The presence of SARS+ cells within the multiple cell types at the bronchiolar lining layers makes it difficult to isolate SARS+ cells. Some of the SARS+ cells remains overlapped with adjacent cytokeratin+ cells which might be mistakenly interpreted as colocalized cells. In such a situation BASC (Sca-1+ CD34+ CD45\u2212 Pecam\u2212) in terminal bronchioles located exclusively at the broncho-alveolar duct junction (BADJ) stands a good selection to be investigated as the prime target cells of SARS-CoV infection.",

These might be a subset of Sca-1+ CD4\u2212 Pecam\u2212 CD34\u2212 population (Figure 1). Later studies have shown that cytokeratin+ cells do not express the functional receptor ACE2 [23]. Further, SARS+ cells do not express cytokeratin and are CD34+ SSEA-1\u2212. Phagocytosis is a common mode of virus entry within surrounding cells in SARS infection [24]. Hence, presence of SARS antigen within the subset of Oct-4+ colony cells which are Sca-1+ CD34\u2212 SSEA-1+ cytokeratin+ is most likely due to phagocytosis.

On the contrary, the RNA virus co-opt host-miRNAs to suppress their own replication to evade immune elimination and establish a strong infection. It has been found that human infecting single-stranded RNA viruses are enriched for target sequences of human miRNAs [42]. Or else rapidly evolving RNA viruses might evolve targets that match host miRNAs in order to increase their host specificity. It is very likely that the rapidly evolving virus take advantage of slowly evolving host miRNAs to increase their survival in the host, analogous to the manner in which viruses take advantage of other cellular processes. Co-option of host miRNAs by SARS-CoV to suppress their own replication will allow it to be in a latent state and escape the host immune system at the initial time point of transmission and infection. Once successful transmission within the host system takes place, antiviral miRNA target sequences in the virus can be expected to mutate rapidly to maximize mismatches and thus minimize the impact of \u2018antiviral\u2019 miRNAs. Rapid mutation in SARS-CoV is supported by the fact that SARS-CoV lack proof reading activity in their polymerases. RNA-dependent polymerase in SARS-CoV misincorporates 8.26 bases per million [43].",

This implies that a single mutation within the complementary regions of this conserved 3-mer motif within the viral targets will disrupt the miRNA seed-target match and will enable the virus to escape the antiviral effect of host-miRNAs after successful transmission within the host.

But the controlled expression of target CCR1 in an uninfected cell inspite of the significantly low expression of its corresponding miR-223 in BASCs suggest that there must be a cascaded fine tuned interaction masterminded by the virus which is going on within the infected cell. It is known that N protein activates NF-KB in Vero E6 cells [38]. CCR1 is one of the target genes of NF-KB which is activated at a later stage [56]. Hence, we propose that within BASCs, reduced expression of miR-223 helps N protein to enter the host cell. On successful entry, N protein might be using miR-223 once again to activate CCR1 via NF-KB at its replicative stage to enhance lung fibrosis and at the same time gets empowered to manipulate the entire gene expression of the host cell by controlling the expression of Oct-4. The exact mechanism of such miRNA-mediated events needs further investigation.

SARS-CoV enters the host; infects the BASCs of the lungs and controls its developmental stages via the molecular switches-miRNAs. Co-option of host miRNAs by viruses reveal their intelligent plan to control their replication in order to evade immune elimination until they undergoes successful transmission and establish a strong infection. Thereafter, they undergo rapid mutation to maximize the target-miRNA mismatches and enhance their replication before the cell reaches at a fully differentiated state. On successful replication, the virus infects resident, infiltrating, and circulating immune cells. The circulating immune cells carry the virus to other organs and causes damages to the immune cells of spleen, peripheral and central lymph nodes and other lymphoid tissues. The immune defense being weakened significantly, leads to rapid deterioration of the pneumonia. It is worth to test these cells for the expression of Oct-4 and ACE2 for further confirmatory conclusion.",

The potential therapeutic effect of modulating host-miRNA levels is also worth considering. This emerging picture of miRNA regulation in SARS-CoV infected individual will make the host-virus interaction far richer and more complex than the crisp linear pathways of the previous decade, with miRNAs participating in executive decisions at the interesting and vulnerable nodes in regulatory networks. By boosting the level of the host virus-specific miRNAs, it might be possible to turn what was a desirable outcome for the virus into a desirable outcome for the patient. Under the current hypothesis, we would predict that decreasing the level of host virus-specific miRNAs would result in promotion of viral replication, leading to immunological recognition and clearance of the virus by the host immune system. Further, increasing the level of miRNAs exclusive for the N and S protein might also block viral entry. However, manipulating the level of host miRNAs could have unintended consequences because the physiological functions of the miRNAs might be altered or viral pathology might be enhanced. Further silencing of miRNAs with antagomirs specifically within the infected cell could become another therapeutic strategy where miRNAs participate in disease aetiology. Nevertheless, these potential interventions merit further evaluation.",

Background is determined using a regression-based background mapping method [68]. The miRNA dataset was filtered according to the standard procedure to exclude spots with minimum intensity and size. Further for the dual-sample experiments, the ratio of the two sets of detected signals (log2 transformed, balanced) are calculated. Thereafter, t-values are calculated for each miRNA between the test and the control groups, and P-values are computed from the theoretical t-distribution. miRNAs with P-values below a critical P-value (typically 0.01) are the differentially detected signals and were selected as our global miRNA expression profile data set (of mouse BASCs) in BASCGAP.
