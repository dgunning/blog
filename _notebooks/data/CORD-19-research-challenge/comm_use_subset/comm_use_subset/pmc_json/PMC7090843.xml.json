Moreover, person-to-person transmission has been recorded outside mainland China.3 On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization held an emergency meeting and declared the global COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.4",

The ever-increasing number of confirmed and suspected cases, overwhelming workload, depletion of personal protection equipment, widespread media coverage, lack of specific drugs, and feelings of being inadequately supported may all contribute to the mental burden of these health care workers. Previous studies have reported adverse psychological reactions to the 2003 SARS outbreak among health care workers.5,6,7,8 Studies showed that those health care workers feared contagion and infection of their family, friends, and colleagues,5 felt uncertainty and stigmatization,5,6 reported reluctance to work or contemplating resignation,6 and reported experiencing high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms,7 which could have long-term psychological implications.7 Similar concerns about the mental health, psychological adjustment, and recovery of health care workers treating and caring for patients with COVID-19 are now arising.",

To compare the interregional differences of mental health outcomes among health care workers in China, samples were stratified by their geographic location (ie, Wuhan, other regions inside Hubei province, and regions outside Hubei province). Because Wuhan was most severely affected, more hospitals in Wuhan were sampled. Hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for COVID-19 were eligible to participate in this survey. A total of 20 hospitals in Wuhan (10 designated by the local government to treat COVID-19 and 10 nondesignated), 7 hospitals in other regions of Hubei province, and 7 hospitals from 7 other provinces with a high incidence of COVID-19 (1 hospital from each province) were included.

Because of the increasingly arduous situation, the mental health symptoms of health care workers could become more severe. Thus, long-term psychological implications of this population are worth further investigation. Third, this study was unable to distinguish the association of symptoms with being a clinician in this region vs simply living in this region (because there was no comparator group) and was also unable to distinguish preexisting mental health symptoms vs new symptoms.
