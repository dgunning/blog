In hosts exposed to viruses such as influenza and coronaviruses (the causative agents of severe acute respiratory syndrome), the viral load continuously declines during the contraction phase [1,2]. In contrast, in chronic viral infections, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, contraction slows down such that the viral load approaches a steady state, called the virological set point [3,4]. In both infection types, the expansion and contraction of the viral load have been modeled as single exponential functions, with parameters determined by linear regression of the log transformed data [3,5-7]. This simple approach is reasonable as long as the conditions, e.g., the availability of target cells or the immune response, hardly change within each phase. Using this approach, the initial growth rate, death rate of the infected cells, and the basic reproduction number (i.e., R0) have been estimated, which has improved our understanding of particular virus infections, and has guided medical treatment [7-9]. For example, once the basic reproduction number is estimated, the critical inhibition, 1\u20131/R0, induced by vaccines, or by antiviral drugs, to prevent primary virus infection can be calculated [6].",

In chronic viral infections such as HIV and HCV, the death rate is estimated from large perturbations of the set point viral load data instigated by potent anti-viral therapy [4,10-13]. Shortly after effective treatment, the decay rate of viral load approaches the death rate of productively infected cells. However, estimating the death rate of infected cells during the acute phase remains a challenging task, and, as a consequence, it is difficult to accurately estimate the basic reproduction number from viral load data during the early stages of viral infection. In addition to calculation of the basic reproduction number, the death rate per se is useful for evaluating the efficacy of vaccine-induced cellular immune responses during the acute phase of virus infection [14-16]. Therefore, an improved method for estimating the death rate of infected cells during this phase is urgently required.",

The time evolution of target cell densities and viral load were modeled during the acute phase. The datasets describing acute infection were subsequently analyzed by two novel mathematical models to evaluate whether the new models could accurately estimate the known parameters. Our proposed models properly described the artificial datasets and delivered better estimates of the parameters and well calculated indices than conventional models (i.e., simple exponential models). Our methods proved especially effective for calculating the death rate of infected cells. We then applied our models to time course data from a human hepatopoietic stem cell-transplanted humanized mouse model infected with HIV type-1 (HIV-1) [17-20], to quantify the infection dynamics during the acute phase. To our knowledge, this is the first report quantifying the dynamics of acute HIV-1 infection in humanized mice. Finally, we discuss how our approach may be combined with animal experiments. Like previous simple exponential models [3,5-7], our approach is quite general and can be used in several infection models.",

Since target cell densities in the peripheral blood (PB) may also depend on other factors, like inflammation, activation and redistribution, we next write a model where the target cell dynamics are decoupled from the viral dynamics. Since, during the acute phase of several virus infections, such as HIV, SIV and SHIV, the decrease in number of target cells in PB is preceded by an initial flat phase [14-20,26-28], we propose a phenomenological model for the target cells consisting of an initial flat phase, and a second phase of exponential loss (Figure 1). This basically implies that we assume that target cells only become a limiting factor when their density starts to decline. Thus, the dynamics of target cells is described as follows:",

Previously acute infection data have been quantified using piece wise linear regression of the log transformed viral loads before and after the peak in the viral load [3,5-7]. The ascending and descending slopes of the log viral load roughly correspond to the exponential growth rate, g0, and the death rate, \u03b4, of infected cells, respectively [3,5-7]. Since g0 = rT(0) - \u03b4 and R0 = rT(0)/\u03b4, these two slopes suffice to estimate the basic reproduction number, R0 \u2248 1 + g0/\u03b4, and knowing the initial target cell density, T(0), the viral replication rate per target cell can be estimated from the R0, i.e., r = \u03b4R0/T(0) [3,5-7]. Here we call this classical model as the \u201cpiece wise regression\u201d model (PWR). It has been realized before that the down-slope will only reflect the death rate of infected cells, \u03b4, if there is hardly any residual infection of target cells during the contraction phase, i.e., if target cells are markedly depleted [3,5-7].",

Five humanized mice were infected with the CCR5-tropic HIV-1 (strain AD8) [29], and 100 \u03bcl of peripheral blood (PB) was routinely collected under anesthesia through the retro-orbital venous plexus at 0, 3, 7, 14, and 21 days post-infection, as previously described [17-20]. The amount of viral RNA in 50 \u03bcl of plasma was quantified by RT-PCR (Bio Medical Laboratories, Inc). To estimate target cell densities, the number of memory CD4+ T cells was measured by hematometry and flow cytometry, as previously described [17-20]. Briefly, the number of human leukocytes in 10 \u03bcl of peripheral blood (PB) was measured in a Celltac \u03b1 MEK-6450 hematology analyzer (Nihon Kohden, Co.), and the percentage of memory CD4+ T cells in human CD45+ leukocytes (i.e., CD45+ CD3+ CD4+ CD45RA- cells) was quantified in a FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer. In the flow cytometry analyses, APC-conjugated anti-CD4 antibody (RPA-4; Biolegend), APC-Cy7-conjugated anti-CD3 antibody (HIT3a; Biolegend), and PE-conjugated anti-CD45 antibody (HI30; Biolegend) were used.",

This seemed natural as we are also fitting the log transformed data, and on a log scale this corresponds to the measurement error of about 60%. The generated datasets were fitted to the numerical solutions of the RQS model (Eqs. (1) and (4)), the analytical solution of the PWT model (Eqs. (5\u20138)), and to the previous PWR model. The sum of squared residuals was minimized using the FindMinimum package of Mathematica 9.0, fitting the target cell and viral load data simultaneously. The typical behavior of the models using these best-fit parameter estimates is depicted in Figure 2, together with the simulated data. Other standard deviations of the parameters yielded similar results (results not shown). The two novel models reasonably describe the acute phase of viral infection. Note that target cell densities are partially depleted in the RQS model, and will ultimately approach \u201c0\u201d in the PWT model.",

The standard deviations were set as \u03c3\u03b2=10-9,\u03c3\u03b4=0.3,\u03c3p=400. In this way, we obtained a distribution of the basic reproduction number centered around the true value (R0 = 2.48). We then randomly sampled one parameter set of \u03b2, \u03b4, p from the distributions, and produced 200 different artificial datasets as explained above. Analyzing each dataset with the same three models (RQS, PWT and PWR), we calculated 95% confidence intervals (CI) for g0, r, \u03b4 and R0, and investigated whether the 95% CI successfully contained the true values of g0, r, \u03b4 and R0 used to create the data set. This procedure was repeated for all 200 datasets, and Table 1 provides the frequency of datasets for which the 95% CI successfully contained the true values of g0, r, \u03b4 and R0, i.e., the coverage probability. Although the initial growth rate was well estimated by the previous PWR model, the novel RQS and PWT models estimated the viral replication rate, death rate of infected cells, and basic reproduction number much more accurately than the PWR model. Thus, the novel models can more accurately extract information from acute-phase viral infection data.",

In both models this loss of target cells continues during the contraction phase.

Using the same equation, Petravic et al.[16] show that this final size of the target cell level provides a good description of the nadir, T\nmin\n, of the target cell density during an acute infection. Defining f = T\nmin\n/T(0) as the fraction of surviving target cells, we use the final size equation to compute different values of the infection rate \u03b2 to vary the nadir of the target cells over the interval f \u2208 [0.001, 0.200].

The parameters are accurately estimated by all methods when target cells are severely depleted (i.e., when f approaches 0), reconfirming that the previous PWR model can accurately quantify the infected cell death when the target cells are severely depleted. This, for example, occurs in CXCR4-tropic simian\u2013human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infections (which deplete na\u00efve and memory CD4 T cells during the acute phase) [14,16,26-28].

These estimates are not in disagreement with the replication rate of HIV-1 in human patients, which has been estimated to be 1.01 \u00b1 0.37 per day [6]. We estimate a death rate of HIV-1 infected cells in humanized mice as \u03b4 ranging from 0.30 to 0.76 and from 0.38 to 0.76 per day with the RQS model and the PWT model, respectively (see Tables 2 and 3). Again, this result is in concordance with estimates of viral death rate in treated HIV-1 infected patients [10,11]. We then determined the basic reproduction number R0 of HIV-1 in humanized mice from the individual estimates of T(0), r and \u03b4, obtaining R0 ranging from 1.58 to 3.88 and from 1.77 to 3.26 in the RQS and PWT models, respectively (see Tables 2 and 3). Since the mean of R0 corresponds to a predicted target cell nadir of f = 0.12 in the RQS model, the simple exponential model is not expected to perform equally well on this data (see Figure 3).",

The novel models use the observed target cell densities when estimating the parameter values, and by using simulated data we have demonstrated that the new models typically outperform the previous model. Applying the new models to data obtained in humanized mice estimates that the rates at which the virus expands, and at which infected cells die, resemble those measured in humans.",

Indeed, in animal experiments using rhesus macaques [14-16,26-28], ferrets [30], and mice [17-20,31-34], both target cell densities and viral loads have been measured during the acute phase of viral infection. For example, the number of uninfected (and infected) cells in the lungs or respiratory tracts of macaques, ferrets and mice that were experimentally infected with influenza could be measured [30,31,34]. Using the CXCR4-tropic SHIV/macaque model, both target cell densities (na\u00efve and memory CD4 T cells) and viral loads from PB have been measured [14,16,26-28]. The target cells of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), or CCR5-tropic SHIV infection (memory CD4 T cells expressing CCR5), have been measured from gastrointestinal mucosa samples [15].

The blue and red symbols denote one representative simulated dataset, the dotted line the best fit of the RQS model, the dashed line that of the PWT model, and the black solid lines show the ascending and descending slopes obtained with the PWR model.
