Adding equimolar amounts of Mag and Hon showed no obvious disaggregation effect, while the presence of 3-fold amount of either compound prevented further aggregation of hCT (Fig. 6A,B). When the molar ratio of Mag and Hon was further increased to 5:1, the hCT aggregates were disassembled with ThT fluorescence intensity remarkably reduced to 53% and 55% of untreated control after 48 h of incubation, respectively (Fig. 7). The morphology of hCT aggregates after disaggregation was then observed under TEM. Addition of Mag and Hon disaggregated preformed hCT fibrils into small amorphous aggregates (Fig. 6E,F), which agrees with ThT fluorescence assay results. We then quantitated the soluble hCT concentrations in the supernatant after disaggregation by using bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. After 48 h of pre-incubation, the concentration of soluble hCT in the supernatant was lower than 20 \u03bcg/mL (Fig. 6G), whereas the equimolar amount of EGCG increased hCT concentration to ca. 50 \u03bcg/mL (P < 0.05; Fig. 6H,I). Equimolar amounts of Mag and Hon showed no obvious disaggregation effect, whereas at higher concentrations (3:1 and 5:1) significantly increased concentration of soluble hCT in the supernatant (more than 100 \u03bcg/mL) were observed after 48 h of incubation with two compounds (Fig. 6H,I).",

ITC results also indicated Mag bound to hCT with a higher binding constant compared to Hon (Figure S3). This may due to the slight structural difference between two compounds. With two adjacent hydroxyls, Mag is more likely to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds, which causes a smaller angle between two benzene rings compared to Hon6869. When binding to hCT molecules, a larger angle between two benzene rings may produce greater steric hindrance, which may explain the relatively lower potency of Hon compared to Mag on inhibiting hCT aggregation. It is also noted that Mag and Hon may inhibit hCT aggregation through different mechanisms. ThT fluorescence assay suggested that Mag increased lag time, and inhibited aggregation from oligomerization stage, whereas Hon showed little effects on increasing lag time although it decreased the fibril elongation rate (Fig. 2A,B). ITC assay also suggested Mag and Hon bound to hCT at a 1:1 and 3:1 stoichiometry, respectively (Figure S3), possibly indicating different binding sites on hCT between two compounds. Notably, in the dot blot assay, honokiol showed a stronger inhibitory effect compared with magnolol, especially at an equimolar ratio; this may also due to different interactions between two compounds, which leads to the different conformations formed during aggregation, and interferes the dot blot results. However, the molecular mechanism of inhibitory effects of Mag and Hon on hCT amyloid formation remained to be clarified, and it will be of great interest to detect monomer and polymers formed during aggregation with specific monoclonal antibody by using western blot approach as Tufail, S. et al. described70. It will also be useful to probe the exact membrane protection mechanisms of Hon and Mag by using biophysical techniques, particularly, with the use of high-resolution solids-state NMR approaches5055717273.",
