In this sense, the interaction between intracellular parasites and their hosts represents a paradigm of resource manipulation. In general, a virulent relationship results in the alteration of many aspects of cellular metabolism and development, which are taken over in the parasite's own benefit [5]\u2013[7]. Whether the relationship between a host and a parasite evolves towards a more or less virulent or benign situation depends on several genetic and ecological factors that may affect virus accumulation and transmission between hosts [5]. Of particular interest in the context of emerging infectious diseases is the characterization of changes in the pathogen's genome that are responsible for adaptation to a new host after spilling over from the original one and to understand how these changes may alter host's metabolic and regulatory interactions.",

In recent years, microarrays have been widely used to analyze the alteration of gene expression in host cells after infection with both animal [e.g.], [ 8]\u2013[13] and plant [e.g.], [ 14]\u2013[18] viruses. However, a common drawback of these previous studies is that experiments were either done in cell cultures [8]\u2013[13], which always represent an artificial and oversimplified environment, or using host-virus pairs whose previous evolutionary history of association is unknown and the degree of impact of abiotic environmental factor uncontrolled [14], [17]. Therefore, the relevance of these studies and, more importantly, their evolutionary implications for the problem of emergent infectious diseases, are rather limited. In the following, the results from an experiment simulating the emergence of a plant virus that crossed the species barrier and is horizontally spreading on a population of partially-susceptible hosts are reported. Evolutionary changes in viral genome and phenotypic properties and, more importantly, in the way it interacts with its host's transcriptome are the focus of the study.",

            "text": "The pathosystem Tobacco etch potyvirus (TEV)-Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Ler has been chosen for the present study. TEV genome is composed of a 9.5 kb positive polarity single-strand RNA that encodes a large ORF whose translation generates a polyprotein that is subsequently self-processed by virus-encoded proteases into 10 mature peptides [19], [20]. TEV has a moderately wide host range infecting around 149 species from 19 families [21], although most of its natural hosts belong to the family Solanaceae. In these plants TEV induces stunting and mottling, necrotic etching and malformation in leafs [21]. A. thaliana ecotypes vary in their susceptibility to TEV. Some ecotypes (e.g., C24 and Ler) are fully susceptible [22], [23] whereas many other (e.g., Col-0 and Ws-2) do not allow for systemic movement but support replication and cell-to-cell spread in inoculated leafs [22], [23]. Arabidopsis is a member of the family Brassicaceae, which belongs to a different order than the Solanaceae within the class Magnoliopsida\n[24]. Therefore, adaptation of TEV to A. thaliana represents a jump in host species at the taxonomic level of orders.",

Each lineage consisted on 10 plants. Twenty-one dpi, positive infections were confirmed by Western blot hybridization using an anti-coat protein antibody (data not shown). One of the infected plants from each lineage was randomly chosen to be the source of viral particles for infecting the next batch of plants. This basic transfer protocol was serially repeated every three weeks. In six out of seven cases, lineages went to extinction as a consequence of decreases in viral loads beyond the threshold value that ensures efficient transmission. The only surviving lineage was maintained for 17 serial passages (hereafter TEV-At17). The viral load reached by TEV-At17 21 dpi, was 2138.38\u00b1134.08 LFU/mg.

Full-genome sequencing of TEV-At17 indicates that six changes have occurred during adaptation (first six rows in Table 1); three of them were non-synonymous. The first non-synonymous change, A1047V, affected the P3 protein. P3 localizes in nucleus and nucleoli in association with the NIa protein and participates in virus amplification through its interaction with the CI protein [20]. In other potyviruses, P3 is also involved in systemic movement [25], [26]. The second mutation is a T1210M replacement in the 6K1 peptide. This short peptide has been implicated in plant pathogenicity since its deletion results in symptomless infections [20]. Finally, the third amino acid replacement observed is L2013F in the VPg domain of the NIa protein. VPg is covalently attached to the 5\u2032 end of the viral RNA and has essential functions in the viral replication and, relevant for the problem in hand, it has been reported as a key determinant in host-genotype specificity for systemic movement or replication [20] and it has been recently demonstrated that the proper interaction between the translation initiation factor eI4B and VPg is necessary for TEV infection [27]. In conclusion, these three mutations may explain the observed improvement in virus amplification and pathogenicity. The relevance of the three synonymous substitutions observed is not as clear, although their adaptive value cannot be ruled out.",

In addition, all three possible pairs of non-synonymous mutations and the triple non-synonymous mutant were also created. A. thaliana Ler plants were inoculated with these nine mutant clones and maintained in the same growth conditions for three weeks. The results of this experiment are summarized in Table 1. All mutant genotypes were viable and replicated and accumulated in the plants, as confirmed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Among the three single mutants, the only clone that produced visible symptoms was the one containing the L2013F allele in VPg. These symptoms were, nonetheless, qualitatively milder than those produced by TEV-At17 (Figure S1). Concerning the three double mutants, only the combination of VPg and P3 substitutions induced symptoms that were qualitatively more severe than those produced by the single VPg L2013F mutant (Table 1) and almost as severe as those observed for TEV-At17. By contrast, mutation 6K1 T1210M does not have any effect on aggravating the symptoms associated with VPg L2013F. The combination of substitutions in P3 and 6K1 did not produce any symptom. Finally, the triple mutant recreated the strong symptoms characteristic of TEV-At17 (Table 1 and Figure S1). All together, these results suggest that the presence of substitution L2013F in the VPg protein is enough for triggering symptoms and that the severity of these symptoms is enhanced by the presence of substitution A1047V in P3, suggesting an epistatic interaction between these two mutations. The role of substitution T1210M in the 6K1 peptide remains unclear.",

Our goal is not to identify single genes but rather global transcriptomic changes. Long-oligonucleotide microarrays representing almost all genes in A. thaliana genome have been used to this end. Five replicates were analyzed per experimental treatment (control mock-inoculated plants, and plants infected with TEV and TEV-At17) using a global reference experimental design. After quality analysis, a total of 13,722 spots, corresponding to 12,180 genes, were considered as valid for further analyses (Table S1). Data were normalized to the median expression of non-infected plants, and thus they reflect biological differences in gene expression in each sample analyzed. Statistical analysis allowed identification of genes whose expression responded differentially upon infection with either TEV or TEV-At17 (Figure 2). When comparing global patterns of gene expression in plants infected with ancestral and adapted viruses, 496 genes showed higher expression and 1,322 genes lower expression in TEV-At17 infections than in TEV infections (Figure 2 and Tables S2 and S3); which represents 2.7 times more down-regulated than up-regulated genes (Binomial test, P<0.0001).",

Only a significant differential category, response to salt stress, was identified for the SOM A3 of up-regulated genes shown in Figure 3A. By contrast, a large number of GO terms show significant over- and under-representation in the differentially down-regulated genes (Figure 3B). Table 2 shows the non-redundant functional categories that correspond to SOMs B1 plus B2 (i.e., genes over-expressed after infection by TEV but not differing from uninfected plants when infected with TEV-At17). Interestingly, significantly over-represented genes belong to functional categories which are related to plant responses to different abiotic (wounding, light intensity, temperature, salinity) and biotic stresses. Furthermore, genes involved in the SAR and in the activation of innate immune responses [29] were not expressed on plants infected with TEV-At17 while they were over-expressed on plants infected with the ancestral TEV, suggesting that the evolved virus acquired the ability to evade certain plant defense mechanisms, perhaps explaining the observed increase of viral load. Genes involved in basic cellular processes such as nucleic acid metabolism, translation and proteolysis were under-represented among down-regulated genes in SOMs B1 plus B2 (Table 2), suggesting that the plant may be compensating for the consumption of these resources by an increased viral replication.",

The increase in viral fitness correlates with deep changes in the patterns of host's gene expression, illustrating that the subtle but dynamic interplay between the pathogen and the plant shifts as the virus adapts to its host. Under the experimental conditions imposed, it may be speculated that natural selection may had favored viral genomes that avoided plant defense mechanisms as suggested by the observation of stress-related genes not being activated after infection with the evolved virus (Table 2). Therefore, perhaps as a consequence, increases in the strength of symptoms, virus accumulation and transmissibility have been observed. These phenotypic changes are associated to a few genomic changes fixed in the viral genome. In particular, the development of symptoms is associated to a single substitution in the viral VPg protein, whereas ulterior mutations in other viral components simply magnify symptoms. Our starting hypothesis was that viral adaptation occurs throughout the integration of viral replication processes within host physiology and circuitry of genetic and metabolic interactions. Necessarily, this integration has to affect the patterns of host's gene expression. Our experiments directly test this hypothesis, supporting its validity and, furthermore, pinpointing some physiological processes that may be targeted by the virus as it improves its fitness. The obvious follow-up of this study is to dissect the physiological processes and identify, whenever possible, the precise steps and proteins that are getting targeted by the virus during its adaptation.",

Long 70-mers oligonucleotide microarrays, provided by Dr. D. Galbraith (Univ. Arizona), contain 29,110 probes from the Qiagen-Operon Arabidopsis Genome Array Ready Oligo Set (AROS) Version 3.0. This oligo set represents 26,173 protein-coding genes, 28,964 protein-coding gene transcripts and 87 miRNAs and is based on the ATH1 release 5.0 of the TIGR Arabidopsis genome annotation database (www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/ath1/) and release 4.0 of the miRNA Registry at the Sanger Institute (www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Rfam/mirna/index.shtml). Further information can be found at the Operon website (omad.operon.com/download/index.php). Oligos were rehydrated and immobilized by UV irradiation. Slides were then washed twice in 0.1% SDS, 4 times in water, dipped in 96% ethanol for 1 min, and dried by centrifugation.

Slides were then rinsed five times in H2O and dried by centrifugation. Slides were hybridized immediately. Labeled RNA was used to hybridize the slides basically as described in [40]. After hybridization and wash, slides were scanned at 532 nm for the Cy3 and 635 nm for the Cy5 dyes, with a GenePix 4000B scanner (Axon Molecular Devices), at 10 nm resolution and 100% laser power. Photomultiplier tube voltages were adjusted to equal the overall signal intensity for each channel, to increase signal-to-noise ratio, and to reduce number of spots with saturated pixels. Spot intensities were quantified using GenePix Pro 6.0 (Axon Molecular Devices).",

Median, mean and standard deviations were calculated from each treatment (control, TEV- and TEV-At17-infected plants), and all data were normalized to the median of the expression in control samples. To detect differentially expressed genes in plants infected with TEV-At17 compared to TEV, data were analyzed with the SAM package [42], using two-class comparison (TEV versus TEV-At17) with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5.38% with no fold-change cut-off. Differentially over- and under-expressed genes were grouped in 2\u00d72 self-organizing maps (SOMs) [43] using Acuity with Euclidean squared similarity metrics. Gene lists were further analyzed with FatiGO [33] to find differential distributions of gene ontology (GO) terms between statistically differential genes in each SOM and the rest of genes in the microarray, with P values adjusted after correcting for multiple testing [33]. SAM analysis at 1% FDR gave qualitatively identical results, confirming their robustness to changes in arbitrarily-chosen statistical thresholds.",
