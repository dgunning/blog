Seasonal influenza viruses cause annual epidemics during autumn and winter in temperate regions. They predominantly cause upper respiratory tract disease with rare extension to the lower respiratory tract, resulting in severe and even fatal pneumonia [1]. Pandemic influenza viruses, like the pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus in 2009, cause sporadic pandemics with variable mortality. In fatal cases of pH1N1 infection, virus antigen expression occurred throughout the respiratory tract and was associated with both upper and lower respiratory tract disease [2]. Zoonotic influenza viruses, such as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus, are sporadically transmitted from poultry and other animals to humans, but do not transmit efficiently from human to human [3]. Human infection with HPAI H5N1 virus involves primarily the lower respiratory tract, resulting in diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and a fatality rate of almost 60% in confirmed cases [4].",

In part, this is because the distribution of receptors for human and avian influenza viruses in the respiratory tract of ferrets is similar to that in humans [6]. Therefore, the ferret is often used in animal models to study the pathogenesis of different influenza virus strains and to evaluate the efficacy of vaccines and antiviral agents against influenza [7], [8], [9], [10]. In these studies, it is critical to collect respiratory tract samples for virological, pathological, and molecular analyses at both the appropriate time point after infection and the appropriate location along the respiratory tract. This is because influenza virus infection is a highly dynamic process, both temporally and spatially.",

Our results showed that, at 4 days post inoculation (dpi), pH1N1 caused pneumonia intermediate in severity between that caused by seasonal H1N1 and HPAI H5N1. This was associated with virus replication throughout the lower respiratory tract for pH1N1, while seasonal H1N1 replicated mainly in the bronchi, and HPAI H5N1 replicated mainly in the alveoli. However, the location of virus replication and extent and severity of associated pathological changes were recorded at a single time point. Other experiments have used multiple time points (usually 1, 3, 5, and 14 dpi) to study the dynamics of influenza virus infection in the ferret respiratory tract [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]; however, these experiments often lacked detailed pathological or virological analyses of samples collected along the full length of the respiratory tract on all time points.",

Excretion of H3N2 was a positive linear function of viral production in the upper regions (Table 6).

Two animals showed nervous signs, characterized by ataxia, drifting to the right, walking into a corner and aggression. Virus was excreted in nasal and pharyngeal swabs, with lower virus titers than the pH1N1 and H3N2 groups during the first 3 days for the nose and the first 2 days for the pharynx (Figures 1a and b). In contrast to what was seen in the other virus groups, the nasal swabs showed lower titers than the pharyngeal swabs. This indicated lower replication in the nose, as was also suggested by the low levels of virus antigen expression and low virus titers in the nose (Figure 3). The increase in body temperature showed a peak on 1 dpi. At later time points, the average temperature decreased below baseline values due to the progressively moribund state of most of the ferrets (Figure 1c).

The associated lesions followed the same spatial distribution as virus infection, but their severity peaked between 1 and 6 days later (Table 2): at 4 to 7 dpi for H3N2 and pH1N1, after which lesions decreased in severity by 14 dpi; and at 4 dpi for H5N1, when all H5N1-infected ferrets had either died or been euthanized on humane grounds.

For H3N2, the temporal dynamics of nasal swab virus titers, pharyngeal swab virus titers, and virus antigen expression in the nose were comparable. Together with the lack of virus antigen expression in the lower respiratory tract, these results suggest that the nose is the main source of excreted H3N2. This is supported by the final GLM for H3N2 viral excretion, which included only viral production in the upper regions of the respiratory tract as significant predictor. In contrast, for H5N1, virus titers in both nasal swabs and pharyngeal swabs were already near peak levels at 1 dpi, while virus antigen expression in the nose remained relatively low until 3 dpi. Together with the higher levels of virus antigen expression in the trachea, bronchioles, and especially alveoli at 1 to 2 dpi, these results suggest that the lower respiratory tract is the main source of excreted H5N1, at least until 3 dpi. In fact, the final GLM for H5N1 viral excretion suggests that viral production and damage in the deeper regions of the respiratory tract (bronchi, bronchioles and alveoli) may have a strong negative impact on viral excretion. This may be due to physical obstruction of the deeper airways due to damage caused by H5N1 virus infection and immune responses. For pH1N1, it is more difficult to determine the main source of excreted virus, because virus antigen expression was high at all levels of the respiratory tract. However, the final GLM for pH1N1 viral excretion revealed that only the viral production in the nose and trachea was a significant predictor of viral excretion, suggesting that as for the H3N2 virus, the upper regions of the respiratory tract may be the main sources of excreted virus.",

Attachment of an influenza virus to a host cell is the first step in the virus replication cycle and is considered to be necessary, but not sufficient, for subsequent infection of that cell. Previously, we found that H3N2 attached to many tracheal epithelial cells (predominantly ciliated cells), rare or few bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells, and a moderate number of alveolar epithelial cells (predominantly type I pneumocytes, which have a low metabolism) in the lower respiratory tract of the ferret [6]. However, in the current study, we found very little H3N2 infection (based on virus antigen expression) in any cell types of the ferret lower respiratory tract (Figure 3). This suggests that other factors were necessary for H3N2 to infect these cell types. These factors may be the virus load that may need to be higher for infection with H3N2 and the influence of surfactant that protect against influenza in humans and pigs [17]. We previously found that H5N1 did not attach to tracheal or bronchial epithelial cells, and attached to rare or few bronchiolar epithelial cells and a moderate number of alveolar epithelial cells (predominantly type II pneumocytes, which have a high metabolism) in the lower respiratory tract of the ferret [6]. In the current study, we found abundant H5N1 infection in alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial cells, which fits with the pattern of virus attachment (Figure 3). However, we also found H5N1 infection in tracheal and bronchial epithelial cells, which does not. Next to the fact that this could be related to a different H5N1 strain (A/Vietnam/1194/04 [6], while in the present experiment we used A/Indonesia/5/05), the replication of H5N1 in alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial cells was so abundant that tracheal and bronchial epithelial cells became infected despite the relatively weak attachment of H5N1 to the latter cell types.",

Of these parameters, relative lung weight and affected lung tissue allowed the best quantitative distinction between the virus groups: they showed clear differences between virus groups from 2 dpi onwards (Table 7), with relatively little within-group variation (Figure 2). These parameters have been used with success before for studies on severe acute respiratory syndrome [18] and on influenza [19]. Immunohistochemistry score for virus antigen expression in the alveoli (Figure 3) (Table 7), alveolar edema score, and alveolar hemorrhage score (Table 2) also showed clear differences between the virus groups. However, between-group differences differed according to the dpi, and within-group variation was large. Comparing the histopathology scoring for extent and severity of alveolitis and alveolar damage with the digital scoring for air-containing space in pulmonary tissue showed that the latter demonstrated less statistically significant results, and therefore is less useful for discriminating between viruses (Table 7). Comparing the antigen expression scoring in the alveoli by hand with the digital scoring and the virus titers, the P-values are similar and allow distinction between the virus groups (Table 7). The other parameters did not allow a clear distinction between the three virus groups.",

During this period, the level of virus infection decreased to a low level. By 14 dpi the damage to and inflammation of the alveoli was completely resolved, except for a remnant of mononuclear cells in the alveolar lumina, and virus infection was no longer detectable. The resolution of edema and hemorrhage could be explained on the one hand by the action of alveolar macrophages [20], and on the other hand by re-epithelialization of the alveolar walls [21].",

There was concurrent alveolar damage, which was so severe and extensive that all ferrets either died or had to be euthanized on humane grounds by 4 dpi. This was despite clear attempts at re-epithelialization, based on prominent type II pneumocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia from 1 dpi onwards (Table 2). There was a marked acute inflammatory response characterized by neutrophil influx peaking at 1 dpi but much greater than in pH1N1 infection, with a neutrophil count that was nearly twice as high (Figure 9). This could be explained by a higher induction of pro-inflammatory cytokine production (e.g., IL-6 and IL-8) and NO production due to H5N1 infection [22], [23]. Maines et al. [10] demonstrated a relatively high production of IL-6 and IL-8 in the lower respiratory tract of ferrets infected with H5N1, but not with pH1N1. Similarly, humans infected with H5N1 had high levels of IL-6 and IL-8 in the blood [24]. Another major difference with pH1N1 infection was the low influx of mononuclear cells, with a mononuclear cell count of less than half that in pH1N1 infection by 4 dpi, suggesting that the inflammatory response never progressed beyond the acute stage.",

            "text": "Comparison of the dynamics of neutrophil and mononuclear cell influx in the alveolar lumina with neutrophil and monocyte counts in peripheral blood helps to explain the differences in hematological dynamics among the three virus infections (Figure 9). For H3N2 infection, the slight and transient increase in the numbers of neutrophils and monocytes in the blood at 1 dpi correlates with the mild influx of these cell types into the alveolar lumina at that time. This corresponds with a low demand for neutrophils and monocytes during H3N2 infection. For pH1N1 infection, the marked increase in first the number of neutrophils and then of monocytes in the blood correlates with the moderate influx of first neutrophils and then mononuclear cells in the alveolar lumina. This corresponds with increased demand for both cell types, both of which can be met adequately by the myelopoietic compartment. Neutrophils and monocytes are back to normal levels in the blood by 14 dpi, indicating resolution of the respiratory tract inflammation. For H5N1 infection, the initial increase of neutrophils in the blood at 1 dpi correlates with a massive influx of neutrophils into the alveolar lumina. The steep decline in neutrophils in the blood on subsequent days, despite continued high influx in alveolar lumina, corresponds to a demand that has outstripped the available supply by the myelopoietic compartment. This is corroborated by the presence of immature neutrophils with rod-shaped nuclei in the blood from 1 dpi onwards (Table 5). The lack of increase in monocytes in the blood corresponds with the failure of the acute inflammatory response in the lungs to transform into a more chronic inflammatory response. In addition to changes in neutrophil and monocyte counts, there was an overall leucopenia from 2 dpi (Table 5). Such a leucopenia has been described previously for H5N1 infection in both humans and ferrets [11], [12], [25], [26], whereas ferrets infected with pH1N1 showed higher leucocyte counts [12]. Together, this comparison between inflammatory cell dynamics in alveoli and blood provides insight into the interpretation of hematological analyses of influenza pneumonia.",

The failure to detect virus antigen in any of these virus-isolation-positive tissues except jejunum may be because virus isolation is more sensitive than immunohistochemistry, or because virus was present but not replicating in these tissues. Previously, H5N1 virus antigen expression in extra-respiratory tissue has been found in the central nervous system and liver of experimentally inoculated ferrets [27], [28], [29]. In our experiment, we additionally found virus antigen in other extra-respiratory tissues: for pH1N1 in sero-mucous glandular epithelial cells in the palatine roof, and for H5N1 in mononuclear cells in tracheo-bronchial lymph nodes, tonsils, sternal lymph node, spleen, and GALT of the jejunum, and in squamous stratified epithelium on the tip of the nose. The implication of these sites of replication for the pathogenesis and transmission of these viruses is yet to be elucidated.",

However, the expression of H5N1 antigen in olfactory mucosa (Figure 5) together with high virus titres in the olfactory bulb (Table 4) suggest that H5N1 may reach the central nervous system from the nasal cavity via the olfactory route, as demonstrated recently by Schrauwen et al. [33]. This H5N1 infection of the central nervous system resulted in clinical disease, judging by the presentation of neurological signs (Table 1). In addition to extra-respiratory spread of H5N1, there also was evidence of pH1N1 in extra-respiratory tissues, especially the central nervous system (Table 4), and pH1N1 expression in olfactory mucosa (Figure 5). This suggests that pH1N1 also may be neurotropic and enter the central nervous system via the olfactory route.",

The H3N2 virus was chosen as a representative from a recent seasonal H3N2 influenza epidemic. Like virtually all recent H3N2 viruses the present virus exhibits the oseltamivir-sensitive neuraminidase-associated agglutination of turkey erythrocytes [36]. The pH1N1 virus which had been initially isolated in embryonated chicken eggs was chosen as a representative virus from the 2009 pandemic because it has been used in previous experiments by others [37] and ourselves [19], [35], [38]. The H5N1 virus was chosen as a representative of Clade 2 (subclade 1.3.2) of HPAI H5N1 virus, and has been used in several previous experiments [19], [29]. The different isolates were passaged three times in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells and titrated according to standard methods. Subsequently, the viruses were clarified and reached an infectious virus titer of 1\u00d7107.4 median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) per ml for H3N2 virus, and 1\u00d7107.8 TCID50 for both pH1N1 and H5N1 virus [8], [39].The inoculum for the control group was prepared as follows: MDCK cells were grown up to a monolayer of 80 to 90% in two 75 cm2 flasks (A and B). Virus medium (EMEM supplemented with HEPES, Sodium bicarbonate, BSA fraction V, L-glutamin, penicillin, streptomycin, trypsin and amphothericin-B) was added and the cells were incubated for 2 days at 37\u00b0C. To mimic cellular damage in MDCK cells during virus infection when preparing the virus stock we aimed to reach a cytopathic effect (CPE) of 75%. Therefore, the cells in bottle B were collected by disrupting the monolayer with 3 mm glass beads (VWR, Amsterdam, the Netherlands), sonication (3 times 20 seconds in melting ice) and freezing at \u221280\u00b0C, leading to lysis of all cells. The cells in bottle A were not damaged and the final inoculum consisted for 25% of the supernatant of bottle A and for 75% of the supernatant of bottle B.",

After inoculation, the ferrets received atipamezole hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg Antisedan; Orion Pharma, Espoo Finland) and were monitored daily for clinical signs until maximally 14 dpi [8]. The animals were predestined to be sacrificed at 12 hours (0.5 day), 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 14 dpi (for H5N1 not at 7 and 14 dpi) in order to avoid any bias that could follow from clinical observation, or earlier when they were moribund before the selected time point of euthanasia (H5N1 only). The animals were euthanized by exsanguination after anesthesia with ketamine.

As a control we also assessed the amount of food that was present in the stomach and intestine of the animals on the day of necropsy. Dyspnea was characterized by open-mouth breathing with exaggerated abdominal movement. Additionally, we used four eleven-month-old purpose-bred ferrets, seronegative for antibodies against circulating influenza viruses H1N1 (A/Brisbane/059/2007), H3N2 (A/Uruguay/716/2007), and B: B/Brisbane/60/2008), and pH1N1 (A/Netherlands/602/2009), H5N1 (A/Indonesia/02/2005) and Aleutian disease virus.

Measures of viral production for each region were calculated as the product of the viral titers and immunohistochemistry scores in the respective regions. This was done to take into account the fact that virus isolated in a particular region of the respiratory tract may not be produced locally. Measures of damage for each region were calculated as the sum of the severity scores in the respective regions.
