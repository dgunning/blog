Data on age- and sex-specific population\nprevalence were available for coronary heart disease, chronic renal disease, diabetes,\nhypertension, smoking, and obesity; age-specific but not sex-specific population\nprevalence was available for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\n[10\u201313]. The definitions for these conditions are shown in the\nSupplementary Data. The age- and sex-stratified population prevalence of\nchronic heart disease (CHD; excluding isolated hypertension) was estimated from a study\nthat recorded a prior history of hospitalization with coronary artery disease (A history\nof hospitalization for myocardial infarction or a surgical history of coronary balloon\nangioplasty, or coronary stent implantation or coronary artery bypass.) [10]. We assumed that the age distribution of\ncoronary artery disease is a valid proxy for the age distribution of CHD. Where surveys\nassessed disease prevalence only in older adults, we assumed that prevalence was zero in\nthose younger than the lower age limit of the survey. Because we were not able to source\nrelevant baseline data for Vietnam, we have assumed that the age distribution of chronic\ndiseases is similar in the Chinese and Vietnamese populations.",

This age\ndistribution is unlikely to be due to differences in humoral immunity as the prevalence of\nneutralizing antibodies to H7N9 virus is probably low in all ages [17\u201320]. It might\narise either because elderly people are more often exposed to the animal or environmental\nreservoir of H7N9 viruses, or because elderly people have a greater propensity to become\ninfected or severely ill following exposure. After adjusting for the age- and sex-specific\nprevalence of chronic illnesses in the general Chinese population, we found that CHD was\nassociated with an increased risk of hospitalization with H7N9 virus infection (RR, 9.68;\n95% CI, 5.24\u201317.9). The age distribution of H7N9 patients may therefore be\npartially explained by an increased propensity in persons with CHD (who are mostly older) to\ndevelop severe disease following infection with H7N9 virus. The overrepresentation of males\namong H7N9 patients may also be partially explained by this association, because in China\ncoronary heart disease is commoner in males than females (male prevalence, 0.74%;\nfemale prevalence, 0.51%) [10]. In\nagreement with our results, an age- and sex-matched case control study of 25 H7N9 cases has\nreported that the presence of a preexisting chronic medical condition (excluding\nhypertension) was associated with H7N9 disease (odds ratio, 5.1; 95% CI,\n1.5\u201316.9) [21]. Although only 11%\nof H7N9 patients reported a history of CHD, unrecognized CHD may have been present in some\nindividuals, and other unmeasured age-related factors, such as impaired innate and\ncell-mediated immunity, might also contribute to the observed age distribution of\nhospitalized H7N9 cases [17, 22, 23]. H7N9 viruses isolated from humans exhibit a mixed receptor specificity, binding\nboth \u03b12\u20136- and \u03b12\u20133-linked sialidases [3, 4, 20]. H7N9 virus can infect cells of both the upper\nand lower respiratory tract of humans and ferrets, and disease in ferrets is more severe\nfollowing intratracheal inoculation [5, 6, 20].\nThis raises the possibility that susceptibility of humans to severe H7N9 disease may be a\nconsequence of an impaired ability to control virus replication in the lower respiratory\ntract.",

However, we\nhave tried to minimize these potential biases by restricting our analysis only to\nhospitalized subjects and to variables where data were available for a reasonable proportion\nof all cases. Although the H5N1 patients from China and Vietnam had very similar demographic\ncharacteristics, underlying medical conditions, and behavioral risk factors, there were some\ndifferences in clinical presentation (Supplementary Data), and we cannot exclude that the clinical phenotype of H5N1\nvirus infections may be heterogeneous. We used univariate analysis that adjusted for age and\nsex to explore possible risk factors for hospitalization with H7N9; interactions effects\nwere not assessed and the estimated odds ratios and RRs might be confounded by other\nunmeasured confounders; as such, these risk factors should not be considered to be causal\nwithout further validation.",

The identification in H7N9\npatients of known risk factors for severe seasonal influenza and the more protracted\nclinical course compared with H5N1 patients suggests that host factors may be an important\ncontributor to the severity of H7N9 virus infection. This is consistent with the observation\nthat there have probably been a large number of undetected mild H7N9 virus infections, and\nto date the patients with detected mild infection have been predominantly young (mean age,\n13 years) [7, 14]. H7N9 virus has recently reemerged in China. People with\nchronic medical conditions that are traditionally associated with a higher risk of severe\ncomplications following seasonal influenza virus infection should be targeted for preventive\ninterventions and for early treatment with antiviral drugs should they develop a respiratory\nillness.",
