            "text": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is one of the most dangerous pathogens which cause the highest human mortality and morbidity among various infectious diseases worldwide, particularly in Africa and the developing countries including Southeast Asia. Tuberculosis (TB) indicated a high level of co-infection with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) from 2004 to 2014, and the prevalence of TB cases co-infected with HIV was highest in the African region compared with other regions [1,2]. For these reasons, various anti-TB drugs, such as rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and second-line drugs (D-cycloserine, cephalosporin, viomycin, etc.), were developed for the treatment of TB patients. Furthermore, various studies and strategies on tuberculosis, which causes serious complications to patients and resistance to existing agents, have been carried out globally. ",

            "text": "Recently, new compounds, such as PA-824, SQ-109, linezolid, bedaquiline, ripafentine, moxifloxacin, and gatifloxacin, have been consistently developed as new/repurposed anti-TB drugs through chemical tailoring and remodeling of the existing antibacterial drugs, which are presently being tested in Phase II or Phase III trials [1,2,3,4]. Furthermore, compounds such as pyridomycin, thiophenes, and Q203 have been developed as novel anti-TB drugs [5,6,7]. In spite of these efforts and anti-TB drug developments, the rapid emergence of TB and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) or extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) has consistently worsened the public health problem worldwide. Until recently, medicinal plants used in traditional oriental medicine were utilized as traditional medical resources for treating chronic diseases and/or symptoms which are induced by viral and parasitic infections, hepatitis, and cancer, in both \u201cin vivo\u201d and \u201cin vitro\u201d [8,9,10,11]. Furthermore, recently it was reported that various extracts and/or natural products derived from medicinal plants or traditional oriental medicines significantly indicated anti-Mtb activities/effects against Mtb [12,13,14,15,16]. Thus, effective new anti-TB drugs with novel mechanisms of action, low cytotoxicity, and safety are urgently needed to inhibit and to combat the global tuberculosis epidemic. From these perspectives, artemisinin is an anti-malaria first-line drug derived from the plant Artemisia annua, and artesunate is a semi-synthetic derivative of artemisinin, a part of the artemisinin group. In addition, they are being effectively used as anti-malaria drugs. For this reason, this study started from the hypothesis that artesunate and artemisinin may effectively modulate or inhibit the growth/proliferation of Mtb causing tuberculosis. The main objective of this study was carried out to evaluate the anti-Mtb activities/effects of artesunate and artemisinin which are effectively used as anti-malaria first-line drugs, and to determine their potential as promising candidate drugs for developing novel anti-TB drugs for a safe/effective next generation.",

However, artesunate did not indicate higher anti-Mtb activity/effects than artemisinin in the REMA. These results demonstrate that artesunate and artemisinin have not only anti-Mtb activity which strongly inhibits the growth/proliferation of Mtb, but also unique and selective anti-Mtb properties or functions.

Particularly, when Mtb was incubated with 150 \u00b5g/mL of artesunate, the growth unit of Mtb was detected at 15 days, whereas 300 \u00b5g/mL of artesunate strongly inhibited the growth of Mtb, and the growth unit of Mtb was not detected at 21 days (Figure 3). However, when Mtb was incubated with 600 \u00b5g/mL of artemisinin, their growth units were detected at about 12.6 days. In the MGIT 960 system assay, artesunate more effectively inhibited the growth of Mtb for three weeks compared to artemisinin, and its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was measured as 300 \u00b5g/mL (Table 2). These results indicate that artesunate has a strong anti-Mtb effect that causes the inactivation of Mtb, as well as induces anti-Mtb action that effectively inhibits or impedes the growth/proliferation of Mtb compared with artemisinin.",

Furthermore, artesunate obviously showed its anti-tubercular activity/effect on the Ogawa slant medium by consistently inhibiting the growth of Mtb, and its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was measured as 300 \u00b5g/mL. This result exhibits a similar tendency to that of the MGIT 960 system assay.

            "text": "Currently, various infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, Influenza, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), Zika, and Ebola have caused serious concerns in public health fields worldwide. Tuberculosis, among these infectious diseases, is one of the most dangerous infectious factors, and it was responsible for the most deaths of the world\u2019s population in 2014 and 2015 [1,2]. The increase of HIV co-infection and the rapid appearance of MDR or XDR strains represent an urgent need to develop novel, effective, and safe anti-Mtb drugs for treating TB. For the past few decades, in spite of various efforts to find new anti-Mtb drugs, the development of effective anti-Mtb drugs has still faced great difficulties and challenges. Some anti-tuberculosis drugs, such as streptomycin, rifamycin, and cycloserine, were derived from microorganisms for the development of novel anti-Mtb drugs and in order to block a serious public health threat, and they effectively induced direct pharmacological actions with secondary metabolites and novel mechanisms of action against tuberculosis [17,18,19,20]. The new pharmacological activities or functions of existing drugs used for treating different diseases can provide both safety and efficacy for rapid clinical trials compared with newly developed drugs, which may complement or predict side effects of drugs based on long-term accumulated clinical data. Furthermore, it is required to create effective strategies for the utilization of existing drugs as an alternative for developing effective/safe next-generation drugs, and as one of the feasible solutions for developing novel drugs against global challenges such as TB and MDR-TB or XDR-TB, as well as different intractable diseases. Furthermore, the compounds derived from the repurposing of existing drugs can improve or increase the potential for developing drugs for the next generation, and they can also serve as a useful resource for developing new drugs in the medical field.

From these perspectives, new pharmacological activities/actions of artemisinin and artesunate have been consistently reported since the development of anti-malarial drugs, as follows: (1) the anti-viral activities of artesunate against human herpes viruses such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), human herpesvirus 6A (HHC-6a), and Epstein-Barr virus [21,22,23], as well as the inhibitory effect against hepatitis B virus (HBV) [24]; (2) the anti-parasitic effects of artesunate and artemisinin against the proliferation of Toxoplasma gondii [25,26,27] and the eggs of the liver flukes in an animal model [28,29]; (3) the anti-fungal activity of artemisinin against fungi, such as Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus fumigates [30,31]; (4) the anti-arthritic effects of artesunate and artemisinin against rheumatoid arthritis through multi-signaling pathways in animal models [32,33,34]; (5) the anti-allergic activity of artesunate against allergic dermatitis in rat/guinea pig models [35,36,37]; (6) the anti-bacterial synergistic effects by a combination treatment of artesunate with ampicillin or oxacillin against sepsis animal models induced by Escherichia coli and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) [38,39]; (7) the anti-cancer effects of artemisinin, which are caused by inducing or promoting apoptosis, and by inhibiting the growth of various cancer cells such as breast, colon, leukemia, and prostate cancer cells [40,41,42,43]; (8) the anti-allergic asthma effect of artesunate in a mouse model of allergic asthma [44]. These studies have demonstrated that artesunate and artemisinin have various biological effects/pharmacological actions, as well as the potential to be used as other therapeutic agents. However, in spite of their new pharmacological activities/actions provided through these studies, their anti-tuberculosis effects have not yet been reported or studied. Recently it was reported that compounds such as dihydroartemisinin-fluoroquinolone, synthesized using both artemisinin and fluoroquinolone, induced selective anti-tuberculosis activity [45].",

            "text": "From these perspectives, the results of this study showed the novel anti-Mtb ability/activities of artesunate and artemisinin by consistently inhibiting or blocking the growth/proliferation of Mtb. Particularly, the anti-Mtb activity/effects of artesunate were effectively demonstrated through selective anti-Mtb indicator assays such as the REMA, MGIT 960 system, and Ogawa slant medium assay, whereas the anti-Mtb effect of artemisinin was markedly low in activity compared with that of artesunate. In addition, artesunate showed its anti-Mtb activity and persistent effects by strongly inhibiting the growth/proliferation of Mtb for 21 days with a single treatment. In general, the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria consists of only a single-unit-thick peptidoglycan layer and a plasma membrane. Furthermore, the mycobacterial cell wall is composed of a multi-complex of heteropolymers such as peptidoglycans, arabinogalactans, mycolic acids, and capsular lipids. In this respect, the differences in the specificity and superiority of artesunate and artemisinin regarding anti-Mtb activity/effects were confirmed by sensitive anti-Mtb assays such as the MGIT 960 system and the Ogawa slant medium assay, and may be associated with the susceptibility of Mtb caused by the interaction between various biomarkers, including crucial proteins regulating metabolic mechanisms in the cell membrane system or cell cycle key proteins that cause biochemical reactions in proliferation stages of Mtb, as well as the specificity between the different methods to detect or to evaluate anti-Mtb activity/effects. The important aspects that can be considered at this point in time are that the intracellular signaling pathways of replication and the cell cycle key proteins in the cytoplasm may be blocked or deactivated by the compound at check points that accelerate the growth/proliferation of Mtb, which suggests that the energy metabolism of the plasma membrane as well as biosynthesis related to the multi-complex, biochemical reactions and/or functions of the cell wall can be inactivated or inhibited through binding of the compound and Mtb.

In addition, it suggests that artesunate may act more effectively compared to artemisinin in the blood. Interestingly, this study showed that artesunate and artemisinin did not induce side effects and toxicity in in vivo tests, and that the compound-treated groups consistently induced the inhibition and decrease of Mtb, such as the isoniazid-treated group in in vivo tests. In addition, there were no differences in the survival rates in all groups. The results demonstrate that the compounds do not cause toxicity and side effects in in vivo tests when they indicate selective anti-Mtb activity/effects or inhibit the growth/proliferation of Mtb through their novel pharmacological actions/effects.

In particular, artesunate strongly inhibited the growth of Mtb in a concentration-dependent manner compared with artemisinin. Furthermore, the anti-Mtb activities/effects of artesunate and artemisinin were demonstrated through different anti-Mtb indicator assays, such as in the REMA, MGIT 960 system and Ogawa slant medium assay. In particular, artesunate strongly showed new anti-Mtb effects/actions and its pharmacological effects compared with those of artemisinin in in vivo tests. Furthermore, the animals treated with artesunate and artemisinin showed vitality and/or activity comparable to the normal group in in vivo toxicity tests, which did not indicate toxicity and side effects such as the loss of body weight, vomiting, and diarrhea. The results of this study not only indicated the potential and/or the advantages for the effective utilization of artesunate and artemisinin in medical fields, but also demonstrated novel pharmacological activity/effects and biological actions/functions regarding the anti-Mtb activity/effects. Besides, these results indicate that artesunate has a higher potential for being repurposed through novel anti-Mtb activity/effects than artemisinin. ",
