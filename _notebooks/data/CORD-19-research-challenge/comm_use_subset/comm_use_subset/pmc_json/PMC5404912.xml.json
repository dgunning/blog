ADAR1 alters the RNA coding sequence, because I is read as G, and it also destabilizes dsRNA because A:U base pairs are disrupted than I:U mismatches. These modifications by ADAR1 suppress the cellular responses to dsRNA and prevent to type I IFN production. There are three mammalian ADAR genes (ADAR1-3), but only ADAR1 isoforms p110 and p150 and ADAR2 have deaminase activity (Tomaselli et al., 2015). The IFN inducible ADAR1 p150 isoform (subsequently \u2018p150\u2019) is present in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, while the constitutive ADAR1 p110 (an N-terminal truncated isoform translated from a shorter mRNA initiated at a downstream promoter in ADAR1) and ADAR2 are mostly nuclear. Mutations of ADAR1 result in the severe, sometimes lethal, childhood neurodevelopmental disease, Aicardi-Gouti\u00e9res syndrome (Rice et al., 2012).",

            "text": "Interestingly, ADAR1 can be either pro-viral or anti-viral depending on the virus-host cell context (reviewed in [George et al., 2014]). The antiviral effects are due to hyper-editing and mutagenesis of viral RNAs (Samuel, 2011). Proviral effects are due in part to editing of viral RNAs (Wong and Lazinski, 2002) and/or to destabilizing dsRNA resulting in suppression of dsRNA-signaling through MDA5 and MAVS to type I IFN genes (Figure 1). Accordingly, mutation of either MDA5 or MAVS rescues the embryonic lethal phenotype of Adar1 knockout (KO) mice (Pestal et al., 2015; Liddicoat et al., 2015; Mannion et al., 2014). ADAR1 also antagonizes the IFN-inducible dsRNA-dependent serine/threonine protein kinase, PKR, presumably by altering the structure of dsRNA and thereby preventing both PKR activation and phosphorylation of its substrate protein, eIF2\u03b1 (Samuel, 2011; G\u00e9linas et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2004). However, whereas effects of ADAR1 on PKR activity have been extensively studied, ADAR1 effects on another IFN-regulated dsRNA-activated antiviral pathway, the oligoadenylate-synthetase (OAS-RNase L) system, have not been described. OAS isoforms (OAS1, OAS2, OAS3) are IFN inducible enzymes that sense dsRNA and produce 2\u2019,5\u2019-oligoadenylates (2-5A) which activate RNase L to degrade viral and host single-stranded RNAs leading to apoptosis and inhibition of virus growth (Silverman and Weiss, 2014). Here we report that whereas ADAR1 single gene KO A549 cells were not viable, it was possible to rescue ADAR1 deficient cells by knockout (KO) of either RNASEL or MAVS or by expression of a viral antagonist of the OAS/RNase L system (Silverman and Weiss, 2014). Our results suggest that the RNase L activation is the primary mode of cell death induced by either endogenous or exogenous dsRNA.",

            "text": "Before assessing the role of ADAR in regulating the RNase L pathway we compared the roles of MAVS, RNase L and PKR in mediating dsRNA induced cell death in A549 cells. Thus we used lentivirus delivered CRISPR/Cas9 and single-guide (sg)RNA (Table 1) to construct A549 cell lines with disruption of genes encoding each of these proteins, RNASEL KO, MAVS KO, PKR KO cells as well as MAVS-RNASEL double knockout (DKO). Disruption of each gene and protein expression in the absence or presence of IFN-\u03b1 was confirmed by sequence analysis and Western immunoblot (Figure 2a\u2013c; Table 2). The various A549 mutant cell lines were characterized for their sensitivity or resistance to exogenous dsRNA by poly(rI):poly(rC) (pIC) transfection as compared to wild type (WT) A549 (Figure 3). We initially transfected WT A549 and KO with a range of concentrations of pIC and at 48 hr post treatment cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet. Cells lacking RNase L expression were resistant to cell death at treatment with up to 5 \u00b5g/ml of pIC while treatment of WT A549 as well as PKR KO or MAVS KO cells with 0.5 \u00b5g/ml of pIC promoted cell death (Figure 3a). To obtain a more quantitative measure of cell death as well as to assess the effects of ADAR1 ablation on cell death, we compared the kinetics of pIC-induced cell death with the same set of cells in real time with an IncuCyte Live Cell Imaging System and software (Figure 3b). We also observed markers of apoptosis (caspase 3/7 activity) in real time (Figure 3c). While cells expressing RNase L died by 24\u201330 hr post treatment, cells ablated for RNase L expression (RNASEL KO and RNASEL-MAVS DKO) were resistant to pIC induced cell death (Figure 3b&c). Similarly, RNASEL KO or RNASEL-MAVS DKO showed accelerated wound healing in monolayer scratch assays compared with MAVS KO and WT cells, all of which retained RNase L (Figure 3d). RNase L was previously reported to impair cell migration in these assays (Banerjee et al., 2015; Rath et al., 2015) as well as to promote apoptosis (Zhou et al., 1997). Finally, the protective effect of RNASEL KO was not restricted to A549 cells as human mammary epithelial (HME) cells were also protected from pIC-induced cell death by ablation of RNase L expression (Figure 3e).",

We found that ADAR1 KO is also lethal in A549 cells (Table 3 and described below). Since activation of RNase L by exogenously provided pIC accelerated cell death so dramatically in A549 cells, we investigated whether KO of RNASEL, as well as dsRNA sensors MAVS and PKR, could rescue A549 ADAR1 KO cells from lethal the effects of dsRNA. Using lentivirus delivered CRISPR/Cas9 and sgRNA4 directed at Exon 1 of ADAR1 within the coding regions of p110 and p150 (Table 1; Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1) we screened more than 40 clones derived from WT A549 cells or PKR KO A549 and were unable to recover cells with a KO of ADAR1 (Table 3). The WT or PKR KO clones in which ADAR1 remained intact were apparently derived from cells in which the CRISRP/Cas9 targeting vector failed to mutate ADAR1. However using RNASEL KO or MAVS KO A549 cells and similar lentivirus delivery of sgRNA4 we were able to recover both RNASEL-ADAR1 and MAVS-ADAR1 double KO (DKO) cells (Table 3, Figure 2). We compared the kinetics of cell death in response to pIC transfection of these DKO cells using the IncuCyte system (Figure 4a). While MAVS-ADAR1 DKO cells died more slowly than WT cells, RNase L-ADAR1 DKO cells were almost completely protected from cell death further supporting the finding that RNase L is the major pathway leading to cell death in the absence of ADAR1 editing. As might be expected, the kinetics of cell death following treatment with exogenous pIC (not a substrate of ADAR1) are similar in RNASEL KO and RNASEL-ADAR1 DKO or MAVS KO and MAVS-ADAR1 DKO (compare Figure 3b and Figure 4a).",

As a control, we also constructed a cell line expressing an inactive mutant NS2H126R, unable to antagonize RNase L due to loss of its ability to cleave 2-5A (Zhao et al., 2012). Using CRISPR/Cas9 engineering (sgRNAs 4) we were able to recover ADAR1 KO cells expressing functional NS2 PDE (NS2-ADAR1 KO) but not the inactive mutant PDE (Table 3, Figure 5a) indicating that antagonism of RNase L by NS2 mediated cleavage of 2-5A as well as RNASEL KO promotes recovery of ADAR1 KO cells. Transfection of NS2-ADAR1 KO cells (clone C12) with siRNA against NS2 but not against control GFP reversed the NS2 phenotype, activated RNase L and promoted cell death by two days post-transfection while NS2-WT cells remained alive following siRNA mediated depletion of NS2 (Figure 5b and c). A second clone (C7) of NS2-ADAR1 KO cells showed similar phenotype (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1).",

In order to directly demonstrate OAS activation and RNase L activity by endogenous dsRNA, we quantified 2-5A, the product of OAS, and RNA degradation by RNase L in several types of ADAR1 KO cells in the absence of exogenously added dsRNA. For these experiments we used the RNASEL-ADAR1 and MAVS-ADAR1 DKO cells described above. In addition, for some of the assays we used ADAR1 p150 KO and MAVS-ADAR p150 DKO cells, derived using CRISPR/Cas9 editing and sgRNA6 (Table 3; Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1). Both of the these cell lines are deficient in expression of the ADAR1 p150 isoform (Figure 2a) previously reported in the mouse system to be responsible for the editing of RNA that activates MAVS or MDA5 (Pestal et al., 2015).",

Indeed IFN treatment of ADAR1 KO cells upregulated ISG expression and further induced IFN by endogenous dsRNA in cells lacking expression of both isoforms of ADAR1 (p110 and p150) or ADAR1 p150 only (Figure 6). This was most evident in RNASEL-ADAR1 DKO cells, which retained MAVS. Using an indirect FRET based assay (Thakur et al., 2005) we observed IFN-induced accumulation of 2-5A in RNASEL-ADAR1 DKO and MAVS-ADAR1 DKO cells (although the latter not to a statistically significant extent) but not in WT, RNASEL KO or MAVS KO cells (Figure 7a). Furthermore, while rRNA remained intact in WT, RNASEL KO or MAVS KO cells, highly specific and characteristic RNase L-mediated rRNA degradation products (Silverman et al., 1983) identical to the pattern induced by Sindbis infection of WT A549 (Figure 7b) were observed by Bioanaylzer in IFN treated ADAR1 p150 KO, MAVS-ADAR1 p150 DKO, or MAVS-ADAR1 DKO cells. (It is important to note that the RNA degradation products observed in IFN-treated RNASE L-ADAR1 DKO cells are not the characteristic specific RNase L mediated pattern. The nuclease(s) responsible for these non-specific rRNA cleavage products is unknown.) Thus 2-5A was produced and RNase L activated by endogenous RNA even in the absence of MAVS. In addition to cleaving rRNA, RNase L was recently reported to strongly and site-specifically cleave tRNA-His at position 36 located in the anti-codon loop. The site-specific tRNA-His cleavage was readily observed using a quantitative RT-PCR assay in IFN-treated MAVS-ADAR1 DKO, but not in IFN-treated cells, which lack RNase L activity in the above assays: MAVS KO andRNASEL-ADAR1 DKO cells (Figure 7c) (Donovan et al., 2016).",

However, deletion of MDA5 or MAVS, components of the canonical type I IFN production pathway (Figure 1), was shown to overcome the ADAR1 deficiency and allow the viability of mouse embryos, although most of the surviving mice died within the first few days after birth and there were abnormalities in organ development as well as excess IFN signaling (Pestal et al., 2015). MDA5/MAVS dependent IFN production and signaling involves many pathways and IFN stimulated gene products and it remained unclear which of the these are primary contributors to the death of these embryos, although it has been shown that PKR ablation was unable to rescue either Adar1 KO mouse embryo lethality (Wang et al., 2004).",

It is possible that, in the mouse embryo system, RNase L, activated downstream of MDA5-MAVS also contributes to embryonic lethality. However, rescue of lethality due to Adar1 KO by Mda5 or Mavs KO in the mouse embryo may be due to one or more other MAVS dependent activities. It should be noted that mouse embryo fibroblasts (mef) (Mannion et al., 2014) and HEK293T cells (Pestal et al., 2015) can survive ADAR1 KO. This is likely due to the low levels of OAS expression in these cell types (Banerjee et al., 2014) (and data not shown) and in the case of mefs, also a low level of RNase L (Banerjee et al., 2014).",

Based on these results, we propose that RNase L has a predominant role in promoting cell death by dsRNA (Figure 1). It has been shown recently that RNase L site-specifically cleaves tRNAs and Y-RNAs, and that depletion of the Y-RNA RNY1 contributes to apoptosis (Donovan et al., 2016).",

It should be noted that dsRNA is the only well-established activator of OAS enzymatic activity [ Silverman and Weiss, 2014 and references therein]. While IFN treatment of RNASEL-ADAR1 DKO cells produces enhanced expression of IFN-\u03b2 and -\u03bb, and ISGs, these effects of IFN were reduced in MAVS-ADAR1 DKO cells. Our findings suggest that MAVS is likely to augment RNase L activation through the upregulation of IFNs and OASs (which are ISGs), effects that do not require exogenous dsRNA when ADAR1 is deficient (Figure 6). Indeed, although not statistically significant, the accumulation of 2-5A was greater in MAVS-ADAR1 DKO cells compared to MAVS (Figure 7). Moreover, deletion of MAVS promotes the viability of A549 cells engineered to lack ADAR1 and upon pIC treatment, the MAVS KO cells exhibit a slower rate of cell death than WT A549 (Figure 3). Nevertheless, MAVS-ADAR1 DKO cells die faster than RNASEL-ADAR1 DKO cells most likely because RNase L can be activated in the former cells (Figure 4a; Figure 7b and c). Thus, while the MDA5/MAVS pathway plays a central role in IFN induction and signaling and can upregulate both OAS and PKR (Figure 1), these data indicate that RNase L can be activated in the absence of MAVS expression in MAVS-ADAR1 DKO cells by pIC. These results are consistent with our previous findings that activation of RNase L during virus infections does not depend on IFN induction (Birdwell et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016).",

In mouse models, mutations of genes responsible for AGS, such as RNase H2 (Pokatayev et al., 2016) and Trex1 (Gray et al., 2015), led to self-DNA-mediated activation of cGAS, a protein functionally and structurally similar to OASs (Hornung et al., 2014). Our findings show that mutation of ADAR1 leads to self-dsRNA activation of one or more OAS isoform resulting in RNase L activity and cell death. We suggest that mutations affecting homologous nucleic acid sensors in the IFN system, cGAS and OAS, both of which produce unusual 2\u2019\u22125\u2019 internucleotide linkages, lead to AGS although through different signaling pathways. In vivo evidence for the pro-inflammatory role of RNase L was obtained in virus-infected mice where presence of RNase L contributed to secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2 (Chakrabarti et al., 2015). Therefore, an RNase L inhibitor drug could potentially reduce tissue damage and alleviate inflammation in some circumstances.",
