In Japan, influenza is designated as a Category V infectious disease by the Act on the Prevention of Infectious Diseases and Medical Care for Patients with Infectious Diseases (the Infectious Diseases Control Law) executed in 1999. Based on this law, seasonal influenza is listed as a target illness of the National Epidemiological Surveillance of Infectious Diseases (NESID)1, and specific medical facilities such as influenza sentinel sites are expected to report the number of cases to public health centre (PHCs) weekly. Data tallied up in increments of PHC. The number of patients per influenza sentinel site under the jurisdiction of each PHC is publicly available on Public Health Institute websites. Data on the reporting criteria of influenza are also provided. The administrators of influenza sentinel sites are expected to notify cases every Monday if a physician has examined a patient or deceased individual with influenza-specific clinical signs and symptoms, if a patient is suspected to have influenza or if a patient exhibits all symptoms (i.e. sudden onset, high fever, upper respiratory tract inflammation, and general malaise or other systemic symptoms). Notification is also necessary if all four symptoms are not observed, but the presence of a viral antigen is detected by a rapid diagnostic kit using nasal cavity aspirate, nasal cavity swab, and throat swab. Reporting criteria for sentinel hospitals are separately stipulated2.",

When Rt is higher than 1.0, the number of cases is expected to increase. However, it is expected to decrease when Rt is lower than 1.0. Therefore, Rt is considered useful in the evaluation of the transmissibility of infectious diseases5. However, few studies have reported on the association between Rt and pre-epidemic or epidemic warnings. At present, the reference value of the pre-epidemic and epidemic warning are set based on Weekly CPS, without considering the characteristic of the infectious disease. One of our aims was to confirm the consistency between the two evaluations on the epidemic (i.e. the Rt based evaluation considering factors associated with the influenza epidemic such as human movement, and the evaluation based on current reference value). We also aimed to clarify why secondary epidemics occur by estimating Rt. In this study, a secondary epidemic is defined as a series of infected events, in which Weekly CPS exceeds 10.0 again after it had decreased to below 10.0. This is because the pre-epidemic warning is issued when Weekly CPS is more than 10.0, and the epidemic warning ends when it becomes less than 10.0.",

In all the PHC jurisdictions, one or more phases in which Weekly CPS shifted from a decrease to an increase were observed, and a secondary epidemic defined in the introduction section was confirmed without Takachiho. According to a national population census conducted in 2010, Table 1 shows the population of each jurisdiction and the estimated number of people who moved between jurisdictions. The outflow population was large in the order of Takanabe, Miyakonojo, and Miyazaki city, and inflow population was in the order of Miyazaki city, Miyakonojo, and Takanabe. The ratio of population influx and efflux to the night-time population was large in the order of Takanabe, Chuo, and Hyuga with respect to influx and Chuo, Takanabe, and Kobayashi with respect to efflux. The epidemic ended in the 40th week of 2010, in which Weekly CPS was higher than 0 at least in one jurisdiction. Similarly, the epidemic started in the 27th week of 2011, and Weekly CPS became 0 in all the jurisdictions. Before the start of the epidemic, Weekly CPS continued to be 0 for two consecutive weeks from the 39th week in 2010, and also continued to be 0 for two consecutive weeks till the 26th week in 2011 after the end of the epidemic. Therefore, we evaluated the predictability of the spline model according to the Akaike\u2019s information criterion (AIC), which had the highest applicability when the beginning and end of the epidemic were set at the 38th week of 2010 and the 26th week of 2011, respectively.",

All the Rt values were lower than 1.0 when Weekly CPS value was lower than the reference value for the end of the epidemic warning (i.e. 10.0). Furthermore, once Weekly CPS was lower than 10.0, it exceeded 10.0 again in all the jurisdictions except Takachiho. Particularly, in Miyazaki city, Chuo, and Nobeoka, the value reached 30.0 again which is the reference value for epidemic warnings.

The number of virus detections on the prefecture level and weekly reported cases per sentinel are shown in Fig. 3 since the virus types and the detected jurisdiction were noted until the 51st week of 2010, and no jurisdiction has been noted after that. Although that surveillance did not provide a complete census, A(H3)Hong Kong were dominant until the 47th week in 2010, and infections in Takanabe and Hyuga in 2010 were probably due to this virus type. A(H1N1)pdm09 was detected only in Miyakonojo until the 49th week in 2010, and it was indicated that A(H1N1)pdm09 spread from Miyakonojo. Both A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3)Hong Kong were prevalent in the first epidemic, though A(H1N1)pdm09 was not detected after 8th week in 2011. Therefore, it is reasonable that the secondary epidemics in all jurisdictions except Takachiho were mainly caused by A(H3)Hong Kong. Type B virus was sporadically detected throughout the influenza season from 2010 to 2011, but the association between the epidemic and type B virus was not clearly estimated.",

In Miyakonojo, Weekly CPS was higher than 1.0 at the 14th week in 2011, and the ratios at the 10th, 11th, and 12th week were 2.4, 97.0, and 105.3, respectively.

The ratio was always lower than 1.0 from the first epidemic to the secondary epidemic in other jurisdictions except Takachiho, where no secondary epidemic was observed.

At the 3rd week in 2011, the lower 95% credible interval limits were higher than 1.0 in all jurisdictions except Takachiho. Therefore, it was likely that infection from other jurisdictions could cause the infection in Takachiho, and Rt in Takachiho at the 3rd week in 2011 could have been underestimated. The other feature was that the secondary epidemic was not observed in Takachiho. One possible reason for this might be the lowest ratio of population influx and efflux to the night-time population.

According to the Implementation manual for the National Epidemiological Surveillance of Infectious Diseases Program, sentinel sites for laboratory-based surveillance are to send at least one specimen per reporting interval. If information on serotype and strain is quantitatively clarified by appropriate sampling, it may be easier to more accurately predict transmission among jurisdictions by comparing the viruses prevailing in each jurisdiction.

Because the serial intervals of seasonal influenza, A(H1N1)pdm09 and type B range from 2 to 4 days12\u201318, Rt can be estimated with high accuracy if the reporting interval is set at approximately 3 days. Because weekly reports are aggregated in units of seven days, the average serial interval is greatly exceeded. Additionally, Nishiura et al. also proposed a correction method for estimating Rt in cases in which the reporting interval is not consistent with the serial interval. However, we focused not only on Rt estimation but also on the movement of populations and the consequent movement of infections between jurisdictions, and we used different models in this study. In the model adopted, data regarding the number of infected cases per day are necessary. Because the cumulative cases obtained by weekly reports during the epidemic roughly followed a cubic function, we estimated the number of infected cases per day by applying a cubic spline function as in a previous study19. Moreover, because there were jurisdictions in which Weekly CPS and estimated value by the spline function deviated from each other, it was impossible to deny the existence of a possible bias associated with the estimated value. However, the observed and the estimated values were well-fitted, and the use of the spline function in this study was not necessarily denied.",

Murakami et al. analysed epidemic data from 1993 to 1997 in older regimes and suggested that the criteria for the start and end of epidemics in influenza-like disease was 30.0 and 10.0, respectively20. These criteria were re-evaluated in the year 2007 by Murakami et al., and they confirmed the presence of a few problems even if they were not modified21. However, in the influenza epidemic in Miyazaki Prefecture from 2010 to 2011, the epidemic occurred again even if Weekly CPS became lower than the reference value of 10.0 for the end of issuing the epidemic warning. In Miyazaki city, Chuo, Miyakonojo, Nobeoka, Nichinan, Kobayashi, Takanabe, and Hyuga, the numbers of weeks in which Weekly CPS was lower than 10.0 from the beginning of the first epidemic to the second pre-epidemic warning were 1, 1, 7, 4, 4, 5, 1, and 5 weeks, respectively. Our results indicated that there were two types of secondary epidemic defined in this study. One was caused by the infections from other jurisdictions, as was observed in Miyakonojo, Kobayashi, and Hyuga. In these cases, pre-epidemic warning effectively functioned because Rt was over 1.0 when Weekly CPS was over 10.0 again. However, to predict epidemics with high accuracy in a jurisdiction, the epidemic of neighbouring jurisdictions should be closely monitored. In other jurisdictions without Takachiho, secondary epidemics were mainly caused by the infections from the inner jurisdiction, and it was indicated that the first epidemic had not ended though Weekly CPS became lower than 10.0. There are several hypotheses to explain this. It is likely that the specific virus type was prevalent in the first epidemic, and infection with another virus type spread right after the first epidemic. In line with Murakami et al. who suggested the possibility that the local influenza epidemic would expand22, it is also possible that the distribution of influenza sentinel sites or patients did not have the representative necessary for predicting the epidemic, and Weekly CPS based prediction did not function well enough. In any case, it was suggested that the reference value based on Weekly CPS for the end of epidemic was not necessarily appropriate, and that there can be a limit to the prediction of the end of epidemic by CPS.",

            "text": "Our study has four major limitations partly at least due to data availability. First, the population influx and efflux among jurisdictions could have been over-estimated because the data were not summarized for a single PHC unit in the national population census though the number of people moving between cities is considered. Therefore, it is possible that the movement of populations from one jurisdiction to another could include the movement of populations from one city included in a jurisdiction to another city belonging to the same jurisdiction. However, in line with this, Rt in each jurisdiction may be under-estimated, and the conclusions of this study would not have been substantially altered. Second, analyses were conducted without identification of the viral serotype or strains because of the nature of NESID described above. The third limitation was the availability of public daily data. To our knowledge, there were no publicly available data on daily cases in each jurisdiction and on daily human movement. Thus, any difference between the movement or cases on weekdays and on weekends was not considered in this study. Consequently, there was no other way but to conduct estimations based on an approximated value. However, Weekly CPS could be assumed to have a representative as the data of the week because the pre-epidemic and the epidemic warning are originally to be issued based on Weekly CPS. One of our aims was to confirm the consistency between the two evaluations of the epidemic (i.e. Rt based evaluation and that based on Weekly CPS). Therefore, Rt was assumed to be the weekly altered index in this study. At the same time, if the movement on weekend greatly contributed to the epidemic, Weekly CPS and the weekly Rt might reflect the situation to some extent. To investigate the representativeness of weekly based evaluation, difference between weekly and daily based evaluation has to be compared in future studies. The last limitation is that no difference between clinics and hospitals was considered in this study. It is likely that more patients are examined in hospitals compared with clinics. However, according to the Implementation manual for the National Epidemiological Surveillance of Infectious Diseases Program, patient sentinel sites are supposed to be determined in order to be able to grasp the status of infectious diseases in the entire prefecture as much as possible, considering the distribution of population and medical institutions. Furthermore, the pre-epidemic and epidemic warnings were issued based on Weekly CPS, which is calculated by dividing the number of weekly reported cases by the number of influenza sentinel sites, with no coefficient reflecting the types of influenza sentinel sites. For our aim, although bias could not be ruled out, the impact of the bias would not be very large.",

Considering the original definition of the pre-epidemic warning, the evaluation based on Weekly CPS was consistent with the evaluation based on Rt, including features of influenza. The timing of pre-epidemic warning was probably appropriate. However, the reference value for the end of the epidemic remains to be improved mainly because it did not necessarily reflect the epidemic of inner jurisdiction, at least in Miazaki prefecture. It is essential to evaluate the epidemic situation considering all the available information on the infectious disease, such as viral serotype, viral strain, and the epidemic situation in the surrounding jurisdiction. It is also necessary to establish a methodology to judge the end of the epidemic in future studies.",

In this study, the model uncertainty derived from serial interval was only considered, and that derived from interpolation of smoothing spline was not. The latter uncertainty is likely to be less influential on Ri(t) since all coefficients of determination R2 for estimates by the smoothing spline were over 0.995 and the goodness of fit was not significant in any jurisdictions. The original model was used to analyze the spatial distribution of the Ebola epidemic.
