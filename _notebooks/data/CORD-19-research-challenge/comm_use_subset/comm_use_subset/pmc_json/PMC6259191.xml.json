Although SARS-CoV is evolutionally distinct from other coronaviruses, the viral genes encoded by all coronaviruses, as well as their gene organization, are all similar. The main gene order from 5\u2019 to 3\u2019 direction is ORF1ab, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins [2]. The 5\u2019-most two-thirds of the genome contains two large and overlapped open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b (ORF1ab), whose products are two polyproteins that can be further cleaved by virally encoded proteases [1]. ORF1ab encodes several viral regulatory proteins that are essential for viral transcription and replication [1]. SARS-CoV has a lipid bilayer envelope with the multiple insertions of S, M and E proteins [3]. Inside the viral envelope, N proteins are associated with viral genomic RNA to form a helical nucleocapsid structure [3]. In addition, eight group-specific or accessory genes are interspersed between these main structural genes in the 3\u2019-most one-third of the SARS-CoV genome, there are two (3a and 3b) between S and E, five (6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b) between M and N and one (9b) in N gene [2,4].",

The results concerning the minimal requirement for the assembly of viral like particle (VLP) are still controversial. Studies indicated that either M and N or M and E are sufficient for the formation and release of VLPs [6,7]. Differently, Siu et al. showed that N and E must co-express with M for the efficient production and release of VLP [8]. In viral envelope, M protein laterally interacts with the other two transmembrane proteins E and S [9]. A 12~24 amino acid element located at the C-terminal domain of M exposes to cytosol and physically interacts with N protein during viral packaging [10,11]. ",

For example, SARS M protein inhibits the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathway through a direct contact with the upstream kinase IKK\u03b2 [12]. SARS-CoV M protein could also inhibit dsRNA-induced interferon \u03b2 production by interfering with the formation of TRAF3.TANK.TBK1/IKK\u03b5 complex [13]. The blockade of these signaling pathways may severely impair the host innate and/or adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV infection.

M gene was also fused with the EGFP gene to make the pEGFP-M construct. The effect of siRNA on M gene expression was monitored by both RT-PCR and EGFP expression. Figure 3a demonstrated a significant reduction in M gene expression as the ratio of M to si-M1 reaching 1:8. Quantitation of the band intensity revealed about a 2~3 fold reduction in M mRNAs as co-transfecting with higher doses of si-M1 (Figure 3b). Moreover, a marked inhibition on EGFP-M, but not EGFP expression was observed when administrated with higher doses of si-M1 (Figure 3c). The specificity of si-M1 on M gene expression was further confirmed by using a non-specific siRNA, si-IL17RE, as a negative control. Higher doses of si-M1 but not si-IL-17RE effectively inhibited EGFP-M gene expression (Figure 3d). Flow cytometric analysis indicates that the intensity of EGFP-M gene expression was significantly inhibited by si-M1 but not si-IL17RE as the delivered dose increased (Figure 3e). ",
