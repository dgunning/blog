In China, colorectal carcinoma ranks fifth among cancer deaths, with the incidence increasing annually [3]. Despite improved radiotherapeutic and chemotherapeutic regimens and surgical outcomes, almost half of the colorectal carcinoma patients relapse within 5 years of treatment and inevitably succumb to the disease. The prognosis and treatment of colorectal carcinoma currently depends on the pathologic stage of disease at the time of diagnosis and primary surgical treatment. Unfortunately, disease stage alone does not allow accurate prediction of outcome for individual patients [4]. If patient outcomes are predicted more accurately, treatments could be tailored to avoid undertreating patients destined to relapse or overtreating patients who could be cured by surgery alone. Thus, new biomarkers pivotal to tumor biology are urgently needed to improve prognosis of the adjuvant treatment regimens.",

They exert their cellular effect by specifically activating corresponding transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors [8]. Chemokines are classified into the C, CC, CXC, and CX3C families, based on variations in a structural motif of conserved N-terminal cysteine residues. Approximately 50 chemokines and 20 chemokine receptors have been identified. Chemokines could promote the invasiveness of cancer cells by triggering integrin clustering and enhancing their adherence to extracellular matrix via their receptors [9,10]. Furthermore, chemokines and chemokine receptors could also serve as prognostic factors for cancer outcomes [11,12].",

This molecule was first identified by differential display using normal epithelial cells and head and neck squamous carcinoma cells and was shown to be expressed in many other normal tissues and in various tumors of epithelial origin with heterogeneous expression levels [13-16]. As a unique member of the chemokine family, the receptor for CXCL14 has not yet been identified and the role of this molecule in tumor progression is controversial. Although the role of CXCL14 as a tumor suppressor seemed well established, recent studies suggested that CXCL14 might actually promote tumor progression [17,18]. For example, CXCL14 was reported to be up-regulated in pancreatic cancer tissues compared to chronic pancreatitis and normal pancreas [19]. It has also been documented that CXCL14 transcript is markedly higher in papillary thyroid carcinoma than in adjacent noncancerous tissues and positively correlated with lymph node metastasis [20]. CXCL14 also acts as a multi-modal stimulator of prostate and stomach tumor growth [15,21]. These findings necessitate a re-evaluation of the function of CXCL14 in epithelial tumors.",

Strong CXCL14 staining was mainly observed in the cytoplasm of tumor cells, while partially in the normal mucosa (Figure 1A). CXCL14-positive staining was observed in 54.3% (70/129) of normal colorectal mucosa samples, while in 85.3% (226/265) of primary CRC samples. CXCL14 expression was markedly up-regulated in colorectal tumor tissues compared with normal colorectal mucosa (P < 0.001, Figure 1B, C). Further, high CXCL14 immunoreactivity was also found in colorectal cancer tissues, compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues, by using another antibody recognizing CXCL14, which may rule out the possibility of non-specific staining (Additional file 1: Figure S1B). Most of the stroma cells were CXCL14-negative, although sporadic positive staining on these cells was also observed.

The results showed that SW620 had only low levels of endogenous CXCL14 expression and thus human CXCL14 cDNA was transfected into the cell line, with G418 to allow the formation of colonies. Two clones (clone 1 and clone 2) with elevated CXCL14 were selected for further studies. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting confirmed that CXCL14 was stably over-expressed compared with mock control (Figure 4D). MTT assay and BrdU incorporation assay indicated that the two subclones grew significantly faster than control cells (Figure 4E, F). We performed a colony formation assay in 6-well plates. As expected, the results showed that the two subclones yielded increased colonies compared with control cells (Figure 4G). In addition, treatment with rhCXCL14 protein could promote SW620 cell proliferation (Additional file 2: Figure S2A-C). While shRNA-mediated inhibition of CXCL14 expression in HCT116 cells caused a significant decrease in cell proliferation (Figure 4H-K). Collectively, these data identified previously unrecognized growth-stimulatory effects of CXCL14 on colorectal cancer cells.",

Furthermore, the majority of the cancer cells in the lymph node metastases were also CXCL14-immunopositive (Figure 5A). These phenomena suggested CXCL14 was involved in CRC invasion and metastasis. Several in vitro studies were performed to obtain further validation. SW620 subclones (clone 1 and clone 2) migrated faster than control cells through uncoated membranes in the modified Boyden chamber assays, and were more invasive than control cells as demonstrated by Martrigel invasion. The numbers of migrated SW620 cells of CXCL14-transfeted groups were 64 \u00b1 7 and 56 \u00b1 8 for clone 1 and clone 2, respectively. Meanwhile the number of migrated cells in mock vector-transfected cells was 20 \u00b1 4. Further, CXCL14 induced SW620 cell invasion by more than threefold when compared with the control groups: 35 \u00b1 5 (clone 1), 28 \u00b1 6 (clone 2) versus 8 \u00b1 2 (mock control) (Figure 5B-D). In addition, treatment with rhCXCL14 protein also accelerated SW620 cell migration and invasion (Additional file 2: Figure S2D, E). However, shRNA-mediated inhibition of CXCL14 expression in HCT116 cells caused a significant decrease in cell migration and invasion (Figure 5E-G). These results demonstrated the functional potential of CXCL14 in promoting colorectal cancer cell migration and invasion.",

            "text": "CXCL14, a novel non-ELR chemokine with yet uncharacterised receptor, has been reported to be associated with tumor progression and metastasis [15,16,30]. In this study, we found that CXCL14 was frequently up-regulated in colorectal tumors compared with the adjacent normal colorectal mucosa. This finding is consistent with previous studies that CXCL14 expression was elevated in tumor tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues [19,20,30]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that analyzes the expression of CXCL14 protein in colorectal carcinoma by immunohistochemistry using surgically resected neoplastic tissues. Furthermore, in early stage I colorectal cancer, CXCL14 expression was up-regulated compared with adjacent normal mucosa, suggesting that CXCL14 over-expression is an early event in the development of CRC. It is intriguing to speculate on possible reasons for these high expression levels of CXCL14 during tumorigenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that CXCL14 expression was mainly located in malignant colorectal epithelial cells, and partially in stroma cells. Hence, it could be postulated that CXCL14, similar to other chemokines, is likely to signal through a G-coupled receptor and contributes to progression of CRC via both autocrine and paracrine pathways. Additionally, the levels of CXCL14 expression were significantly associated with some clinicopathologic factors including TNM stage, histodifferentiation, and tumor size. Previous studies have reported that these factors are possible predictors of early recurrence and cancer-death [31-33]. Among them, TNM stage is the strongest predictor of survival for patients with colorectal cancer [32]. The correlation between CXCL14 expression and these factors implies that elevated expression of CXCL14 may be associated with poor patient outcome.",

CXCL14 is therefore a useful prognostic factor for predicting the outcome of patients with CRC who have had a surgical resection of their tumor. Therefore, patients with colorectal carcinoma showing elevated CXCL14 expression should be carefully followed-up, while those with no or low CXCL14 expression should avoid being overtreated. In addition, tumors with high CXCL14 expression had a worse prognosis, even within the same clinicopathologic stage. The staging system, which is based on the extent of the tumor spread at the time of primary surgical treatment, does not always account for the aggressiveness of the tumor itself. From a clinical perspective, the ability to predict outcome within the same clinicopathologic stage is the key to individualizing treatment options. CXCL14, to some degree, helps makes up for the fact that TNM stage per se cannot predict the outcome of patients with the same clinical stage. Although clinicopathologic data dealing with CXCL14 expression at the protein level are currently scarce, increasing attention has been paid to the prognostic significance of CXCL14 in other diseases. Using antibody arrays, CXCL14 has been identified as a potential diagnostic marker of hepatocellular carcinoma [34]. Additionally, CXCL14 have been suggested to be a poor prognostic marker in papillary thyroid carcinoma by qPCR analysis [20].",

In the present study, immunohistochemical analyses and a number of in vitro studies were performed to validate the aggressive role of CXCL14 in colorectal cancer progression. The observation that there was good correlation between CXCL14 levels and Ki67 in human colorectal cancer suggested that CXCL14 was involved in human colorectal cancer cell proliferation. Indeed, we found that CXCL14 enhanced malignant colorectal cell proliferation in vitro. Consistent with these findings, CAF-derived CXCL14 was reported to exert paracrine stimulatory effects on the proliferation of the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP [15]. Meanwhile, rhCXCL14 was shown to enhance the proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cell accompanied by a robust increase in ERK phosphorylation in an autocrine manner [35]. Intriguingly, CXCL14 expression was observed to be restricted to the myoepithelial cells in ductal carcinoma in situ and the tumor epithelial cells in invasive breast carcinoma, suggesting CXCL14 might be converted into an autocrine factor from a paracrine factor [30].",

Additionally, the number of CXCL14-positive cancer cells increased as cancer cells invaded deeply, with more than 90% of the cells in the regions of the muscularis propria and subserosa immunopositive. Furthermore, almost all the cancer cells in the lymph node metastases were also CXCL14-immunopositive. These results suggest CXCL14 may be involved in the process of invasion and metastasis, especially lymphatic permeation and nodal metastasis of colorectal cancer cells. In vitro studies further validated the role of CXCL14 in colorectal cancer cell migration and invasion. The underlying mechanisms of CXCL14-enhanced colorectal cancer cell migration and invasion are not clear. Recent reports showed that activation of chemokine signaling could promote tumor cell metastasis by regulating polymerization of intracellular actins, inducing formation of pseudopodia, and facilitating extracellular matrix degradation and remodeling [36,37]. These findings are consistent with previous studies that implicated altered chemokine expression levels as an indicator of progression to tumorigenesis and metastasis capacity [38,39]. However, few studies have reported the potential of CXCL14 in colorectal carcinoma initiation and progression. In contrast to previous studies in which CXCL14 was reported to be deficient in tumors and acted as a tumor suppressor [17,18], CXCL14 is recently identified as a novel potential cancer-stimulatory protein [20]. Results obtained from the present study together with others indicate a need for further analysis of possible tumor type- and stage-specific effects of CXCL14 in other tumors [15,17,30]. The mechanisms through which CXCL14 promotes or inhibits tumor progression need to be further analyzed.",

The \u201cseed and soil\u201d theory that target organs releasing specific chemokines attract tumor cells bearing corresponding receptors has provided an acceptable explanation for many important roles of chemokine receptors in cancer metastasis [37,40]. Analyses of the effects of GPCR inhibitors with known target profiles and GPCR profiling of CXCL14-responsive and -nonresponsive cells, will possibly be useful for receptor identification. Identification of the factor(s) that cause up-regulation of CXCL14 in tumor epithelial cells is another relevant issue warranting further analyses. Understanding the mechanisms through which the chemokine CXCL14 promotes cell transformation and tumor progression is key to effective therapy. We examined the expression pattern of CXCL14 in CRC and its clinical value based on a small number of cases. Thus, there is a requirement for further investigations to clarify the correlation of CXCL14 expression with the clinical outcome of CRC with a larger patient cohort.",

Additionally, we report the potential clinical value of understanding CXCL14 expression in patients with CRC. On the one hand, CXCL14 could be used as a prognostic factor for poor disease outcome. On the other hand, our studies suggest that CXCL14 expression may be beneficial for individualizing treatment options for CRC patients. One of the challenges to effective therapy lies in understanding the mechanisms through which the chemokine CXCL14 promotes cell transformation and tumor progression. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for developing new therapeutic strategies to effectively inhibit cancer growth and metastasis. Taken together, our study can form the basis for future potential novel tumor therapy.",
