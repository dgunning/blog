It happens when\n                            the arteries that supply blood to cardiac muscle become hardened and narrowed.\n                            This is due to excessive deposition of cholesterol, fatty substances and\n                            cellular waste products in the inner lining of coronary artery. Such a\n                            pathological condition, termed atherosclerosis, can happen in men and women,\n                            particularly at a later age. Aside from genetic predisposition, factors that\n                            account for the risk of\n                            atherosclerosis include dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, diabetes and\n                            smoking.

            "text": "Cholesterol homeostasis\n                            plays an important role in atherosclerosis. Cholesterol is an essential\n                            component of cellular membrane and also a precursor for the synthesis of\n                            steroid hormones and bile acids. Cholesterol in the body derives from two\n                            different sources, dietary intake and de novo synthesis in tissue such\n                            as liver - the major organ for endogenous cholesterol supply. Unlike fatty\n                            acids and triglyceride, cholesterol cannot be catabolized. Excessive\n                            cholesterol must be rid itself of the body via its transportation to liver for\n                            biliary excretion. This pathway, termed \"reverse cholesterol transport\", is\n                            facilitated by high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and is viewed as the primary\n                            mechanism by which HDL protects against the development of atherosclerosis [4-7]. Clinical data\n                            and preclinical studies have conclusively demonstrated that lower HDL levels\n                            constitute an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease. However, the\n                            molecular basis underlying the cardioprotective action of HDL remains\n                            incompletely understood. For better clinical management of CAD, further studies\n                            are warranted to better understand cholesterol metabolism and pathogenesis of\n                            atherosclerosis. \n                        \n                ",

Likewise, enhanced apoD expression is detected in muscle biopsies\n                            from patients with disuse atrophy, a pathological condition that impacts muscle\n                            function and activity of daily living [29]. Interestingly, the induction of apoD mRNA expression is accompanied\n                            by a corresponding increase in leptin receptor mRNA in the immobilized muscle\n                            of patients with disuse atrophy. Immunohistochemistry colocalizes apoD and\n                            leptin receptor in the perinuclear area in the immobilized muscle fibers [29]. These data are consistent with the observation of Liu et al. [30], who show that apoD and leptin receptor physically interact with each\n                            other in the brain. ApoD and leptin receptor expression are coordinately\n                            regulated in the hypothalamus in modulating food intake and energy homeostasis\n                            in mice.

This raises the hypothesis that apoD is\n                            regulated at the post-translational level. In support of this hypothesis, we\n                            incubated aliquots of sera from normal C57BL/6J mice in the absence and\n                            presence of peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F), an amidase that catalyzes the\n                            removal of carbohydrate moieties from N-linked glycoproteins. As shown in Figure 1B, pre-incubation of plasma apoD with PNGase F resulted in apoD\n                            de-glycosylation, as evidenced by the production of de-glycosylated apoD with\n                            reduced molecular masses. Likewise, serum apoD as well as apoD secreted from\n                            axillary glands in humans are also glycosylated [32,33].\n                            While  the physiological  significance of this  post-translational modification remained\n                            incompletely understood, it is suggested that N-glycosylation modulates apoD\n                            protein folding, resulting in conformational changes favorable for binding to\n                            its physiological ligands or association with HDL. In this context, it would be\n                            of significance to convert the two N-glycosylation sites Asn45 and Asn78 to\n                            alanine residues in apoD by site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting apoD\n                            mutants will be ideal molecules for determining the physiological impact of\n                            N-glycosylation on the ability of apoD to associate with ligands and/or with HDL\n                            in metabolism. \n                        \n                ",

Unlike canonical apolipoproteins that are produced mainly in liver and\n                            intestine, apoD is expressed widely in mammalian tissues including brain,\n                            liver, intestine, cardiac and skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and pancreas [34-36] (Figure 2). ApoD does not share significant degrees of homology in the\n                            amino acid sequence with other apolipoproteins. Instead, apoD  is structurally\n                            similar to the lipocalin family of proteins. This superfamily comprises a\n                            diverse class of lipid-binding proteins including fatty acid binding proteins\n                            (FABPs), plasma retinol-binding proteins (RBP) and apolipoprotein M (apoM) [34,37-39]. Despite their dissimilarities in amino acid\n                            sequences, the lipocalin superfamily of proteins share a highly conserved \u03b2-barrel structure that is comprised of an\n                            eight-stranded anti-parallel \u03b2-sheet [40].\n                            Such a tertiary architecture is predicted to form a ligand-binding pocket that\n                            is thought for binding and transporting lipids and other small hydrophobic\n                            molecules [34,37].\n                            This characteristic lipocalin fold is validated for apoD by\n                            Eichinger et al. [41],\n                            who recently crystalized the human apoD protein in its free form and in complex\n                            with progesterone. Cystallographic studies reveal that the eight-stranded\n                            anti-parallel \u03b2-sheets of apoD are connected by four loops in\n                            a pair-wise manner, forming a conically shaped cavity that is capable of\n                            binding hydrophobic ligands [40,41].\n                            Consistent with its structural organization, apoD is shown to associate with a\n                            number of ligands including cholesterol, progesterone, pregnenolone, bilirubin\n                            and arachidonic acid [13,34]. \n                        \n                ",

There is accumulating evidence that apoD plays an important role\n                            in oxidative stress. Do Carmo et al.

This effect seems to be mediated by the NF-kB pathway, as there are several conserved NF-kB\n                            binding sites in the apoD promoter [66]. Furthermore,\n                            Do Carmo et al. [67]show that apoD confers a neuroprotective effect in the\n                            brain of mice. Their studies demonstrate that mice over-expressing human apoD\n                            inneurons, as opposed to normal controls, are more\n                            resistant with a 3-fold higher survival rate in response to human coronavirus-induced acute encephalitis.

The GLaz mutant flies also have an\n                            increased accumulation of lipid peroxidation products in the body, accompanied\n                            by 10-15% reduction in lifespan. Conversely, Walker et al.

ApoD overexpression also ameliorates lipid peroxidation with a 30%\n                            extension of lifespan in flies [70].

Their studies visualize an increased apoD deposition in\n                            atheromatous plaques. Consistent with this finding, we show that apoD is\n                            localized in atherosclerotic lesions of apoE knockout mice (Figure 5). Thus,\n                            elevated apoD deposition along with excessive cholesterol accumulation is\n                            detectable in atherosclerotic lesions of both human and rodent origins. This is\n                            correlated with the ability of apoD to bind and transport cholesterol, raising\n                            the possibility that apoD may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of\n                            atherosclerosis.

            "text": "ApoD is categorized as apolipoprotein due to its initial isolation from\n                            human HDL. Indeed, circulating apoD is bound mainly to HDL, correlating with\n                            the ability of apoD to associate via covalent cross-link with apoA-II. Plasma\n                            apoD is also present at a relatively low content in VLDL and LDL, suggesting\n                            that apoD plays significant roles in both triglyceride and cholesterol\n                            metabolism. Consistent with this notion, apoD polymorphism is associated with\n                            lipid disorders, as characterized by elevated plasma triglyceride levels and/or\n                            reduced HDL levels. ApoD is enriched in HDL isolated from patients with\n                            established CAD. Likewise, increased apoD deposition is detected in the\n                            atherosclerotic plaques of both human and rodent origins. However, a cause and\n                            effect relationship between aberrant apoD production and abnormal lipoprotein\n                            metabolism remains unknown. For example, how do apoD mutations result in\n                            elevated plasma triglyceride levels? Does apoD affect hepatic VLDL production\n                            and plasma VLDL clearance? Does apoD protect against or contribute to the pathogenesis\n                            of atherosclerosis? While apoD is present in HDL in dimerization with apoA-II,\n                            it is not clear how this inter-molecular cross-link affects HDL remodeling and\n                            impacts cholesterol metabolism. Obviously, further studies are needed to\n                            characterize the role of apoD in triglyceride and cholesterol metabolism and\n                            decipher the underlying mechanism that links apoD dysregulation to\n                            abnormalities in lipoprotein metabolism, accounting for heightened risk of\n                            developing CAD in subjects with obesity and/or diabetes. \n                        \n                ",
