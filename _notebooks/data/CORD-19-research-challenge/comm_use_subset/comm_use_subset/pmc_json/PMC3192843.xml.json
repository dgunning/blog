            "text": "Coronaviruses are etiological agents of respiratory and enteric diseases in livestock, companion animals and humans, exemplified by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) which was responsible for a worldwide SARS outbreak in 2003 and caused over 8000 cases of infection with about 10% fatality rate. They are characterized by possessing the largest and most complex positive-stranded RNA genome (ranging from 27 to 31 kb) among RNA viruses. Fourteen open reading frames (ORFs) have been identified in the genome of SARS-CoV, of which 12 are located in the 3\u2032-one third of the genome, encoding the structural and accessory proteins translated through a nested set of subgenomic RNAs [1], [2]. The 5\u2032-proximal two thirds of the genome comprise 2 large overlapping ORFs (1a and 1b), which encode two large replicase polyproteins that are translated directly from the genome RNA, with 1b as the frameshifted extension of 1a. These two precursor polyproteins are cleaved into 16 mature replicase proteins, named as non-structural protein (nsp) 1\u201316, which form the replication-transcription complex (RTC) localized in endoplasmic reticulum-derived membranes [3], [4]. Strikingly, the coronavirus genome is predicted to encode several RNA processing enzymes that are not common to small RNA viruses [1], including nsp14 as an exoribonuclease and guanine N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) [5], [6], [7], [8] and nsp15 as a nidovirus-specific endonuclease [9], [10].",

            "text": "Eukaryotic and most viral mRNAs possess a 5\u2032-terminal cap structure, in which an N7-methyl-guanine moiety is linked to the first transcribed nucleotide by a 5\u2032-5\u2032 triphosphate bridge [11], [12]. The cap structure is essential for efficient splicing, nuclear export, translation and stability of eukaryotic mRNA [13], [14], [15], [16]. All viruses use the translational machinery of host cells. With the exception of some viruses, such as picornaviruses and hepatitis C virus that circumvent the capping problem by using an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) for mRNA translation [17], [18], viruses of eukaryotes have evolved diversified strategies to cap their mRNAs that are thus translated by cap-dependent mechanisms in the manner of eukaryotic mRNAs. It has been suggested for three decades that coronavirus mRNA may carry a 5\u2032-cap structure [19], [20], [21], [22], but the principal enzymes involved in coronavirus RNA capping and their biochemical mechanisms have not been characterized until recently. Cap formation of eukaryotic and viral mRNAs requires universally three sequential enzymatic reactions. First, an RNA triphosphatase (TPase) removes the \u03b3-phosphate group from the 5\u2032-triphosphate end (pppN) of the nascent mRNA chain to generate the diphosphate 5\u2032 -ppN. Subsequently, a RNA guanylyltransferase (GTase) transfers a GMP to the 5\u2032-diphosphate end to yield the cap core structure (GpppN). Then a N7-MTase methylates the capping guanylate at the N7 position to produce a cap-0 structure (m7GpppN) [13]. While lower eukaryotes, including yeast, employ a cap-0 structure, higher eukaryotes and viruses usually further methylate the cap-0 structure at the ribose 2\u2032-O position of the first and second nucleotide of the mRNA by a ribose 2\u2032-O MTase to form cap-1 and cap-2 structure, respectively [13]. Very recently, it was shown that ribose 2\u2032-O-methylation of viral RNA cap provides a mechanism for viruses to escape host immune recognition [23], [24].",

Feline coronavirus (FCoV) nsp16 was also shown to bind N7-methyl guanosine cap (m7GpppAC3-6) and methylate the penultimate nucleotide at 2\u2032-O position to yield a cap-1 structure in vitro [26]. Coronavirus nsp13 has been shown to exhibit RNA TPase activity in vitro and thus proposed to be functional in RNA capping reaction [27], [28], but a direct role for nsp13 in RNA capping still awaits experimental evidence. Currently, the RNA GTase that is essential for cap formation is completely unknown for coronaviruses.",

This mechanism is unique for 2\u2032-O-MTase of coronaviruses and has not been found in any other viruses or host cells. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the enzymatic activity of nsp16 and the stimulatory effect of nsp10 are unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of the heterodimer of nsp16 and nsp10 (nsp16/nsp10) with bound methyl donor SAM and biochemical characterization of the stimulation mechanisms. We found that nsp10 is required for nsp16 to bind both SAM and RNA substrate, and the crystal structure shows that nsp10 may stabilize the SAM-binding pocket and extend the RNA-binding groove of nsp16. These results have implications for designing specific anti-coronavirus drugs to control infection.",

However, we did not observe any 2\u2032-O-MTase activity in various biochemical assays for SARS-CoV nsp16, which was previously predicted to be 2\u2032-O-MTase [1], [29], although a low 2\u2032-O-MTase activity was demonstrated for feline coronavirus nsp16 [26]. We and others showed previously that SARS-CoV nsp10 could interact with both nsp14 and nsp16 [30], [31], suggesting a role for nsp10 in the functions of nsp14 and nsp16. Therefore, we undertook to test the effects of nsp10 on the MTase activities of both nsp14 and nsp16. As shown in Figure 1A, by using radiolabeled and unmethylated G*pppA-capped RNA as substrate (where the * indicates that the following phosphate was 32P labeled, and the sequence is identical with viral genomic RNA except for the second nucleotide), nsp14 alone could efficiently N7-methylate GpppA-RNA to generate cap-0 structure (m7GpppA) (Figure 1A, lane 2) and nsp10 did not significantly alter nsp14 N7-MTase activity in our testing system (Figure 1A, lane 4). While either nsp16 or nsp10 alone did not show any MTase activity (Figure 1A, lanes 3 and 1), the mixture of nsp10/nsp14/nsp16 gave rise to cap-1 structure (m7GpppAm) (Figure 1A, lane 7), indicating that addition of nsp10 and nsp16 rendered the complex active in the 2\u2032-O-MTase reaction. We then used radiolabeled m7G*pppA-capped RNA substrate and demonstrated that nsp14 could not 2\u2032-O-methylate RNA cap-0 structure (Figure 1A, lane 12) but the mixture of nsp16 and nsp10 (nsp16/nsp10) did possess the 2\u2032-O-MTase activity to convert cap-0 to cap-1 structure at pH 7.5 and 8.0 (Figure 1A, lanes 10 and 16). These results indicate that nsp10 may function as a stimulatory factor for nsp16 and is required for the 2\u2032-O-MTase activity of nsp16. While this work was ongoing, similar observations were made by Bouvet et al. [25].",

As both the genomic and subgenomic RNAs of SARS-CoV all start with an adenine, we tested whether SARS-CoV nsp16 2\u2032-O-MTase has sequence specificity by using m7GpppA- and m7GpppG-capped RNAs as substrates. As shown in Figures 1B and 1C, SARS-CoV nsp16/nsp10 complex gave a strong methylation signal on m7GpppA-capped RNA substrate but not on m7GpppG-capped RNA, suggesting that SARS-CoV nsp16/nsp10 functions in cap sequence-specific manner. The VP39 2\u2032-O-MTase of vaccinia virus was used as a control in the methylation assay system (Figure 1C). Furthermore, we observed that nsp16/nsp10 could not methylate cap analogues and individual NTPs (Figure 1B), indicating that the RNA substrate for nsp16/nsp10 needs to contain a stretch of nucleotides linked to the cap. A recent study showed that the cap with a 5 nucleotide extension was sufficient as substrate for nsp16 [25]. In this short RNA substrate, only the first nucleotide is identical with the first nucleotide A in the SARS-CoV genome RNA and the remaining 4 nucleotides are different from the genomic sequence. Taken together, these results indicate that the first nucleotide A is the sequence determinant for nsp16 methylation specificity. These results also suggest that nsp16 or nsp16/nsp10 complex need to form an RNA-binding groove that has enough space and affinity to accommodate m7GpppA-capped RNA with an extension of a few of nucleotides. Binding of the cofactor SAM and substrate RNA to MTase is the prerequisite for its enzymatic activity, and therefore we next tested whether SARS-CoV nsp10 might promote the SAM- and RNA-binding capability of nsp16.",

As shown in Figure 2A, nsp16 alone or the complex of nsp10 and control proteins (nsp12N and nsp3-SUD) were not able to bind SAM at different pH values (Figure 2A, lanes 1, 2, 6, and 7).

ITC profiles for the binding of SAM to nsp16, nsp10 and nsp16/nsp10 complex (Figures 2B, 2C and 2D, respectively) of SARS-CoV showed that the complex of SARS-CoV nsp16 and nsp10 could bind SAM specifically but either nsp16 or nsp10 alone could not. The top panels in Figures 2B-D show raw ITC curves resulting from the injections of SAM into a solution of nsp16 (Figure 2B), nsp10 (Figure 2C), and nsp16/nsp10 complex of SARS-CoV (Figure 2D). The titration curves show that SAM binding to nsp16/nsp10 complex is exothermic, resulting in negative peaks in the plots of power versus time (Figure 2D). However, adding SAM to either nsp16 or nsp10 alone is apyretic, resulting in random peaks around 0-baseline in the plots of power versus time (Figures 2B and 2C). The bottom panels in Figures 2B-D plot the heat evolved per mole of SAM added, corrected for the heat of SAM dilution, against the molar ratio of SAM to nsp16 (Figure 2B), nsp10 (Figure 2C), and nsp16/nsp10 complex of SARS-CoV (Figure 2D). The thermodynamic parameters for the binding between SAM and nsp16/nsp10 complex (N = 0.873\u00b10.0817 sites,  = \u221218.12\u00b111.07 kcal mol\u22121, K\nd = 5.59\u00b11.15 \u00b5M, and  = \u221236.7 cal mol\u22121 K\u22121) were obtained by fitting the data to a single set of identical sites model, indicating that SAM bound to nsp16/nsp10 complex with a moderate affinity in the absence of DTT. The N value indicated the binding stoichiometry and it suggested that the molecular ratio of SAM to nsp16/nsp10 complex is 1\u22361. As the observed N value is less than 1, it may indicate that not all nsp16 bound with nsp10 to form nsp16/nsp10 complex in the assays. As shown by the value of dissociation constant (K\nd), the binding affinity between SAM and nsp16/nsp10 complex was moderate. The mutual binding affinity of SARS-CoV nsp10 and nsp16 was also measured by ITC, and the K\nd value was 2.11\u00b10.97 \u00b5M, which indicated similar binding affinity to that of SAM and nsp16/nsp10 complex. Taken together, these results showed that nsp10 is required for nsp16 to bind the methyl donor SAM and the binding affinity of SAM and nsp16/nsp10 complex is moderate.",

In gel shift assays in the absence of zinc ions, neither nsp10 nor nsp16 could shift the RNA bands (Figure 3A, lanes 1 and 2) but nsp14 and the complex of nsp16 and nsp10 could (Figure 3A, lanes 6 and 3). In the presence of zinc ions, nsp10 as zinc finger protein could bind RNA non-specifically (Figure 3A, lane 5). The complex of nsp16 and nsp10 did not associate with m7GpppG-capped RNA (Figure 3B) and cap analogues (m7GpppA and m7GpppG) (Figures 3C and 3D). These results indicate that SARS-CoV nsp10 promotes nsp16 to specifically bind m7GpppA-capped RNA. To confirm these results, we adopted pull-down assays by using hexahistidine-tagged proteins and radiolabeled RNAs or cap analogues. As shown in Figure 3E, pull-down of nsp16 and nsp10 mixture by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) resin gave rise to high level of radioactive signal for *m7GpppA-capped RNA (where * indicates that the methyl group was 3H labeled) while nsp10, nsp16, or nsp5 alone could not pull down the labeled RNA. Also in this testing system, nsp16/nsp10 complex had a low binding affinity to *m7GpppG-capped RNA and cap analogues (*m7GpppA and *m7GpppG) (Figure 3E). The pulled-down proteins were further checked by Western blotting to confirm the presence of the indicated proteins (Figure 3F). These results collectively showed that the nsp16 could bind specifically to m7GpppA-capped RNA only in the presence of nsp10.",

The thermodynamic changes are shown for nsp16 (Figure 3G), nsp10 (Figure 3H) and nsp16/nsp10 complex of SARS-CoV (Figure 3I) when added to the solution of m7GpppA-capped RNA, respectively. The top panels in Figures 3G-I show raw ITC curves and the bottom panels plot the heat evolved per mole of the injected protein, corrected for the heat of the corresponding proteins dilution, against the molar ratio to m7GpppA-capped RNA. The titration curves show that m7GpppA-capped RNA binding to nsp16/nsp10 complex is exothermic, resulting in negative peaks in the plots of power versus time (Figure 3I). However, all others were apyretic, resulting in random peaks around 0-baseline in the plots of power versus time (Figures 3G and 3H). The binding affinity of nsp16/nsp10 complex with m7GpppA-capped RNA is higher than that with SAM as shown by the thermodynamic parameters for the binding between nsp16/nsp10 complex and m7GpppA-capped RNA (N = 0.840\u00b10.0711 sites,  = \u221218.58\u00b12.171 kcal mol\u22121, K\nd = 1.21\u00b10.41 \u00b5M, and  = \u221235.2 cal mol\u22121 K\u22121). We further analysed the thermodynamic changes when cap analogues (m7GpppA and m7GpppG) were added to nsp16/nsp10 complex in ITC, but neither of the two cap analogues showed exothermic binding (data not shown), which suggested that the cap analogues are not the substrate of nsp16/nsp10 complex.",

The major difference lies in that the structure we solved contains the methyl donor SAM that was purposely supplemented in the protein mixture, and the one by Decroly and colleagues contains S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) which is the product of SAM after methyltransfer and may be captured from the medium by nsp16 that was co-expressed with nsp10 in bacterial cells [38]. The atomic coordinates of nsp16/nsp10 structure solved by Decroly et al. have not been released until now, and thus detailed comparison of the two structures is not available.",

The interaction surface on nsp10 was dominated by hydrophobic interactions in center with surrounding hydrophilic interactions. By using the online software Interfaces and Assemblies of EMBL-EBI (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/prot_int/pistart.html), it was found that significant contacts between nsp10 and nsp16 involve residues 40\u201347/69\u201384/93\u201396 of nsp10, and residues 37\u201348/76\u201391/102\u2013110/244\u2013248 of nsp16 (Figures 4).

            "text": "Biochemical assays showed that only nsp16/nsp10 complex could bind the substrates m7GpppA-RNA and SAM, and execute the 2\u2032-O MTase activity. Therefore, mutations on the interaction surface of nsp16/nsp10 complex which can block this interaction should influence the substrates binding, and consequently the MTase activity of nsp16. A double mutant (H83A/P84A) and a triple mutant (Y76A/C77A/R78A) at the interaction surface of nsp10 were generated. These mutants almost completely abolished the SAM (Figure 5C) and m7GpppA-RNA (Figure 5D) binding of nsp16, and also abrogated MTase activity (Figures 5A and 5B). The main chain N atom of Gly-70 in nsp10 formed a hydrogen bond with Asp-106 of nsp16. The single mutation G70A only slightly influences this main chain interaction, and accordingly, it slightly impaired the SAM- and RNA-binding activity of nsp16 (Figures 5C, lane 3 and 5D) and attenuated by 30% the 2\u2032-O-MTase activity of nsp16 (Figures 5A, lane 5 and 5B). Similar results were obtained by Lugari et al., except for an Y96F mutation, which increased both the nsp10-nsp16 affinity and the MTase activity of nsp16 [39]. In the interaction surface of nsp16/nsp10, the side chain of Tyr-96 in nsp10 stacks to the hydrophobic pocket consisting of Val-84, main chain of Gln-87 and Arg-86 in nsp16. Compared with tryptophan, the side chain of phenylalanine exhibits a stronger hydrophobicity. Therefore, Y96F mutation may strengthen this hydrophobic interaction of nsp10 and nsp16, and thus enhance nsp16/nsp10 MTase activity. This observation suggests that the hydrophobic interaction by the aromatic nucleus of Tyr-96 is more important than the hydrogen bond made by its hydroxyl group for maintaining the interaction surface with nsp16. Taken together, biochemical analysis of the critical residues involved in the interaction interface was consistent with the structural observations.",

Several \u2018hot spot\u2019 residues were located at the loop regions (Leu-100, Asn-101, Asp-130, Met-131, Tyr-132) (Figure S1A). Structural analysis revealed that the loop followed by \u03b1D helix of partner-independent 2\u2032-O-MTases is shorter than that of nsp16 (loop 130\u2013148) and is sustained by rigid \u03b1D helix such as to form a stable wall to keep the SAM inside the cleft. In contrast, in the SAM-binding pocket of nsp16, the corresponding loop (loop 130\u2013148) is long and flexible while the supporting rigid \u03b1D helix is short (Figure S2). Moreover, the loop 100\u2013108 of nsp16 is also longer and more flexible than that in other 2\u2032-O-MTases. These structural features may make the SAM-binding cleft more flexible and thus in need of extra support from the stimulatory factor nsp10. In Flavivirus NS5 MTase, the loop corresponding to residues 100\u2013108 was much longer for unknown reasons, but due to the strong sustaining effect of the long \u03b1D helix, the SAM-binding cleft of NS5 MTase is postulated to be more stable than that of nsp16. Therefore, it appears that at least one stable wall is essential for the SAM binding cleft to maintain the SAM binding activity. In the crystal structure of nsp16/nsp10 complex, one hydrogen bond forms between Lys-93 of nsp10 and Ser-105 of nsp16, and two salt bridges exist between His-80 ND1 and NE2 from nsp10 with Asp-102 OD2 from nsp16 (Figure 6B). Both Ser-105 and Asp-102 of nsp16 are located in the flexible loop region 100\u2013108, which stabilizes one wall of the SAM binding cleft (Figures 6C and S1A), and consequently promotes the SAM binding activity of nsp16/nsp10 complex (Figure 2). This phenomenon of enhancing the SAM-binding activity by stabilization of the binding cleft via protein-protein interaction is observed for the first time, revealing a unique mode of SAM binding among the 2\u2032-O-MTases.",

Structure-based alignment of nsp16 with VP39, NS5 MTase and FtsJ highlights these four strictly conserved residues (Lys-46, Asp-130, Lys-170 and Glu-203) in nsp16 (Figure S2). In the crystal structure, the SAM methyl group stretches out to the surface provided by the K-D-K-E motif (Figures 7B and S3), which are located at the bottom of the central groove, and might bind the first adenine nucleotide, conserved in SARS genomic and subgenomic RNAs, as the acceptor of methyl group during the methylation. This was also demonstrated by the crystal structures of other 2\u2032-O MTases [40], [43], [44], [45]. The central groove of nsp16 is positively charged (Figures 7C and 7D), and the phosphate backbone of the cap-containing RNA is highly negatively charged. These observations indicate that the central groove in nsp16 is most likely the cap binding site. However, the cap binding groove of nsp16 is built by two flexible loops (residues 26-38 and residues 130\u2013148) in nsp16 (Figures 7A and 7B), which replace the highly stable \u03b1-helices (A1, A2 and half of the \u03b1D) in flavivirus NS5 MTase along the cap-binding groove [46] (Figure S1D). Therefore, it is obvious that the RNA binding groove of nsp16 is too flexible and unstable to hold the substrate cap-0 RNA (Figures 7A and 7B), which explains why nsp16 alone shows an extraordinary low affinity for both m7GpppA-RNA and m7GpppA cap analogue in biochemical assays (Figures 3A, lane 2, 3C and 3E).",

As shown in Figures 7C and 7D, the first three transcriptional nucleotides are contacted with nsp16 and the following transcriptional nucleotides are contacted with nsp10. This docking model shows that nsp10 is involved in substrate RNA binding in nsp16/nsp10 complex, as the existence of nsp10 extends the positively charged area (Figures 7C and 7D), consequently elongating the RNA-binding groove of nsp16, which may increase the RNA-binding affinity.",

These results indicate that m7GpppA alone is not long enough to reach the extended positively charged area provided by nsp10 and additional nucleotides following the m7GpppA cap are needed for binding to the nsp16/nsp10 complex. As shown previously, m7GpppAC5 acted as an effective substrate of nsp16/nsp10 complex [25], suggesting that as few as 5 extra nucleotides are sufficient. Nsp10 itself possesses two zinc-finger motifs and has the ability to bind polynucleotides nonspecifically in the presence of zinc ions (Figure 3A, lane 5) [37]; therefore the RNA binding by the nsp10 portion is not sequence-specific. In conclusion, the RNA-binding groove extension provided by nsp10 may contribute to hold the extended RNA chain following the m7GpppA cap and stabilize the interaction between m7GpppA-RNA and nsp16 cap binding site.",

The residue Asp-75 (D75) stretches out to the C2 atom of first transcribed nucleotide (Figure 7E) and may thus functions as the specificity determinant. We also performed structural alignment analysis between nsp16/nsp10 complex and VP39 (PDB entry: 1AV6) at the methyltransferase activity site (Figure 7F and 7G). Compared with VP39, the binding pocket for substrate RNA of nsp16/nsp10 complex appears more limited, due to the existence of residues 74\u201377, especially D75. The amino group connected to C2 atom of first transcribed guanylic acid in m7GpppG-RNA seems too close to the side chain of D75 compared with m7GpppA-RNA, which has no amino group at C2 atom. This structural difference might explain why m7GpppG-RNA exhibits a relatively low affinity to the nsp16/nsp10 complex (Figure 3E).",

In this work, we showed that nsp10 could stimulate nsp16 to bind the methyl donor SAM and the capped RNA substrate. These mechanisms could be explained based on the crystal structure of nsp16/nsp10 complex, and confirmed by mutational analysis. This is reminiscent of the activation mechanism of the N7-MTase involved in vaccinia virus mRNA capping [47]. The vaccinia N7-MTase consists of two subunits, the catalytic subunit located in the C-terminal domain of D1 protein and the stimulatory subunit D12. The activation of D1 MTase activity by D12 is achieved through increase of the substrate and co-substrate affinity as well as enhancement of the stability of D1 protein [47]. Structural analysis revealed that D12 is structurally homologous to cap 2\u2032-O-MTase with a truncation of the SAM-binding domain [48]. In contrast, SARS-CoV nsp10 does not possess an MTase fold and is structurally not similar to any other proteins deposited in the PDB database [35], [36]. Vaccinia virus VP39 protein acts as the viral 2\u2032-O-MTase but it does not require a stimulatory factor for its enzymatic activity [40], [49].",

Our data showed that nsp10 acts as a buttress supporting the seemingly flexible loop 100\u2013108 critically involved in SAM-binding (Figures 6B and 6C) and thus enhancing the SAM-binding affinity. For binding of nsp16 to capped RNA, it appears in the structure that the RNA binding groove in nsp16 has only sufficient space for binding the 5\u2032-cap of the RNA, but for stable interaction of nsp16 and capped RNA substrate, nsp10 is needed to extend the groove and accommodate extra nucleotides following the cap (Figures 3 and 7). The residues Lys-93 and His-80 in nsp10 are involved in the interaction with the loop 100\u2013108 of nsp16, and our results showed that the K93A mutation reduced the SAM-binding activity significantly but not the RNA-binding affinity (Figures 5C and 5D), indicating that this site is essential for SAM-binding but not for the overall interactions of nsp16 and nsp10 [39]. Similar results were obtained for H80R mutation (data not shown). The K93A mutation caused an overall decrease by 60% in the 2\u2032-O MTase activity of nsp16/nsp10 complex (Figures 5A and 5B). The mutational and biochemical analysis of this and previous studies [39] further proved the structural model for the SAM and RNA binding mechanisms. It was reported that alanine replacements of nsp10 in murine hepatitis virus (MHV) resulting in lethal phenotypes mapped to a central core of nsp10 that is resistant to mutation, and the rescued viruses with mutations in nsp10 reduced viral RNA synthesis [50]. As most of these mutations of nsp10 were located at the interaction interface of nsp16/nsp10 complex, they might influence the activities of viral 2\u2032-O-MTase.",

            "text": "The crystal structure of nsp10 in nsp16/nsp10 complex is the same as the nsp10 monomer [35]. Compared the crystal structure of nsp16/nsp10 complex with dodecamer of nsp10 [36], we found that the interaction surface of nsp16-nsp10 has partial overlap with the contact surface of nsp10 within dodecamer. Also the surface of nsp10 which may associate with nsp16 faces to the inner space of spherical nsp10 dodecamer, which does not leave sufficient space for nsp16 binding. This indicates that nsp10 dodecamer structure may not be involved in the stimulation of nsp16 2\u2032-O-MTase activity. However, the existence of nsp10 dodecamer structure during viral infection could not be excluded because nsp10 is translated up to several times more than nsp16 [51], [52] and the surplus nsp10 may form structures other than the nsp16/nsp10 complex. In addition, nsp10 is found in the nsp4-nsp10 precursor [53] and abolishment of the nsp9-nsp10 cleavage site resulted in viable virus [54]. This observation suggests that fusion of nsp10 with nsp9 should not disrupt the essential activities of nsp10 involved in virus replication. In the nsp16/nsp10 complex, the N-terminal part of nsp10, which connects with nsp9 in the nsp9-nsp10 fusion, is exposed at the surface of the complex. The first 9 amino acids at the very N-terminus of nsp10 are invisible in the crystal structure, indicating that they might form a flexible loop. In addition, the C-terminus of nsp9 is located at the surface of this non-specific single-stranded RNA binding protein [51], [55]. Taken together, this suggests that the nsp9-nsp10 is structurally capable of forming a complex with nsp16 and may thus stimulate the 2\u2032-O-MTase activity of nsp16. The nsp9-nsp10 fusion has less propensity to form a dodecamer, which may further weaken the biological relevance of the nsp10 dodecamer structure observed previously [36].",

It was shown that nsp10 could interact with both 2\u2032-O-MTase nsp16 and N7-MTase nsp14 [30], [31], suggesting that a single nsp10 molecule or its dimer could associate with both nsp16 and nsp14 at the same time in the RTC. Thus, one model can be proposed to explain the RNA cap methylation during coronavirus replication: After translation and processing of polyproteins 1a and 1ab, the mature nsp14, nsp16 and nsp10 form the RNA methylation apparatus, where SAM is bound by nsp14 and nsp16 in the presence of nsp10. The newly transcribed viral RNA is capped by the unknown capping enzyme (GTase) and bound to nsp10. The 5\u2032-end of the RNA is first associated with nsp14 and methylated at the N7 position of the cap guanine. Next, the conformation of the RNA-protein complex is altered, and the 5\u2032-end of viral RNA is transferred from the RNA-binding groove of nsp14 to that of nsp16, resulting in second methylation at the 2\u2032-O-site in the ribose of the first nucleotide following the cap. Further experiments are needed to confirm this model.",

However, the genomes of RNA viruses are very small in comparison with DNA genomes and usually encode just a few genomic and subgenomic mRNAs with conserved 5\u2032-ends. It has been shown that the flavivirus MTases are sequence-dependent [42], [56]. In our previous work, we showed that the SARS-CoV nsp14 N7-MTase is sequence-unspecific as it could methylate the RNA cap of different RNAs both in vitro and in yeast cells [8]. However, in the current study, we showed that the nsp16 2\u2032-O-MTase is sequence-dependent as it could only methylate m7GpppA-capped RNA, where the first nucleotide is absolutely restricted to adenosine. Structural modeling analysis suggests that the amino residues at positions 74\u201377 of nsp16 may be the determinant for such sequence specificity (Figures 7C, 7D and 7E). In addition, the unknown coronavirus GTase may also contribute to the specificity of coronavirus capping enzymes. In coronavirus life cycle, genomic RNA replication and subgenomic RNA transcription take place in association with double-membrane vesicle [3], and this physical restriction may make the capping apparatus accessible only to viral RNAs.",

Very recently, it was found that 2\u2032-O-methylation of the viral RNA cap is essential for RNA viruses to avoid innate immune recognition by the host immune system [23], [24]. Thus, inhibition of viral MTase activity should be able to suppress viral replication and attenuate viral virulence in infection and pathogenesis. The MTase active site has been suggested as a drug target for developing antiviral drugs [57], [58], [59]. However, the MTase fold is structurally conserved between viral and cellular MTases, and it is thus difficult to obtain antiviral compounds with high specificity targeting MTase active sites. For this reason, it looks more promising to target the interface of nsp16 and nsp10, which is unique to coronaviruses.",

Nsp16 is shown as ribbon and electrostatic potential surface with 20% transparency. Nsp10 is shown as ribbon (C) or electrostatic potential surface with 20% transparency (D). SAM is shown as sticks and colored in yellow. The methyl group of SAM is colored in blue. Zinc ions are shown as spheres. The m7GpppA-RNA is shown as sticks and the first two nucleotides are colored by atoms (C: green, O: red, N: blue, P: orange) and the next nucleotides are colored in magenta. Structural alignment of methyltransferase activity site from VP39 (PDB entry: 1AV6) and SARS-CoV nsp16 docking with m7GpppA-RNA (F) or m7GpppG-RNA (G), respectively. VP39 is superimposed with SARS-CoV nsp16 (F, G). VP39 is shown as surface and colored in orange, and nsp16 is shown as ribbon and colored in green, with Asp-75 (D75) shown as sticks and colored in cyan.",
