These injuries occur in various places during various activities [2] and change in their patterns over time [3\u20136]. For example, sports participation is promoted to increase physical activity among children in most developed countries [7, 8], and participation in sports and leisure activities is increasing among this population [4, 5, 9]. By contrast, other activities in daily life, such as walking, tend to decrease [5, 6, 10]. Therefore, a comprehensive survey of pediatric traumatic injuries that is constantly updated is needed.",

Fracture was relatively common after the age of 5 years, and was the most common injury type in children aged >11 years (Table 4). Considering that fractures affecting the lower extremities are often associated with sports or leisure activities [28, 29], findings suggest that lower-extremity injuries become more common as children grow older because of increased participation in such activities. This assumption is supported by the finding that older children exhibited an increased rate of injuries outside the home (Fig 3A) and a large increase in the frequency of injuries during May and June, which are suitable months for outdoor activities in authors\u2019 country because there are many holidays and the temperature is adequate (Fig 3B).",

This finding could indicate that pediatric injuries frequently occur in this period; however, it could also be a result of patients visiting the outpatient clinic rather than the ED during earlier periods (9 am to 5 pm) or be due to difficulties among parents in accessing healthcare facilities given the high proportion of young working couples in authors\u2019 country (http://www.index.go.kr/potal/main/EachDtlPageDetail.do?idx_cd=3037). These same interpretations could be used to explain the higher number of visits on holidays and weekends in both datasets (Table 2). More research is needed to determine the cause underlying the increased frequency of visits during the evening or on holidays; however, it is clear that sufficient numbers of emergency medical personnel should be made available to attend to pediatric trauma cases during these busy periods.",

First, the medical environments for trauma differ by country; therefore, it is difficult to determine whether these data are generalizable outside of South Korea. Nevertheless, as the general lifestyle and medical environment become more similar globally [1], results of the present study are likely to become applicable to many countries with similar socioeconomic conditions to ours. Second, although the NHISS and single-institutional data were similar in many aspects, it is necessary to recognize the possibility of selection bias caused by referrals of more severe cases to our institute, which is a tertiary referral hospital. Third, there may be limitations regarding the use of sample data. The sample cohort used in the present study were randomly selected and stratified data reflecting approximately 1 million claims records per year; therefore, the sample data may not reflect medical utilization among the total population, and further comprehensive studies may be needed.",

Based on the similarities between both datasets, the detailed results of the single-institutional data could be extended and applied nationally with adequate external validity. Despite the declining pediatric population, the incidence of pediatric traumatic injuries has increased, including the proportions of indoor playground and trampoline-related injuries. The increase of pediatric traumatic injuries may be partially a result of the increased availability of indoor playgrounds and installation of trampolines. Preventive guidelines have been published, but stricter adherences to their use would be needed. The most commonly injured body part was the head, followed by the upper extremities distal to the elbow (elbow to hand) and the lower extremities distal to the knee (knee to foot). Injuries of the trunk or proximal extremities such as the shoulders or hips were rare. To prevent traumatic injuries in children, it may be more effective to wear protective gear covering the head and extremities distal to the elbow or knee, rather than the trunk or proximal extremities. For preschoolers (aged <5 years), low-energy injuries of the head were most common; therefore, simple clothing such as caps could prevent many injuries in this age group. Among children aged \u2265 5 years, the rates of lower-extremity injuries, fractures, and injuries occurring outside the home increased, and seasonal variation (peak incidence in May and June) became evident. Protective guidelines for outdoor sports and leisure activities are necessary for these children. Visits to the ED peaked between 7 and 10 pm, and on holidays and weekends. Policies to increase medical support for pediatric trauma in the ED during these periods should be considered. The present results could facilitate the establishment of preventive measures, such as educational programs, to improve the safety of children.",

The incidence rate tended to increase during the 10-year study period (\u03b2 = 0.877, p = 0.001). The decrease in 2015 may be explained by the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome, when there was an attempt to reduce emergency department visits to prevent the spread of the virus. (B) Single-institutional data for visiting patients by year. The number of injured patients tended to increase over the study period (\u03b2 = 0.933, p < 0.001) with more rapid changes occurring after 2010, which coincides with the opening of a pediatric emergency center in December of that year. (C) When the numbers of cases of single-institutional data were weighted for age and body part using the NHISS data, there was a greater increase in the single-institutional data. (D) NHISS data for the standardized injury incidence rate per 1 million claim cases by year. Although there appeared to be a greater increase in the single-institutional data in Fig 2C, the rate of increase in the NHISS data became more rapid after standardization to the population composition in 2006 (\u03b2 = 0.964, p < 0.001). Despite a decreased proportion of children aged 0\u201314 years, the injury incidence rate increased over time.
