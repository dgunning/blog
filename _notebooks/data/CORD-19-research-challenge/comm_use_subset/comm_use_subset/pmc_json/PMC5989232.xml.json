TLR4 signaling activates the MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88)- and TRIF (TIR domain-containing adaptor protein-inducing interferon-\u03b2)-dependent pathways to induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines and interferons (IFNs), respectively1\u20134. Since the discovery of TLR4 as a receptor for LPS, several non-LPS TLR4 ligands, which are mostly derived from microbes, have been identified and their roles in TLR4-mediated innate immune responses have been proposed5\u20138. During the onset of intestinal inflammation in response to PAMPs from colon and possibly non-LPS TLR4 ligands from diet, TLR4 signaling is likely to play an important role in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and immune cells, including, macrophages and dendritic cells. IFN and/or inflammatory cytokines produced in the intestine upon stimulation by these PAMPs would systemically act on virus-infected cells locally and/or far away from sites where IFN signaling was initially induced. However, TLR4 signaling in the small intestine is not well characterized9.",

Despite the breadth of potential antiviral drugs tested in vitro using a HuNoV replicon culture system17, limited studies have validated the efficacy of these drugs in vivo18\u201320. There are no reports on safe, prophylactic antiviral drugs that could prevent the onset of acute gastroenteritis in immunocompromised hosts.

In the absence of a robust cell culture system for HuNoV31, we used murine norovirus 1 (MNV-1), as a surrogate model for HuNoV, to test for the inhibition of virus-induced cell death by \u03b3-PGA. We first determined the range of multiplicity of infection (MOI) of MNV in which viral infection-induced apoptosis is triggered during the course of viral infection. As shown in Fig. 1a, infection of RAW264.7 cells with MNV at an MOI of \u22650.005 produced \u22651 \u00d7 1011 viral RNA copies/ml of media within 30 h. With an MOI \u22640.0005, there was a >10-fold reduction in viral RNA levels, delaying the progress of cell death within 2 days. Accordingly, we used an MOI of 0.005 for infecting cells to assess the impact of \u03b3-PGA. As shown in Fig. 1b, treatment with 2,000-kDa \u03b3-PGA significantly inhibited MNV infection-induced cell death as visualized by live cell staining, with a 4.4-fold increase in IFN-\u03b2 mRNA expression than in non-treated control cells. \u03b3-PGA dose-dependently prevented virus-induced cell death resulting in increased cell viability (from approximately 40% to 80% at 200 nM; Fig. 1c), demonstrating the potent antiviral activity of this non-canonical TLR4 ligand against MNV.",

Its inhibitory effect decreased slightly (86% inhibition) at an MOI of 0.05 (Fig. 2a). Additionally, it led to a 30% reduction in the level of Norwalk virus sub-genomic replicon (derived from a GI strain of HuNoV) at 100 nM. In HG23 cell line, 500-kDa \u03b3-PGA had little impact on the replication of sub-genomic replicon (Fig. 2b). The HG23 replicon cell line derived from the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Huh7 normally fails to respond to TLR4 ligands because of the low-level expression of TLR4 expression together with the lack of the expression of its accessory proteins, CD14 and MD26. Thus, the insufficient, transient expression of TLR4 and the associated accessory proteins might have contributed to the relatively lower inhibitory effect. The critical role of these accessory proteins in \u03b3-PGA sensing and TLR4-mediated IFN-\u03b2 expression was further investigated in human embryonic kidney 293 T cells (HEK293T), which express no endogenous TLR4, MD2, and CD1433,34. By confocal microscopy, we found that \u03b3-PGA sensing and intracellular entry occurred upon ectopic expression of both TLR4 and its two known accessory factors (Supplementary Fig. 2a\u2013c). Substantial induction of IFN-\u03b2 expression and IRF-3 activation were observed only when TLR4, MD2, and CD14 were expressed (Supplementary Fig. 2d). This TLR4-mediated IFN-\u03b2 induction capability of \u03b3-PGA was also verified in RAW264.7 cells in which RNAi-mediated depletion of TLR4 abrogated IFN-\u03b2 expression and IRF-3 activation (Supplementary Fig. 2e).",

To this end, distal part of the ileum with or without PPs was retrieved from BALB/c mice. These were treated with \u03b3-PGA in culture dishes for 18 h ex vivo. After treatment, the villi released into the culture media and the remaining basal body of the ileum (ileal submucosa and lamina propria) were collected separately and the IFN-\u03b2 mRNA levels were quantified in these ileal compartments by reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) (Fig. 3a). Interestingly, we found induction of IFN-\u03b2 production by \u03b3-PGA only in the villi (compartments II and IV) and not in PPs and basal body of the ileum (compartments III and I) (Fig. 3b). This induction was more substantial in the villi derived from the ileum with PPs (compartment II) than from the ileum without PPs (compartment IV). TLR4-stained cells were more abundant in compartment II than in compartment IV (Fig. 3c). These results suggest that to activate TLR4 signaling, \u03b3-PGA transverses the epithelial cell layer of the villi to reach the laminar propria bearing TLR4-positive macrophages and dendritic cells. Despite the abundance of TLR4-positive cells in PPs, \u03b3-PGA treatment did not significantly induce IFN-\u03b2 mRNA expression, suggesting non-responsiveness of PPs to \u03b3-PGA by an as-yet-unknown mechanism.",

Fluorescence microscopic analysis of Q-dot-conjugated viruses detected MNV particles in compartment II. No prominent sign of virion entry was detected through the villi at the ileum without PPs (Fig. 3d). These results demonstrate that MNV primarily enters into the ileum bearing PPs through intestinal villi, possibly via M cells or transepithelial dendritic cells. To confirm the entry of MNV through this part of the ileum, viral genome was monitored upon delivering Q-dot-conjugated MNV directly to the small intestine of mouse ex vivo. High levels of viral genome was detected in the ileum with PPs [in both compartment I representing PPs and compartment II] 8 h after virus delivery (Supplementary Fig. 3a), in agreement with our results showing MNV particles within villi. Consequently, enhanced IFN-\u03b2 mRNA levels were detected in both ileal compartments while greater induction was observed in ileal PPs (iPPs) early during virus infection (Supplementary Fig. 3b,c), suggesting that MNV entering through villi reached to the PPs to infect ileal sentinel cells.

The ileum with PPs of norovirus-infected mice showed no significant increase in TLR4 expression. Expression levels of TLR2, TLR3, TLR6, TLR8, and TLR9 were slightly increased. Though the increase was less than 2-fold, it was statistically significant (Fig. 6a). The expression of TLR1, which recognizes peptidoglycan and lipoproteins43,44, and TLR5, which recognizes bacterial flagellin45 was upregulated by ~5-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively, suggesting the possibility of crosstalk between TLR signaling through some of these upregulated TLRs. This might have contributed to the amplification of \u03b3-PGA-mediated TLR4 signaling in vivo as several TLR downstream signaling pathways share transcription factors such as NF-\u03baB and IRF-335, used for type I IFN production. In MLNs, expression levels of TLR2, TLR4, TLR6, TLR7, and TLR8 were slightly decreased (less than 2-fold) (Fig. 6b). These results suggest differentially altered TLR expression profile for norovirus infection in the ileum with PPs and MLNs in vivo. Interestingly, this expression profile of TLRs was different from that seen in virus-infected RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 2F), suggesting the involvement of commensal microbiota in the regulation of TLR expression in the ileum, in the context of norovirus infection in mice.",

Previous studies have reported the primary activation of MyD88-dependent pathway by LPS in eliciting the secretion of numerous proinflammatory cytokines1\u20134,8. As a TLR4 ligand, \u03b3-PGA is distinct from LPS in selectively increasing the serum IFN-\u03b2 titers, but not of other inflammatory cytokines, namely IL-1\u03b1/\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1. This difference in the cytokine profile induced by \u03b3-PGA and LPS suggests that a regulatory network different from that of LPS should control \u03b3-PGA-mediated TLR4 activation. It remains unclear whether other non-LPS TLR4 ligands including endogenous TLR4 agonists such as heat shock proteins and cholesteryl ester hydroperoxides8 upon being sensed by the same receptor also behave differently than LPS in terms of the cytokine profile. Another unexpected finding was that the elevated serum IFN-\u03b2 levels in mice after multiple oral administrations of \u03b3-PGA (once daily for three days) neither increased nor decreased following two additional oral administrations. These results suggest the absence of tolerance phenomena with \u03b3-PGA, which is normally seen with endotoxin, or LPS, wherein, innate immune cells pre-exposed to LPS become refractory to subsequent challenges47. Based on the results of our present study, \u03b3-PGA seems to be a new class of TLR4 agonists that selectively activates the TRIF-dependent pathway.",

Minimal TLR4 expression was seen in normal IECs and the lamina propria rich in scattered inflammatory cells in human biopsies48. Although not thoroughly characterized, a previous study had indicated the expression of TLR4 as well as other TLRs (TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR5, and TLR9) in the enterocytes of small intestine49. By immunohistochemistry, we observed no prominent TLR4-staining patterns on apical or basolateral surfaces of IECs; TLR4-positive cells were instead localized in the lamina propria of villi and the PPs in the ileum. Thus, our results together with previous findings provide evidence of TLR4 expression in the ileum. However, its fine localization are yet to be well defined. Low but detectable level of TLR4 expression explains its role at the distal ileum that is continuously exposed to microbes and their products transferred from colon50. This renders the ileum or IECs hyposensitive to PAMPs including LPS and other TLR agonists, thereby preventing aberrant production of proinflammatory cytokines. In this regard, induction of IFN-\u03b2 in ex vivo cultures of mouse ileum and in mice receiving \u03b3-PGA perorally was surprising, particularly in the absence of upregulation of TLR4 expression by \u03b3-PGA in RAW264.7 cells and in mouse ileum with PPs.",

Accordingly, in the present study, \u03b3-PGA delivered orally seemed to be internalized into IECs or transverses the tight junctions between enterocytes to be internalized into the sentinel cells in the lamina propria to induce IFN-\u03b2 production. Thus, we further investigated as to how \u03b3-PGA reached a site where functional interaction with TLR4 occurred in the ileum. The first barrier for the entry of \u03b3-PGA was the mucus layer, where access of \u03b3-PGA to the small intestine is more likely to occur as it is covered by a thinner mucus layer compared to the colon51. For induction of IFN production, \u03b3-PGA needs to be sensed by TLR4 in and/or on villi. Immunostaining revealed lack of overlapping between TLR4 staining and villin, a cytoskeletal protein specific to villi in the ileum, indicating a barely detectable level of TLR4 at the apical site of IECs. We therefore hypothesized a model in which \u03b3-PGA transverses the tight junctions between enterocytes to be sensed by sentinel cells such as dendritic cells within villi or is directly uptaken by transepithelial dendrites (Supplementary Fig. 5). Expression of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA was significantly enhanced solely in the villi with lack of noticeable IFN-\u03b2 induction in PPs. Absence of response to \u03b3-PGA in PPs resulting in lack of inflammation was consistent with the previous findings suggesting anergy of intestinal macrophages. Anergy was mediated by their inability to activate NF-\u03baB, and low-level expression of TLR4 and its accessory factors CD14 and MD252.",

Dependence on CD14 in MyD88-dependent pathway-mediated induction of TNF-\u03b1 was marginal in LPS-stimulated macrophages53,54.

However, norovirus infection led to a ~2-fold increase in the expression of most TLRs, except TLR4 and TLR6 (Fig. 6a). TLR1 level was increased ~5-fold. Upregulated TLR expression could be in part due to the infiltration of leukocytes to the infected ileum. We envision that TLR4 signaling activation by \u03b3-PGA might be potentiated through crosstalks with other upregulated TLRs. Among the upregulated TLRs, the endosomal TLRs including TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 may influence the sensitivity of TLR4 to \u03b3-PGA early during norovirus infection. Currently, their involvement (except TLR3) in innate immune response to norovirus infection remains unknown24,55. Although norovirus infection did not affect the expression of TLR4 in the ileum, TLR responses to colon-resident microbiota and/or PAMPs derived from them might influence the downstream cascade of TLR4 signaling.

            "text": "Type I IFN plays a major role in clearing mouse norovirus24\u201326. It is effective in limiting norovirus replication in human norovirus sub-genomic replicon culture system17. In spite of the well-established antiviral potency of type I IFN against noroviruses, IFN therapy is not translated into clinical practice because subcutaneous or intramuscular injection of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 is associated with various side effects56,57. Our results, demonstrating the prophylactic antiviral activity of \u03b3-PGA in mice using MNV-1 as a model for enteric viruses infecting the small intestine, accentuates its potential use as a safe and prophylactic candidate for the treatment of acute norovirus infection. Although norovirus infection is typically limited to an acute infection that lasts for 2\u20133 days in most healthy subjects58, it is associated with significant clinical outcomes with ~200,000 deaths related with gastroenteritis in children under 5 years of age59. In young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients for whom IFN might not be the best treatment option, \u03b3-PGA can be used as an alternative prophylactic antiviral agent for HuNoV. It is important to note that unlike the MNV replicating mainly in macrophages and dendritic cells25, HuNoV, which was shown to replicate in B cells36, also targets IECs60\u201362. Therefore, the IFN produced by the sentinel cells in the lamina propria of villi upon sending the \u03b3-PGA might restrict HuNoV infection more effectively at the early stage of infection by acting on nearby IECs through paracrine signaling.",
