When multiple pathogens infect the same tissue, they form diverse communities, effectively sharing an ecological niche that provides the opportunity for interspecific interactions [1\u20133]. It is known that pathogen interactions may alter the within-host dynamics of infection with consequences for the population transmission of some common infections. Interactions among microorganisms include the promoting or inhibiting effects of gut microbiota on invading pathogenic bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract [4]; the enhanced carriage of pneumococcal bacteria following influenza infection in the respiratory tract [5]; the rise in human monkeypox after eradication of smallpox [6]; and immune-driven enhancement of Zika virus infection following Dengue virus exposure [7]. The complex ecology of pathogen communities therefore has potentially important implications for the epidemiology and control of infectious diseases.",

Pathogen interactions can be cooperative or competitive and can occur within a host or in a population where pathogens co-circulate [9]. While some evidence of population-level interactions between pathogens exists, statistical support for the occurrence of pathogen-pathogen interactions from multiple non-stationary time series independent of prior biological or ecological knowledge is lacking. This is due in part to a paucity of appropriate long-term time series data that describe infection frequencies for multiple pathogens simultaneously, allowing such interactions to be identified, but also due to statistical techniques that are limited in their ability to handle such complex datasets [10, 11].",

Statistical methods for handling non-stationary time series data include multiple regression and generalised additive models, which are able to capture non-linear trends and explanatory factors such as seasonality and climate as well as other confounders and typically model a univariate health outcome as opposed to a multivariate distribution of several non-independent outcomes [12\u201318]. Consequently, they do not necessarily focus on estimating pathogen-pathogen interactions. More specialist techniques that focus on decomposition of the time series include singular spectrum analysis and wavelet analysis. Singular spectrum analysis has been used to model interactions between a pathogen and an environmental factor [19], whilst wavelet decomposition has been used to infer pathogen-pathogen interactions [20] and virus-virus interactions [21]. These techniques only capture pairwise relationships between time series (for example pathogen-pathogen or pathogen-environment) although in principal singular spectrum analysis can be extended to multiple time series [22]. Moreover these methods do not account for or adjust the data for potential confounders. Another recent approach is to use mechanistic stochastic models to estimate time varying parameters (e.g. a transmission rate) and then employ wavelet analysis to compare with potential weather or climatic drivers [11], but again in a pairwise manner.",

In this paper, we construct a framework for time series data analysis that allows the estimation of covariances among temporal disease datasets. Because the approach accounts for confounding variables and sources of non-stationarity such as seasonally varying infection risk, the resulting statistical framework now enables the joint estimation of pathogen dependencies on the temporal dimension whilst, crucially, distinguishing genuine pathogen-pathogen interactions from simple correlations.",

Whilst standard multivariate disease mapping frameworks investigate the joint spatial distribution of multiple diseases coinfecting a population simultaneously, our method instead analyses the joint temporal distribution of multiple infections. Because multivariate disease mapping naturally incorporates a between-disease covariance matrix, these methods conveniently lend themselves to the inference of temporal signatures of pathogen-pathogen interactions when adapted to analyse temporal dependencies. Importantly, because our method accounts for confounding variables as well as the autocorrelation structure, the method distinguishes genuine pathogen-pathogen interactions from simple correlations.",

Although observational data [39\u201342] and univariate response regression models [41, 43\u201345] indicate the potential for interactions among these common pathogens, limited evidence exists of their impact on epidemiological infection dynamics. Under the autoregressive structure, which provided a better fit to these data, our analysis provides robust evidence of a positive covariance between RSV and MPV and a negative covariance between IBV and AdV.

Sampling date, patient age, patient gender and sample origin (hospital or general practice submission that we used as a proxy for infection severity) were recorded.
