            "text": "Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) can damage healthy bystander tissues, thereby contributing to several inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases [1]. Neutrophil is the main ROS producing phagocyte which play an essential role in host defence against microbial pathogens and in inflammation. In response to stimulating agents such as the bacterial peptide N-formyl-methionyl-leucylphenyl-alanine (fMLF), neutrophils release large amounts of superoxide anion (O2\n.-) and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), used by myeloperoxidase (MPO) to produce hypochloric acid, in a phenomenon called the respiratory burst [2]. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase or NOX2, the enzyme responsible for superoxide anion production by phagocytes, is a multicomponent enzyme system consisting of membrane associated cytochrome b558 (composed of gp91phox and p22phox) and the cytosolic components p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and rac1/2 (a small GTPase) [3, 4]. Neutrophil activation leads to phosphorylation of the cytosolic components such as p47phox, a protein which plays an important role in the assembly and activation of NADPH oxidase.",

            "text": "Activated neutrophils and several associated products such as ROS, myeloperoxidase (MPO), elastase and inflammatory adipokines have been found in synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid polyarthritis [5, 6]. Neutrophils are highly mobile cells which are densely packed with secretory granules. Degranulation, a mechanism independent of ROS production, can also be incriminated as being a main cause of pulmonary disorders such as severe asphyxic episodes of asthma [7]. The dual role of neutrophils has been further highlighted during respiratory viral infection whereby it contributed to beneficial antiviral responses as well as detrimental tissue pathology and cellular inflammation [8]. Thus, the inhibition of excessive oxidant production and degranulation represent an important therapeutic target and could in part explain the beneficial effects of certain natural products used against inflammatory disorders. To this end, bioactive products isolated from medicinal plant such as Garcinia buchananii and Ficus aurantiaca Griff have been shown to be antioxidative by respectively displaying in vitro H2O2 scavenging activity [9] or inhibiting neutrophil ROS production [10]. Indeed, integration of the wealthy African medication for several diseases including inflammation in western medicine is considered as a promising challenge [11]. Medicinal plant extracts are usually made with water and water-soluble polysaccharides isolated from plants have attracted much attention because of their broad spectrum of therapeutic properties and relative low toxicity [12].",

A standardized water-soluble polysaccharide extract was prepared as described previously [18]. Briefly, 170 g of Anv powder, corresponding to the plant aerial part, was suspended in distilled water (1 g/20 mL) and stirred for 3 h at 100 \u00b0C before cooling overnight at 8 \u00b0C. The supernatant obtained by centrifugation for 30 min at 4000 g was reduced to half volume by evaporation. Polysaccharides were precipitated from the filtrates by the adding four volumes of ethanol (95 %). The precipitates (16.48 g = 9.7 %) were collected by centrifugation for 30 min at 15,000 g and washed with ethanol and dried. The sample was dissolved in distilled water (1 g/50 mL), dialysed against distilled water for 72 h at 4 \u00b0C. The dialysis residue was treated with tri-chloro-acetic acid and sodium acetate to remove proteins. The crude polysaccharide mixtures were precipitated by ethanol and air dried. The percentage yield relative to dry samples weight was 3.18 % and the presence of proteins was not detected by colorimetric methods [19, 20]. Similarly, we also extracted water-soluble polysaccharides (2.48 % yield) from another identified traditional medicinal plant from the same region, Zygophyllum gaetulum Emb. & Maire (Zyg), [21]. It was collected and identified by by Dr. Ali Zitouni and deposited at the above herbarium with the voucher (No.A.g.2010-2).",

We also studied the established anti-inflammatory drug, aspirin [10] and fMLF or PMA was used to stimulate ROS production which was measured by using luminol-amplified chemiluminescence as shown in Additional file 1. Anv was a strong inhibitor of ROS production with a similar IC50 value (60 \u03bcg/mL) for either fMLF or PMA response while Zyg was poorly effective. The aspirin IC50 values were 200 \u03bcg/mL and 300 \u03bcg/mL for inhibiting fMLF or PMA response respectively. To gain further insight in the mechanism of Anv inhibition, we explore its effect on the production of superoxide anion, the first product of NADPH oxidase. We used the cytochrome c reduction assay which is a specific technique for measuring superoxide anion. As shown in (Fig. 1a) Anv dose-dependently inhibited O2\n.- production by human neutrophils stimulated with fMLF. Further, a dramatic inhibition of O2\n.- production was observed in response to PMA. We investigated if this inhibition was due to a scavenging of O2\n.- by Anv extract by using the in vitro xanthine oxidase production of O2\n.- . Results in (Fig. 1b), show that the production of O2\n.- was not significantly altered in the presence of increasing concentrations of Anv. Taken together, the results are in favour of an Anv effect on NADPH oxidase activity as opposed to a scavenging activity.\n",

We compared the effect of Anv with the water-soluble polysaccharide extract of Zyg which did not modulate O2\n.- production by human neutrophils in response to PMA, thus suggesting the involvement of different mechanisms and represented a potential control versus active Anv (data not shown). The results in (Fig. 2a, left panel) show that neither Anv nor Zyg was able to promote the translocation of p47phox to neutrophil plasma membrane in the resting state. When neutrophils were incubated with PMA, it stimulated a strong translocation of p47phox. This PMA-induced translocation was significantly inhibited in the presence of Anv and not Zyg as indicated by the histogram. Similar results were obtained with PKC\u03b2 showing that Anv was effective in inhibiting PKC\u03b2 translocation to plasma membrane in response to PMA (Fig. 2b). Further, activation of NADPH oxidase in neutrophils by PMA is known to be accompanied by a strong phosphorylation of Ser328 in the regulatory subunit, p47phox [24]. We detected little or no phosphorylation using a specific anti-phosphoSer328 antibody, in control samples (Fig. 2c), while PMA induced a strong Ser328 phosphorylation. Interestingly, Anv at the same concentration used above (300 \u03bcg/ml) significantly inhibited this phosphorylation of p47phox on Ser328 stimulated by PMA while Zyg was ineffective.\n",

Phagocytic cells such as neutrophils play a key role in innate immunity because of their ability to recognize, ingest and destroy pathogens by oxidative and nonoxidative mechanisms. However, neutrophil hyper-activation has been shown to induce tissue injury and inflammatory reactions [1, 8]. Thus, inhibition of neutrophil hyper activation represents an interesting strategy to develop novel anti-inflammatory agents. There is increasing research in identifying novel natural plant products to integrate in conventional immunomodulators as they often have less side effects [11, 12]. Our data showed that water-soluble polysaccharides extract isolated from medicinal plants, Anv inhibited fMLF- and PMA-induced superoxide anion (O2\n.-) production in human neutrophils. Anv inhibited PMA-induced PKC activation resulting in the inhibition of PMA-induced phosphorylation and translocation of the NADPH oxidase subunit p47phox. Also, the Anv extract inhibited MPO degranulation. These results suggest that polysaccharides isolated from Anv could exert a strong anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting neutrophil functions and by limiting reactive oxygen species (ROS) propagation to nearby tissues.",

The pronounced effect on PMA versus fMLF may be due to different mechanisms including O2\n.- scavenging since ROS-scavenging activity has been observed with some polysaccharide extracts [25, 26]. Polysaccharide isolated from Artemisa tripartite has been shown to scavenge both H2O2 and O2\n.- and their capacity to scavenge may be due to difference in polysaccharide composition and size [27]. The potent scavenging property of exogenous polysaccharides compounds represents a therapeutic potential for oxidative stress-associated inflammatory diseases. This has been recently highlighted in vivo by endogenous scavenging lectin such as Reg3 alpha which suppresses extracellular reactive oxygen species to protect from liver toxicity [28]. In our study, we found that O2\n.- was not scavenged by Anv polysaccharide using an in vitro assay whereby superoxide anion (O2\n.-) is produced by xanthine oxidase [27].",

Interestingly, it was shown that while water-insoluble chitosan derivatives can activate neutrophils by a phagocytosis mechanism, soluble ones would prime neutrophils and potentiate oxidative burst [29]. Thus, soluble polysaccharide extracts can have both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on neutrophil functions. In our study, it is unlikely that water-soluble polysaccharide extract of Anv directly inhibited the NOX2 enzyme since there was a preferential inhibition of O2\n.- production by NOX2 induced by two different stimulators, PMA or fMLF. Moreover, PMA represents not only a positive control but it is an appropriate tool to explore the signal transduction pathways involved in the activation of NOX2 and degranulation process of neutrophils [24, 31, 32]. PMA can directly activate the phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C, which translocate to the plasma membrane and by phospohorylating NADPH oxidase components such as p47phox participates in the assembly and activation of NOX2 [33]. All PKC isoforms present in human neutrophils, including PKC\u03b2 are known to activate NADPH oxidase [24]. The biological relevance of PKC pathway was sustained by the use of opsonised zymosan, components of yeast cell wall, which activated a PKC-dependent activation of NOX2 in neutrophils [34]. We found that Anv inhibited the membrane translocation of p47phox and PKC\u03b2 induced by PMA. Water-soluble polysaccharide extract of another North African medicinal plant Zyg, which is similarly used as Anv against inflammatory diseases, was also studied in order to explore their mechanisms. Further, Zyg is sometimes given together with Anv as traditional medicine. In contrast to Anv, we found that Zyg barely inhibited O2\n.- production by neutrophils in response to either PMA or fMLF (data not shown). In line with this observation, we found that Zyg was ineffective in modulating the membrane translocation of p47phox and PKC\u03b2 induced by PMA. The production of superoxide anions by NOX2 in human neutrophil is accompanied by extensive phosphorylation of p47phox which is an excellent substrate for PKC [24]. To further validate the action of Anv on PKC/ p47phox, we studied its effect on serine 328 of p47phox, which is one of the most phosphorylated serine residues by PKC. The results obtained by using our raised antibody against this phosphorylated residue showed that Anv polysaccharide was able to inhibit PMA-induced phosphorylation of serine 328 of p47phox as well as its translocation to neutrophil plasma membrane and Zyg extract was ineffective. Altogether, the results indicate a clear effect of water-soluble Anv polysaccharide extract on the modulation of PMA-induced superoxide anions.",

            "text": "The progression of inflammation is significantly affected by myeloperoxidase (MPO) released from azurophilic granules of neutrophils accumulated at inflammatory sites [35]. MPO-dependent oxidative system can damage host tissue through the generation of oxidants. There are some data suggesting that polysaccharides may influence the traffic of different granules in neutrophils and their degranulation in phagosomes or the extracellular environment. It has been recently shown that water soluble polysaccharides extracted from Bupleurum chinense inhibited fMLF-induced HL60 cell recruitment and involved the inhibition of rac-1 activation [36]. The traffic of cytosolic rac-1 or rac-2 to plasma membrane is crucial in the assembly of functional NADPH oxidase and may represent a site of inhibitory action for polysaccharide extracts. Moreover, rac-2 serves has a selective role in the degranulation of neutrophils, a process which is independent of ROS production [37]. Further, the anti-inflammatory aqueous extract of Punia granatum has been shown to selectively inhibit MPO activity of human neutrophils which depends on degranulation process [38]. In contrast, it has been shown that acidic polysaccharides isolated from the medicinal plant Tanacetum vulgare L. can enhance neutrophil MPO release [39]. Thus, it is important to test the effect of Anv on neutrophil degranulation initiated by fMLF or PMA. The effect on azurophilic or specific granules was estimated by following MPO and CD11b expression respectively. We could show that Anv extract was more effective in inhibiting fMLF- than PMA-induced MPO release in the extracellular medium. Also, the surface expression of CD11b, a sensitive marker of PMN activation by fMLF was inhibited by Anv. Our results indicate that Anv polysaccharide can inhibit both PMA and fMLF induced degranulation processes which involve a large group of intracellular signalling molecules [40].",
