There are >70 arboviruses in the genus Flavivirus including JEV, dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), and yellow fever virus [2]. JEV can cause severe central nervous disorders such as poliomyelitis-like paralysis, aseptic meningitis, and encephalitis in humans. The fatality rate caused by JEV is 10\u201350% and half of the survivors have severe neurological sequelae, including persistent motor defects and severe cognitive and language impairments [3]. The geographic range of JEV is still expanding with an enhanced threat, and JEV infections have been reported in Australia [4], [5], Pakistan [6], and Saipan [7] in the past 30 years. Therefore, JEV is still an important pathogen that has global health significance.",

            "text": "Inactivated and live-attenuated vaccines have been used for prevention of JEV infection for many years [8], [9]. Although vaccines have reduced the incidence of JE in some countries, they seem not to be effective against all the clinical isolates [10]. In August 2006, there was an outbreak of JEV in Shanxi Province, China, which caused 66 cases and 19 deaths [11]. There is an urgent need for antiviral agents that can reduce the death toll and neurological sequelae of JEV infection [12]. Two anti-hepatitis C virus drugs targeting viral protease, telaprevir VX-950 (developed by Vertex) and boceprevir SCH503034 (developed by Merck), won approval in 2011 [13]. Various effective inhibitors against DENV and WNV have also been identified as drug candidates [14], [15]. In recent studies, some agents were found to have good antiviral effects against JEV. Indirubin, derived from Isatis indigotica extract, was proved to have inhibitory effects on JEV in vitro with less cytotoxicity [16]. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) suppressed the replication and virus-induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells by acting on the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase [17]. N-nonyl-deoxynojirimycin affected the interaction between calnexin (endoplasmic reticulum chaperone) and JEV glycoproteins (premembrane, envelope, and non-structural protein 1), and thus had anti-JEV effects both in vitro and in vivo\n[18]. SCH 16, a derivative of N-methylisatin-\u03b2-thiosemicarbazone, inhibited 50% of the plaques produced by JEV at a concentration of 16 \u00b5g/mL (0.000025 \u00b5M) [19]. However, there are currently only a small number of JEV inhibitors available for drug development.",

It is effective for treatment of essential hypertension and has been approved in Japan [29]. The toxicity of cilnidipine is low (MLD50 >5 g/kg) and has a low incidence of unfavorable side effects in humans [30]. In the present study, cilnidipine also showed effective inhibition of JEV. The replication of JEV was almost completely inhibited by 20 or 15 \u00b5M cilnidipine. So, cilnidipine might be a candidate anti-JEV drug.",

In the present study, FGIN-1-27 showed ideal antiviral effects at concentrations of 5\u201320 \u00b5M. The high selectivity index (38.78) illustrated that FGIN-1-27 could inhibit JEV with high specificity. A previous study showed that FGIN-1-27 had the ability to enter the brain [32]. Therefore, FGIN-1-27 might inhibit JEV in brain cells, and could be a potential drug for treatment of encephalitis caused by JEV.",
