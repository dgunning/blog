The ability to synthesize lipids predisposes an organism to function as a host to parasites that have lost or lack this trait [1]. Viruses as obligate parasites rely exclusively on the host to fulfill their membrane and lipid requirements. This is especially true for enveloped viruses since they utilize host-derived lipid membranes to facilitate release from infected cells by budding as well as to enter cells through membrane fusion. Lipids also form an integral structural component of the virus particle.",

Both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses induce extensive ultrastructural changes in infected cells. Host-derived membranes are rearranged to provide extensive platforms that help to assemble arrays of replication factories [2]\u2013[6]. Some of these factories are housed in specialized membrane compartments that assist in evading host antiviral defense mechanisms [2]\u2013[4], [7]. These compartments also function to increase the local concentration of molecules necessary for efficient viral RNA replication and particle assembly. Recent advances in electron tomography techniques have been instrumental in providing a three-dimensional perspective of these virus-induced membranes [2]\u2013[4], [7]. However, the metabolic cost to the host or vector and the contribution of lipid biosynthesis and trafficking to the formation of these replication factories is yet in its early stages of investigation [8]\u2013[12].",

Currently 50\u2013100 million cases of dengue fever are estimated annually [14]. Since DENV replicates within the mosquito vector as well as the human host, the spread of the virus can be greatly reduced by controlling the vector. Much effort has been placed in understanding the dynamics of virus transmission and replication in the mosquito vector, including identification of host proteins in the midgut and salivary glands that are regulated by DENV infection [15]\u2013[17]. Less is known about the global impact of DENV on host metabolic pathways.",

This extensive requirement in both host and vector, for intracellular membranes that support viral RNA replication and assembly suggest that quantifiable changes may exist in the lipid repertoire of the infected cell to assist in the formation of these membranes. Identifying these lipid changes that occur during infection is a necessary first step to discovering how DENV and its constituent proteins modify the lipid metabolism of cells. The reason(s) for such modifications has yet to be described, but can be pursued with a knowledge of which lipid changes occur. Furthermore, novel therapeutics that modify or inhibit these lipid changes and lipid-protein interactions could conceivably result in inhibition of virus replication.",

We have identified several lipid classes that are regulated by DENV infection. Many of these lipids have characteristic roles in influencing membrane architecture as well as functioning in cellular signal transduction pathways. Specifically, we have identified differences induced in the lipid profile upon virus binding and entry alone compared to those induced by viral RNA replication, assembly and egress. We have also profiled the lipidome of cells treated with an inhibitor of de novo phospholipid biosynthesis. Through this we have identified a lipid environment that supports cell survival but is yet inhibitory to DENV replication.",

These lipids result primarily from the hydrolysis of PC by phospholipase A2-type enzymes (PLA2) and represent a PL that is missing an acyl chain [27]\u2013[30]. In DENV-infected cells, there was a preferential up regulation (\u223c3 fold) of these lipids compared to both UV-DENV and mock controls at the 36 hr time point. This expression was slightly down regulated at the 60 hr time point to about \u223c1.5 fold above the mock. In UV-DENV exposed cells, LPLs were undetectable at the 36 hr time point, while at the later time point, they were similar or slightly above the mock levels. As shown in figure 3H, LPLs with C16 acyl chains were up regulated at both time points while there was a selective up regulation of LPLs containing C18 acyl chains only at the early time point (Figure 3H). The C16 LPLs have been implicated in pro-apoptotic signaling pathways. This observation of selected LPL expression presents an attractive hypothesis that chain length differences may dictate specific roles for LPLs during virus infection.",

Essentially, we monitored the production of BODIPY-LPC (resulting from PLA2 mediated metabolism of PC) during a time course of DENV infection (Figure S1) (method from [31]). The assay indicated that following 24 hr of infection and longer, PLA2 activity was elevated in DENV-infected cells compared to the controls, with the highest activity occurring at 48 and 72 hr post-infection. Therefore, the elevated levels of PLA2 could be the source of the LPL detected in DENV-infected cells.",

In DENV infected cells, SM was up regulated by \u223c2-fold compared to the controls (UV-DENV and mock) and remained elevated at both 36 hr and 60 hr time points (Figure 3A and B). Furthermore, this temporal expression varied depending on the specific molecular species being expressed (Figure 3E and Table S1). UV-DENV exposed cells showed similar levels of SM compared to the mock at the 36 hr time point, but these levels decreased at the later time point. Interestingly, an analog of SM known as ceramide phosphoethanolamine (CER-PE), was preferentially expressed (up regulated by \u223c2 fold) in UV-DENV exposed cells at the 36 hr time point (compared to DENV and mock) (Figure 3G). However, this expression level dropped below the mock at the later time point. In comparison, DENV infected cells showed very low expression of this lipid at the early time point (\u223c0.7 fold compared to mock) and its expression was undetectable at the later time point (Figure 3A and B). This lipid is expressed more abundantly in insect cells rather than in mammalian cells [23]\u2013[24].",

Since SM was also up regulated similarly in DENV infected cells, the rise in CER is possibly the result of de novo synthesis rather than SM degradation. UV-DENV-exposed cells showed undetectable CER levels at 36 hr, while at 60 hr the expression was (\u223c2 fold) above the mock control. Since there was a concurrent decrease in SM in UV-DENV exposed cells at 60 hr, the increased levels of CER in this case could be due to the degradation of SM resulting from increased cellular stress (resulting from incubation of the cells for 60 hr). Similar to other lipid species, CER also showed temporal regulation depending on the molecular species expressed (Figure 3F).",

Since C75 disrupts the formation of lipids down stream of FAS, several fatty acids (stearic and palmitic acid) were down regulated in the drug treated cells. An enrichment of these fatty acids was observed in the untreated cells upon comparison with C75 treated cells (Figure 7C). In contrast, as observed in the previous comparison of DENV infected cells to uninfected cells (Figure 5), oleic acid was down-regulated in untreated DENV infected cells and therefore, showed enrichment in C75 treated cells.

Enrichment of these lipids was observed in untreated DENV infected cells compared to C75 treated cells (Figure 7D). In addition to the phospholipids, de novo synthesis of sphingolipids was also disrupted by C75. Key intermediates in this pathway such as N-palmitoylesphingosine and N-stearoylesphingosine were down regulated upon treatment of cells with C75 and up regulated in untreated DENV infected cells (Figure 7A and Table S3).",

Consistent with these observations, several primary fatty acids (palmitic, stearic and oleic acid) involved in the biosynthesis of higher order PLs were detected in our lipidomic analyses. Palmitic acid is the first fatty acid of the lipogenesis pathway and stearic acid (C18:0), is immediately downstream of palmitic acid. They are both up regulated in DENV infected cells. The latter is the precursor to the biosynthesis of oleic acid (C18:1) or long chain fatty acids (with acyl chains of C20 or greater). Interestingly, since oleic acid is down regulated in DENV-infected cells stearic acid may be stimulating long chain FA biosynthesis. However, a majority of the PLs expressed in DENV infected cells have C16- or C18-acyl chains with varying degrees of unsaturation. Therefore, it seems that desaturation of palmitic and stearic acid rather than elongation may be the chosen pathway for lipogenesis during DENV infection.",

To circumvent this inhibition, the cell redistributes its lipid repertoire to ensure cell survival. However, this redistribution does not support DENV replication. A comparison of the different lipid environments indicated that many of the lipids that were up regulated in DENV infected cells compared to cells treated with C75, were similar to those previously observed when infected cells were compared to mock (uninfected) controls.

Analysis of the lipidome of UV-DENV exposed cells showed a significant difference in the phospholipid and sphingolipid content in comparison to DENV infected cells and the mock control. It is possible that binding, membrane fusion and entry alone, or the expression of viral proteins from the incoming viral RNA triggers the activation of lipases or lipid transport mechanisms that result in the differences observed in the lipidome of the cells. This has been shown for other viruses. Jan et al. have shown that binding and entry alone of Sindbis virus triggered the activation of sphingomyelinases that degraded membrane bound SM to Cer [52].

A comparison of SM and CER in the whole cell analysis at the 36 hr and 60 hr time points (Figure 1A and 1B) indicated a reduction in SM with a corresponding increase in CER with time. This could be due to a similar scenario to SINV where a non-replicating UV-DENV is capable of inducing lipid conversion in membranes [52]. Therefore, SM and other sphingolipids may be converted to CER that is transported away from the 16K membrane fraction to other locations in the cell. This is also evident from the increased content of fatty acids compared to mock cells that may result from the degradation of lipids. UV-DENV exposed cells do not show significant regulation of MG or DG, but show an up regulation of palmitic acid (C16:0). Virus binding and entry alone could stimulate lipid droplet hydrolysis (catabolism of TG) resulting in the release of palmitic acid.

Several of the identified molecules also function as bioactive messengers that control signaling and membrane trafficking pathways in the cells. They represent molecules that result from the activation of cellular stress pathways that respond to viral infections. Based on these findings, the next steps will be to investigate the mechanisms of how these lipid species play a role in DENV replication, as well as identify the control points in these pathways that may be influenced by viral gene products.",

The data were next examined in a 2-D fashion using MultiAlign to identify groups of mass spectral peaks that were observed in sequential spectra using an algorithm [57] that computes a Euclidean distance in n-dimensional space for combinations of peaks. Each group, generally ascribed to one detected species and referred to as a \u201cfeature\u201d, has a median monoisotopic mass, central normalized elution time (NET), and abundance estimate computed by summing the intensities of the MS peaks that comprise the entire LC-MS feature. LC-MS features were then chromatographically aligned across all datasets using the LCMSWARP algorithm [58] in MultiAlign, and the lipid identities of detected features were initially determined by comparing their measured monoisotopic masses and NETs to calculated monoisotopic masses and observed NETs for lipids in an AMT tag database [59] within search tolerances of \u00b13 ppm and \u00b10.03 NET for monoisotopic mass and elution time, respectively.

At 12 hr post-infection, the label containing supernatant was removed and new medium was added to the cells. At 36 and 60 hr post-infection, cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed with buffer A (35 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 146 mM NaCl, 11 mM glucose). Cells were then osmotically shocked in buffer B (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgOAc and 1 mM DTT) for 30 min on ice, homogenized and centrifuged at 1500\u00d7 g, at 4\u00b0C for 5 min to remove nuclei. Post-nuclear supernatants were centrifuged at 16000\u00d7 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C to obtain a membrane pellet (referred to as the 16K pellet). The supernatant post nuclear and membrane fractionation is referred to as the cytoplasmic extract (CE). Total RNA was extracted from each fraction (16K and CE) using Trizol reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following RNA extraction, total lipids were extracted using the Bligh and Dyer method mentioned above and counted using a Beckman LS 6000 scintillation counter. The viral RNA in each fraction was measured using the SuperScript III Platinum SYBR Green One-Step qPCR Kit with ROX and DENV specific primers; (forward) 5\u2032 ACAAGTCGAACAACCTGGTCCAT 3\u2032 and (reverse) 5\u2032 GCCGCACCATTGGTCTTCTC 3\u2032 on a Applied Biosystems 7300 Real Time PCR machine.

The grey dashed line highlights specific pathways of interest. Black arrows highlight reactions suggested by the lipidomic data and grey arrows represent reactions not observed in the data. Metabolites highlighted in boxes (solid line) are up regulated (white) or down regulated (grey) in DENV infected mosquito cells. 1. Through the recruitment and activation of FAS, DENV stimulates de novo phospholipid biosynthesis in the replication complex [20]. 2. Inhibition of this process with C75 disrupts the cellular lipid repertoire in mosquito cells to be unfavorable for virus replication. 3. The lipidomic analyses reveal an up regulation of fatty acids such as palmitic (C16) and stearic (C18) acid. These fatty acids are intermediates in the biosynthesis of phospholipids, which is up regulated during DENV infection. Interestingly, in DENV infected cells the prevalent phospholipids primarily consist of C16 and C18 unsaturated acyl chains. Very long chain fatty acids are not significantly up regulated during infection. 4. FAS activity also stimulates de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis. In the lipidomic analyses, the up regulation of intermediates such as N-palmitoylesphingosine suggests sphingolipid biosynthesis is activated during DENV infection. Specifically, SM and CER are enriched in DENV infected cells. Alternately, the up regulation in CER (and DG) during infection could result from the degradation of SM through the activity of sphingomyelinases (Smase). The resulting CER and DG could be redirected into several signaling pathways or be utilized for de novo phospholipid biosynthesis. The glycopshingolipids, GlcCER and GalCER are down regulated during DENV infection, which suggest that they are catabolized to produce CER. 5. Lipidomic analyses also suggest the up regulation of triacylglycerol catabolism (Lipolysis) in DENV infected cells. This pathway results in the generation of MG, DG and palmitic acid. These intermediates are all up regulated in DENV infected cells and could be utilized for downstream signaling or de novo phospholipid biosynthesis. It has also been shown that TG catabolism is necessary for mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation during DENV infection [50]. 6. Elevated levels of LPC in DENV infected cells also suggest activation of PC hydrolysis by PLA2. This enzyme is activated during DENV infection. The elevated levels of other phospholipids such as PA, PI, PE, PG as well as PC suggest that the CDG-DG pathway for phospholipid biosynthesis could also be activated.
