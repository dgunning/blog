PRRSV is a small, enveloped, positive-strand RNA viral pathogen that encodes a polycistronic RNA genome consisting of a 15-kb long 3'-polyadenylation molecule that is responsible for detrimental reproductive disturbance, post-weaning pneumonia, growth disorders, low physiological performance, and a notable death rate in the swine industry. The first outbreaks of PRRSV were reported in Germany in 1990 and were far-flung throughout Europe by 1991 [2]. The outbreak of PRRSV in China in 2006 received global attention [3]. To date, PPRSV continues to spread and cause severe economic losses in the porcine industry worldwide.",

Dramatic membrane rearrangements, which support viral replication and assembly, often occur in host cells upon virus invasion [4]. Widespread virus-induced membrane remodelling is the most prominent morphological feature observed in images of PRRSV-infected cells. This phenomenon was described more than 20 years ago, and the shapes, properties and formation mechanisms of these replicative structures have been characterized [5]. It has been shown that PRRSV mRNA is translated into a single polyprotein associated with certain organelles, such as mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and these structures are morphologically similar to autophagosomes [6, 7]. Synchronously, the polyprotein is cleaved by cellular and viral proteases, which produce individual proteins required for later viral RNA synthesis and virion assembly. Furthermore, several studies have identified extensive cytoskeletal alterations induced by various members of the order Nidovirales. For instance, microtubule networks and double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) are reorganized in cells infected with EAV, and the innate immune system interfaces with the formation of replication organelles [8\u201312].",

            "text": "Some positive-strand RNA (+RNA) viruses induce membranous vesicles (MVs) to assemble virus replication complexes (RC) in infected cells. To a certain extent, viral RNA synthesis and the formation of replication-transcription complexes (RTCs) benefit from induced MVs. It is believed that viral proteins, RNA and some factors from the host cell create a scaffold for RCs, favouring viral RNA synthesis [12]. Additionally, membranes induced by the virus assist viral RNA, especially double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), with escaping the host immune response to replicate [13]. Different viruses form their RCs on specific cellular organelles, such as the outer mitochondrial membrane, the ER [14\u201316], the Golgi complex [16, 17] or the plasma membrane [15, 18]. Benefitting from electron microscopy (EM) and electron tomography (ET) technology, many studies have described the membrane rearrangements induced by positive-strand RNA viruses, including nodavirus (flock house virus), flaviviruses (dengue, West Nile and hepatitis C virus) and togavirus (rubella virus). Of note, in studies of other members of Nidovirales, the replication of EAV and three coronaviruses, specifically mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) [19], severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) [20] and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), induced membrane rearrangement, including DMVs and reticular inclusions or complex membranes [20, 21]. DMVs were also observed during infection with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), another coronavirus, and a small proportion of these DMVs were connected to the ER through their outer membrane, forming a zipped ER region [22].",

In addition, nidoviruses such as corona- and arteriviruses induce reticulovesicular networks (RVNs) of interconnected ER-derived DMVs and other membrane rearrangements. The RVN is thought to provide a location for viral replication or assembly and to protect the RC from innate immune detection [8]. However, in PRRSV-infected cells, the three-dimensional architecture of the membrane network, its occurrence, and the site of RNA replication have not yet been elucidated. A study was conducted in the 1990s to describe host cell modifications during PRRSV replication, but no other in-depth research has been conducted to identify the particular role of PRRSV virions in cell membrane rearrangement [5]. Here, we elucidated viral RNA, protein synthesis and particle release sites and described the details of PRRSV-induced membrane rearrangement. Finally, we identified potential sites for the synthesis of viral RNA that may be released.",

Viral titres were measured to quantify infectious, cell-interacting viruses. Released progeny virus particles were observed at 12 h, which demonstrated that there was a 4-h delay in virus synthesis relative to RNA replication (Fig 1B). The nucleocapsid structural protein is dispensable for genome replication and subgenomic mRNA transcription [27]. Immunostaining results also showed that the concentration of viral N protein increased until 24 h.p.i. and then reached a plateau (Fig 1C). Virus titres and RNA levels peaked at 24 h.p.i., at which point synthesis of the viral N protein continued. Thus, the 24-h time point was the most appropriate time point for EM analysis to study the functional relationship between PRRSV-induced structures and RNA replication and identify PRRSV virus budding and membrane rearrangement.",

PRRSV is a positive-strand RNA virus that generates negative-strand RNA during propagation and transcription, and this negative-strand RNA is employed as a template for the assembly of positive-strand RNA. This process produces dsRNA intermediates, and dsRNA detection in virus-infected cells reflects viral replication. Cells contain many organelles; the ER is the main site involved in protein synthesis, and the autophagosome is involved in the phagocytic cell\u2019s own metabolism and invading molecules or viruses. Mitochondrial metabolism provides energy for cells, and lysosomes are responsible for the decomposition of certain types of metabolized organic matter. In mock-infected cells, low amounts of dsRNA or N protein were immunolabeled (S1 Fig). At 24 h.p.i., Marc-145 cells infected with PRRSV were fixed, and PRRSV dsRNA, N protein and cellular proteins were detected using mono-specific antibodies, antibodies (calnexin, LC3) and organelle markers (MitoTracker, LysoTracker), respectively. To better explain the colocalization of two markers, we quantified the overlap coefficient using Pearson\u2019s correlation, and values above 0.5 indicated colocalization. PRRSV dsRNA and N protein were mainly located outside of the nucleus and colocalized with calnexin or LC3 (Fig 4A, 4B, 4E, 4F and 4I), with Pearson\u2019s correlation values of 0.65\u00b10.10, 0.60\u00b10.11, 0.75\u00b10.09 and 0.68\u00b10.08, respectively. Additionally, colocalization was detected between N protein and MitoTracker RED, which is a marker of mitochondria (Fig 4H and 4I), with a Pearson\u2019s correlation value of 0.56\u00b10.10; however, PRRSV dsRNA and MitoTracker RED demonstrated little evidence of colocalization (0.19\u00b10.07) (Fig 4D and 4I). Neither PRRSV protein N nor dsRNA colocalized with lysosomes stained with LysoTracker (0.17\u00b10.08 and 0.17\u00b10.10) (Fig 4C, 4G and 4I).

PRRSV-induced vesicles were apparent, and immunogold labelling revealed vesicles containing the N protein of PRRSV (Fig 5C and 5C\u2019). Some N protein was also associated with mitochondria (Fig 5D and 5D\u2019). In addition, we observed gold particles in the cytoplasm.

The association of DMVs with the ER through their outer membranes suggested that these interactions may depict the intermediate stages of DMV formation, before DMVs are isolated from the ER.

We comprehensively monitored membrane rearrangements and viral replication every 4 h from 0 to 16 h.p.i. and every 12 h after 24 h.p.i. DMVs appeared at 16 h.p.i. and became larger at 24 h.p.i.; during this period, levels of newly synthesized viral RNA began to increase. These results imply a link between membrane remodelling and RNA synthesis. However, at 36 h.p.i., the size and number of DMVs were not significantly different, and large numbers of vacuolar structures appeared (Fig 3). We inferred that the decreased viral RNA synthesis rate we observed was mainly attributable to increased viral genome packaging in the cytoplasm, resulting in an increased rate of viral particle release, thus preventing RNA accumulation. This may be induced by the consumption of RNA produced by the cells.",

Although the role of vesicles as RNA replication sites has been established, the hypothesis stating that PRRSV RNA synthesis occurs in the vesicle lumen requires further exploration through staining for dsRNA markers. The formation of RTCs is induced by positive-strand RNA viruses during infection; these RTCs contain viral proteins, host proteins, viral nucleic acids, and the host ER membrane and dsRNA formed during virus replication. Autophagy has been shown to be crucial for the replication of several positive-strand RNA viruses, such as poliovirus [34], coronavirus [35] and dengue virus [36]. Using immunofluorescence and IEM, we found that dsRNA synthesized by the virus localized on the ER and autophagosomes near the nucleus, indicating that the ER and autophagosomes are essential for viral replication (Figs 4 and 5). In our study, the PRRSV N protein co-localized with mitochondria, suggesting that, unlike previous reports of mitophagy [6], the viral capsid protein was attached to the internal network. Morphological changes in the mitochondrial membrane compared with uninfected cells have not yet been detected.",

Many positive-strand RNA virus-induced structures are composed of DMVs [30]. West Nile virus stimulates retraction of the ER membrane, which links to the cytosol via small pores, modulating the release of viral RNA [14]. Relevant findings were confirmed with dengue virus, another flavivirus. Polioviruses demonstrate extensive membrane recombination derived from sections of an anterograde membrane trafficking system to produce single-membrane vesicles and DMVs and form complex network structures [16]. Data from other studies have shown that the propagation of positive-stranded RNA viruses is connected to intracellular membranes; virus-induced membrane alterations are connected with viral RNA replication, including genome replication, and involve changes in the mitochondria and Golgi [9\u201311, 38]. Plant pathogens such as BBSV induce widespread rearrangement of the ER to form dotted spots or plaques in the cytoplasm, and tomato bushy stunt virus induces more peroxisomal and chloroplast remodelling [39]. In our research, PRRSV infection produced large numbers of vesicles, most of which were connected with the ER membrane structure and part of the constructed RVNs (Fig 6). Notably, DMVs contained a channel linking their exterior to the ER. The diameter of this channel, which connected PRRSV-induced vesicles with the cytoplasm, must be sufficiently large for the exchange of RNA products and nucleotides with cytoplasm. This result is consistent with our hypothesis that this channel provides the required components for viral RNA synthesis sites. Our results suggest that the pattern of cellular pathology produced by PRRSV infection is similar to those of HCV and SARS-CoV and results in large numbers of complex structures that affect the reorganization of cellular membrane structures.",

The core was described as a double-layered hollow structure with an average diameter of 39 nm. ET was first used to demonstrate the 3D resolution of the FHV replication complex [42]. This technique has since been applied to characterize the 3D characteristics of a variety of positive-strand RNA viruses, including Picornaviridae viruses, Flaviviridae viruses, hepatitis C virus and Coronaviridae viruses [10, 43]. In this study, ET captured viral particles budding from the ER membrane (Fig 7). Viral particles are synthesized in vesicles derived from the ER and are secreted into the cytoplasm to exert their viral activities [19]. These structures have previously been detected exclusively in flavivirus [31] and coronavirus-infected cells.

However, we identified some differences between membrane structures caused by PRRSV infection and other related viruses as well as novel membrane structures. These membrane structures are similar to the RNA synthesis sites confirmed for other positive single-stranded RNA viruses. More importantly, for the first time, we used ET to reconstitute nidovirus particle synthesis sites. Further research should investigate whether vesicles provide sites for PRRSV RNA synthesis and determine which viral proteins induce membrane rearrangement. To our knowledge, this study is the first to present the PRRSV-induced membrane changes associated with viral RNA replication in 3D models.",
