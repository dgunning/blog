            "text": "The first line of defense against RSV infection consists of epithelial cells. Upon infection, epithelial cells attract antigen-presenting cells, including dendritic cells and monocytes. Monocytes and macrophages are able to engulf pathogens leading to antigen-presentation. The monocytic cell is one of the major immune cell types that is susceptible to RSV infection and the role of monocytes and macrophages in the pathogenesis of RSV infections has been appreciated for decades [2\u20137]. During RSV infection in mice, the recruitment of monocytes from the bloodstream limits viral replication and reduces disease severity [8]. Viral particles can interact with receptors at the membrane of monocytes resulting in attachment, uptake and initiation of the immune response [9\u201311]. Under many circumstances, actin or clathrin are essential for receptor-mediated internalization [12\u201316]. Internalization can be regulated differentially dependent on the cell type. Uptake of transferrin occurs clathrin-dependent in macrophages and is not dependent on clathrin in epithelial cells [17]. Cell-specific differences in entry mechanisms between epithelial cells and fibroblasts have been shown for human cytomegalovirus [18]. Previous studies have studied the internalization of RSV in epithelial cells [19\u201322]. No data is available regarding cell entry of RSV in monocytes, which raises the question whether internalization of RSV occurs differentially in innate immune cells. After internalization, immune cells are involved in antigen-presentation, T cell activation and the production of cytokines like interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3). IFN-\u03b3, a type II interferon, plays a critical role in the immune response against viral infections [23]. T cell activation may occur through cytokines like interleukin 18 (IL-18) or through stimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR). The relationship between cell entry, T cell activation and subsequent release of IFN-\u03b3 during RSV infection in primary human cells is unknown. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) provide a useful model to investigate the impact of cellular pathways on antiviral immunity. PBMCs contain important cells that reflect the immune response against RSV like dendritic cells, monocytes and T cells [4, 24\u201327]. In this study, we aimed to investigate the regulation of IFN-\u03b3 by actin- and clathrin-dependent mechanisms after stimulation of human immune cells with RSV. For this, we used pharmacological inhibitors to inhibit actin and clathrin. Hereby, the contribution of actin- and clathrin-dependent processes on cell entry, T cell activation and induction of IFN-\u03b3 in primary human immune cells during RSV infection was studied.",

Cytochalasin D (CytoD) and Wiskostatin (Wisko) have been used in previous literature to inhibit actin-dependent entry and chlorpromazine (CPZ) for clathrin-dependent entry [28\u201330]. A representative figure of the gating strategy to determine internalization of RSV into monocytes is shown (Fig. 1a). Disruption of actin filaments in monocytes with CytoD or Wisko significantly reduces the internalization of RSV whereas inhibition of clathrin with CPZ has no effect on the internalization indicating that cell entry is an actin-dependent process (Fig. 1b). Extracellular binding of RSV on membrane of monocytes occurred and is not reduced by pre-treatment of monocytes with CytoD or CPZ (Fig. 1c). To confirm the inhibitory effect of CytoD on cell entry, PBMCs were stimulated with RSV for 24 h and virus gene transcription was measured in monocytes. Treatment of PBMCs with CytoD abrogates virus gene transcription in monocytes whereas CPZ has no effect (Fig. 1d). Mean percentages of internalization, binding and virus gene transcription in untreated monocytes were respectively 29 %, 13 % and 4 %.",

To determine whether the adaptive immune response against RSV is actin-dependent, the IFN-\u03b3 release was measured after stimulation of PBMCs with RSV. Inhibition of actin with CytoD abrogates the RSV-induced IFN-\u03b3 release (Fig. 2a). Although CPZ has no effect on the internalization of RSV, inhibition of clathrin reduces the release of IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 2b). Both CytoD and CPZ have no effect on T cell activation after stimulation with the non-specific T cell activator phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) (Fig. 2a\u2013b). From this, we conclude that both cell entry and post-endocytic processes play a role in the adaptive immune response against RSV whereas mere binding of RSV to the cell membrane of monocytes is not sufficient to induce IFN-\u03b3 release.",

RSV induces activation of CD4 and CD8 T cells and pre-treatment of PBMCs with CPZ prevents T cell activation after RSV infection (Fig. 3a\u2013b). To investigate whether the upregulation of antigen-presenting molecules is inhibited by CPZ, the expression levels of MHC-I and MHC-II on monocytes was determined. RSV induces a significant increase of MHC-I and MHC-II expression on monocytes (Fig. 3c\u2013d). Upregulation of MHC-I expression is not affected by treatment of PBMCs with CPZ (Fig. 3c).

            "text": "Actin is required for cell entry of RSV in epithelial cells [19]. We have shown for the first time, that primary human monocytes also require actin to internalize RSV for subsequent virus gene transcription to occur. Actin plays an essential role in processes involving internalization, including receptor-mediated phagocytosis. For the Nipah virus, a paramyxovirus like RSV, infection induces the co-internalization of Nipah virus receptor ephrinB2 and, in general, many receptors are internalized in an actin-dependent manner [33\u201335]. Several receptors are involved in the recognition of RSV at the membrane, like Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), CD14 and nucleolin [9, 36]. Internalization of TLR4 and CD14 has been investigated upon bacterial ligand stimulation. In this process, internalization of TLR4 is dynamin-dependent and CD14 is actin-dependent [37, 38]. Clustering of nucleolin is dependent on actin [39]. Whether actin-dependent clustering of nucleolin occurs after RSV infection and whether it is necessary for internalization is unknown. Our finding that intact actin filaments are required for internalization of RSV in monocytes narrows the scope of potential receptors that co-occur with cell entry and are required for internalization. Besides cell entry, intact actin is required for virus filament formation, viral transmission and the production of cell-associated infectious virus by epithelial cells [40\u201343]. We observed an inhibitory effect of CytoD on the release of IFN-\u03b3 during an incubation period of 24 h. Inhibition of post-endocytic processes like virus filament formation and transmission could therefore explain the observed reduction of IFN-\u03b3 after treatment with CytoD. However, in our model of PBMCs, monocytes exhibit abortive infection as no replicating virus is detected in the supernatant of PBMCs stimulated with RSV (data not shown). This is in line with the abortive infection of RSV in alveolar macrophages [44]. Therefore, the role of actin on virus filament formation and viral transmission may be applicable to epithelial cells but most likely would not play a role in our model.",

Permeabilization of the cells in our assay will not exclude extracellular staining of RSV F protein and therefore the remaining RSV-positive monocytes after treatment could reflect extracellular binding of RSV. Because CytoD does not influence the extracellular binding of RSV, we conclude that actin dynamics are involved in the internalization of RSV by monocytes. Actin-independent processes could also explain the incomplete prevention of internalization by CytoD. Fusion of the F protein of RSV with the cell membrane could result in entry of viral proteins and might act independently of actin filaments. Clathrin has previously been implicated for internalization of RSV in an epithelial cell line after an incubation period of 20 h [20]. Contrary, others have shown that internalization of RSV after 1 h is not clathrin-dependent [19]. The authors conclude that discrepancies between these studies may arise due to a difference in experimental design. The incubation period of 1 h in our study excludes inhibition of post-endocytic processes like viral replication and cell-to-cell transmission. In addition, differences between epithelial cells and monocytic cells have been described previously for internalization of nanoparticles and may explain our results compared to epithelial cells [17]. The role of cellular mechanisms on T cell activation can be studied in our model of PBMCs. Besides internalization, inhibition of actin dynamics reduces the IFN-\u03b3 response. These data suggest that, at least in part, the intracellular compartment is involved in the induction of an adaptive response and binding of RSV to the outer membrane is not sufficient to induce IFN-\u03b3 release. These results are in line with previous data indicating that intact RSV particles are not able to signal via membrane-associated receptors such as TLR4 [45].",

CPZ at 5 \u03bcg/ml was the highest tolerable concentration without inducing cytoxicity (data not shown). Our data suggest that activation of T cells by RSV is clathrin-dependent. Calabia-Linares et al. observed the importance of clathrin in the formation of the immunological synapse between T cell and antigen-presenting cells [46]. Possibly, inhibition of clathrin reduces the IFN-\u03b3 release due to improper formation of the immunological synapse and thereby inefficient T cell activation. Less than 1 % of the T cells in the peripheral blood are RSV-specific T cells [47, 48]. Therefore, the relative high percentage of 5-10 % CD69+ T cells after stimulation with RSV in our experiments most likely indicates that a general activation of T cells occurs. We demonstrate that clathrin plays an essential role in the upregulation of RSV-induced MHC-II expression on monocytes . The requirement of clathrin for MHC-II trafficking has been observed previously [49]. The role of MHC-II in the induction of IFN-\u03b3 is strengthened by the observation that inhibition of TCR signaling, as a ligand for MHC-II, reduces the IFN-\u03b3 response, whereas inhibition of IL-18 has no effect. The combination of reduced T cell activation and MHC-II expression suggests that clathrin plays a role in the interplay between innate and adaptive immunity against RSV.",
