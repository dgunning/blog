Even in a single species, the expressed molecules are dependent on cell types. This is the case with virus entry factors, which are cellular components involved in viral attachment to cells and invasion into cells for viral replication1,2. Thus, viral infections show specificity with regards to host ranges, tissues, and cell types, indicating that the identification of virus entry factors is useful for the molecular explanation of viral tropisms3. Because target tissues or cell types of viruses are strongly associated with virus-induced diseases, the identification of virus entry factors often leads to a more profound understanding of the associated diseases. Furthermore, the identification of viral entry factors might aid the efficient development of countermeasures against the induced diseases4,5.",

            "text": "Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a recently recognised tick-borne infectious disease with a high case fatality rate of up to 30%. SFTS virus, whose species name is Huaiyangshan banyangvirus (see below for details), is the causative agent6,7. There are no specific countermeasures against the disease. In SFTS patients, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia are frequently observed and viral antigens are often detected in the lymphoid organs in fatal cases8\u201311. In vitro, most lymphoid cell lines (e.g., Jurkat and Raji cells, which originate from T and B cells, respectively) show little susceptibility to SFTS virus infection. In contrast, most non-lymphoid cell lines (e.g., Vero cells, which originate from the kidney epithelium) show high susceptibility to the viral infection8,12\u201314. Calcium-dependent (C-type) lectins have been shown to enhance SFTS virus infection when expressed in cells that otherwise show little susceptibility13,14; however, this cannot fully explain the viral tropisms because most non-lymphoid cell lines do not generally express them. Nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIA (NMMHC-IIA) has been reported as a key entry factor of SFTS virus15; however, the molecule is expressed even in Jurkat cells and direct interaction with SFTS virus has not been demonstrated. Recent studies reported important roles of glucosylceramide and sorting nexin 11 (SNX11) in the intracellular trafficking and/or penetrating process of SFTS virus infection16,17; neither of their expression is cell type-specific and therefore can explain SFTS virus tropisms. These findings indicate that yet unidentified molecules or factors for virus entry contribute to SFTS viral tropism as well as the pathogenesis of SFTS, rather than C-type lectins, NMMHC-IIA, glucosylceramide, and SNX11.",

            "text": "The identification of virus entry factors has been performed by various methods, which are roughly classified into three categories: (I) speculation based on knowledge obtained from experiments18\u201321; (II) screening of libraries based on gain-of-function or loss-of-function criteria22\u201324; and (III) identification of interactive cellular molecules by peptide sequencing or mass spectrometry25\u201327. We have developed an efficient, low-cost cellular cDNA library screening method using a classical panning to identify virus entry factors (hereafter referred to as 1st generation panning for virus entry factor identification or simply 1st generation panning)28\u201330, which could be classified into category II. In 1st generation panning, cellular cDNA libraries are stably expressed in non-adherent cell lines by using a retroviral vector, which integrates genes into cellular genomes with no or low cytotoxicity and do not inhibit cell growth, and screened based on colony formation of target cells on viral particle-coated dishes. From genome of colony-forming cells, cDNAs encoding molecules which confer adhesiveness onto viral particles to non-adherent cells are recovered by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers targeting retroviral vector sequences flanking to cDNA library. Therefore, interaction between viral particles and surface molecules of target cells that is strong enough to trap target cells onto viral particle-coated dishes is a prerequisite for the method. The method was also applied to identify a receptor of a protozoa Plasmodium falciparum31. For viruses for which the interaction with target cells is not strong, we have developed another efficient screening method to identify virus entry factors (hereafter referred to as 2nd generation panning for virus entry factor identification or simply 2nd generation panning)32,33. In 2nd generation panning, same as in 1st generation panning, cellular cDNA libraries are stably expressed in non-adherent cell lines by using a retroviral vector, but two additional non- or low-cytotoxic retroviral/lentiviral vectors which bear intended viral envelope proteins and whose genome encode either a membrane spanning protein or a fluorescence protein as a reporter are used for screening. Upon inoculation of library-expressing cells with a first screening vector encoding a membrane spanning protein, target cells would be specifically infected with the vector, express the reporter stably on cell surface, and form colonies on anti-reporter antibody-coated dishes during cell culture. Because infrequent infection of non-target cells with the screening vectors would occur and result in colony formation as authentic target cells, resultant colonies are superinfected with a second screening vector whose genome encode a fluorescence protein to eliminate false positive. Fluorescent colonies are found out under a fluorescence microscope and inserted cDNA recovered by PCR like with 1st generation panning. The ability to produce moderate to high titres of retroviral/lentiviral vectors bearing intended viral envelope proteins (as a guide, \u2265105 infectious units [IU]/mL) is a perquisite for 2nd generation panning. However, we have experienced cases in which some viruses (e.g., West Nile virus) did not meet the prerequisites for either method and for which virus entry factors could not be identified by our methods (data not shown).",

In members of this genus, non-evident cytopathic effects are characteristically observed in in vitro short cell culture15,34\u201336. The genome of the genus members is composed of three negative sense RNAs of large (L), middle (M), and small (S) segments, which encode viral proteins (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, glycoprotein [GP], and nuclear and non-structural proteins, respectively). The rescue of SFTS virus with or without mutations from cDNA (reverse genetics) has been reported37; in that study, five plasmids expressing three anti-genome RNAs and two viral proteins (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and nuclear protein) were used. As an application of the reverse genetics, a virus-like particle (VLP) assay was recently reported to assess the reassortment potential of SFTS virus with its related viruses Heartland virus (a member of the same genus) and Uukuniemi virus (a member of the genus Phlebovirus of the same family)38. Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus, a member of the family Nairoviridae of the same order, has similar characteristics to SFTS virus with regard to cytopathic effectivity, genome composition, transmission modes, and disease manifestations39\u201341.",

However, there are no reports on the application of category II methods with gain-of-function criteria in the identification of SFTS virus entry factors. In this report, we show the success of cellular cDNA library screening to identify SFTS virus entry factors with a novel method, which is combination of our 2nd generation panning32,33 and the reverse genetics for SFTS virus37,38 and is the first category II method with gain-of-function criteria applied for SFTS virus. Its application in the identification of previously unidentified SFTS virus entry factor(s), as well as entry factor(s) for viruses related to SFTS virus will be discussed.",

In contrast, the usage of a vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV G)-expression plasmid for the preparation of retroviral/lentiviral vectors resulted in moderate reporter expression (Fig. 1b). The retroviral/lentiviral vector titres determined by flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. S1) were as follows: 2.5 \u00d7102 IU/mL (retroviral \u2013 SFTS virus GP), 5.0 \u00d7 102 IU/mL (lentiviral \u2013 SFTS virus GP), 2.9 \u00d7 105 IU/mL (retroviral \u2013 VSV G), and 6.7 \u00d7 105 IU/mL (lentiviral \u2013 VSV G) (detection limit of the assay: 2.5 \u00d7 102 IU/mL).

In the assay, luciferase activity mirrors both the entry level of VLP and the replication and transcription levels of the luciferase gene-coding viral segment in VLP-inoculated cell populations. To develop an assay to identify SFTS virus entry factors, in which the identification or isolation of reporter-expressing cells among the VLP-inoculated cell population would be required, we used a fluorescence protein, Venus42, as a reporter. SFTS virus-based infectious VLP (iVLP) was prepared as described in the Methods and used to inoculate Vero cells. On the day after inoculation, inoculated cells showed fluorescence under a fluorescence microscope, as demonstrated in Fig. 2a (left). Additionally, the observation of the morphology of the inoculated cells revealed were no evident cytopathic effects (e.g., cell-rounding) in the inoculated cells. In contrast, when inoculated with iVLP, which was prepared with empty pCAGGS instead of pC030GP for the envelope protein expression (Fig. 2a, centre) or inoculated with medium (Fig. 2a, right), Vero cells showed no fluorescence. Flow cytometry confirmed expression of a fluorescence protein in cells inoculated with iVLP that was prepared with pC030GP (Fig. 2b). The iVLP titre determined with Vero cells was 6.0 \u00d7 105 IU/mL. The results strongly suggested that the observed fluorescence was derived from a reporter of iVLP (Venus), that its expression was SFTS virus GP-dependent, and that the identification of iVLP-infected cells would be possible.",

As shown in Fig. 2c, SFTS virus-neutralising IgG, but not normal human IgG, reduced the reporter expression upon iVLP inoculation in a dose-dependent manner. The neutralising IgG within similar ranges showed the inhibitory effects also on authentic SFTS virus infection (Supplementary Fig. S2). A nucleoside analogue 2\u2019-deoxy-2\u2019-fluorocytidine (2\u2019-FdC) has been reported to have strong inhibition activity against SFTS virus infection; the underlying mechanism of this is probably the inhibition of transcription/replication of the SFTS virus genome43. Vero cells were inoculated with iVLP in the presence of 2\u2019-FdC. As shown in Fig. 2d, 2\u2019-FdC reduced the reporter expression upon iVLP inoculation in a dose-dependent manner without cytotoxicity. An inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase, N-butyldeoxynojirimycin, was reported to reduce intracellular trafficking and/or penetrating process of SFTS virus infection16. The inhibitor, as shown in Fig. 2e, reduced the reporter expression upon iVLP inoculation in dose-dependent manners, although showed slight cytotoxicity at high doses (e.g. 25 and 100 \u03bcM). We previously reported that SFTS virus proliferation in Jurkat cells is enhanced by expression of C-type lectins (i.e., dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing non-integrin [DC-SIGN], DC-SIGN-related [DC-SIGNR], and liver and lymph node sinusoidal endotherial cell C-type lectin [LSECtin]) in the cells14. Therefore, we compared Jurkat cell susceptibility to iVLP with or without C-type lectin expression. Expression of each C-type lectin in Jurkat cells analysed by flow cytometry is shown in Supplementary Fig. S3. As shown in Fig. 2f, a control molecule (fCD2\u0394CT) did not enhance susceptibility of Jurkat cells to iVLP infection, however, in contrast, any of C-type lectins examined did.",

The 4 cell mixtures were separately inoculated with iVLP carrying fCD2\u0394CT reporter gene (iVLP[fCD2\u0394CT]) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 and on the following day subjected to panning with anti-fCD2 antibody. Trapped cells started to divide in the subsequent cell culture; however, 1 week later they detached from the antibody-coated panning dishes (data not shown). The detached cells were harvested, cultured for one additional week, then re-inoculated with iVLP(fCD2\u0394CT). Panning was then performed again. In this 2nd-round of panning, as shown in Fig. 3a, the numbers of trapped cells increased in ascending order as follows: Jurkat(0LS), Jurkat(10LS), Jurkat(100LS), and Jurkat(1000LS). Accumulation of LSECtin-expressing cells by repetition of iVLP infection and panning was confirmed by flow cytometry with anti-LSECtin antibody (Fig. 3b). The results indicated that iVLP-infected cells were able to continue cell division but that the reporter expression was reduced as cell division proceeded. Thus, SFTS virus-based iVLP could replace the retroviral/lentiviral vectors in 2nd generation panning for the identification of virus entry factors32,33; however, colonies should be picked up within 1 week after panning.",

Expression of each variant was confirmed by flow cytometry, with DC-SIGNR7r showing higher positivity (65%) than DC-SIGNR4r (35%, Fig. 5a). When inoculated, MOI-dependent expression of a reporter (Venus by iVLP[Venus]) or a viral protein (nuclear protein by SFTS virus) were observed within Jurkat cells expressing either of the two variants (Fig. 5b). The higher positivity of the reporter expression in DC-SIGNR7r-expressing cells than in DC-SIGNR4r-expressing cells (Fig. 5b) correlated with the variant positivity (Fig. 5a).

We focused on the established reverse genetics of the SFTS virus for viral genome manipulation37,38 and on a characteristic of SFTS virus that the virus shows no or weak cytotoxicity in infected cells15,34 and investigated whether SFTS virus-based vectors (iVLPs), like retroviral/lentiviral vectors, could be useful for identifying SFTS virus entry factors. Although the reporter expression by iVLP did not continue for more than one week, we screened a liver cDNA library with iVLPs and succeeded in identifying a C-type lectin, DC-SIGNR, which has been reported as an entry-enhancing factor13,14. Thus, even though the envelope protein of the virus did not show strong binding to the cell surface and conferred no or low retroviral/lentiviral titres, we showed that efficient gain-of-function screening for virus entry factor(s) could be performed using a VLP based on the virus itself (hereafter referred to as 3rd generation panning for virus entry factor identification or simply 3rd generation panning). To our knowledge, this is the first report on gain-of-function-based entry factor screening methods for SFTS virus. A prerequisite for 3rd generation panning is that the VLP does not significantly inhibit cell growth upon infection (for at least a few days), because the growth of cells, which obtain susceptibility to the intended viruses through the induction of cDNA clones and become infected with iVLP, is required for efficient selection32,33. From this viewpoint, it is unlikely that a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based pseudotyping system would work for such gain-of-function screening due to the high cytotoxicity of VSV replication, whereas envelope proteins of many viruses, including SFTS virus, confer infectivity to VSV-pseudotypes13,14. Another prerequisite is that moderate titres of VLP can be obtained\u2014as a guide, VLP titres of \u2265105 IU/mL without concentration are desired, because in screening approximately 107 library-expressing cells are generally needed in order to be infected at an MOI of 128\u201330,32,33. Usability of SFTS virus-based iVLP as a backbone is now under investigation to analyse entry mechanisms and/or viral particle-formation mechanisms and/or identify entry factors for other envelope viruses. Although we used SFTS virus as a backbone of the VLP for virus entry factor identification, the usage of VLPs based on other viruses (e.g., Guertu virus, Heartland virus and Uukuniemi virus, members of the same genus or family as SFTS virus) would be acceptable if the prerequisites are fulfilled. In particular, CCHF virus (like SFTS virus) shows no evident cytopathic effects39\u201341 and a VLP assay based on reverse genetics is available47. There is limited information on the entry mechanism of CCHF virus48,49 or the pathogenesis of CCHF39. We observed that glycoprotein of CCHF virus conferred relatively low retroviral/lentiviral vectors titres (data not shown). In addition, the disease manifestations in CCHF and SFTS patients display a large degree of overlap8,39. Thus, identification of CCHF virus entry factors using CCHF virus-based (or other virus-based) VLP might be feasible and may help to understand the pathogeneses of CCHF and SFTS.",

            "text": "It is presently unclear whether C-type lectins, including DC-SIGNR, can work as receptors for SFTS virus or as enhancers that facilitate receptor-mediated SFTS virus infection. A study with SFTS virus-related Uukuniemi virus showed the differential use of C-type lectins (DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR) for its endocytosis51. Nevertheless, because SFTS virus replicates efficiently in cell lines that do not express C-type lectins (e.g., Vero and Huh cells) in vitro8,12\u201314, other yet unidentified cellular factors are likely to be involved in SFTS virus cell entry. There are several possible reasons why no molecule rather than DC-SIGNR was identified in the present study: e.g., cDNA clones encoding other entry factors might be not included or truncated in the cDNA library used due to the length (long cDNAs tend to be missed or damaged during cDNA library preparation and/or retrovirus vector packaging) or there might be a viral entry route(s) for which more than one cellular molecules were necessary but lacked in cells used for library assessment (simultaneous identification of two or more molecules involving a single entry route is quite difficult in gain-of-function screening). Thus, Vero and Huh cells will be usable as sources of cDNA libraries. In addition, Raji and Molt-4 cells, which are highly resistant to SFTS virus infection13,14, may be usable as target cells to assess cDNA libraries. The use of different combinations of cDNA library origins/target cells rather than liver/Jurkat cells, which was used in this report, might lead to the identification of unidentified cellular factors involved in SFTS virus cell entry and may eventually lead to a better understanding of the viral tropism and the pathogenesis of SFTS.",

One is replication-competent SFTS virus whose genome encodes non-structural protein-reporter fusion protein or lacks non-structural protein gene but encodes a reporter53. Use of this virus for entry factor screening has never been reported but would probably result in low efficiency due to target cell damage and/or high background caused by its replication competency. The other is replication-incompetent SFTS virus whose genome encodes only reporters38. Because sufficient reporter expression upon the viral infection needs in-trans expression of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and nuclear protein in inoculated cells38, entry factor screening with this virus would be considerably complicated and the range of target cells usable for screening would be narrow. Because the genome of iVLP reported here encodes all viral proteins except GP (see Methods), iVLP is expected to be replication incompetent but does not require in-trans expression of viral proteins for detection of reporter in inoculated cells. Therefore, we believe that iVLP is the best tool for conducting gain-of-function screening to identify SFTS virus entry factors.",

In fact, we previously discovered a novel role of ribosomal protein S6 kinase alpha 3 (RSK2) in innate immune responses to influenza virus infection through identification of truncated RSK2 which dominates full length RSK2 and eventually increases reporter expression driven by influenza virus genome replication/transcription55.
