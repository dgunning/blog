The 83 HD patients and 12 medical staff were exposed to the MERS patient. Facing the possibility of a large epidemic, we had to follow the guidelines by National Disaster Management; thus, we decided to quarantine all exposed HD patients and medical staff in the hospital or their home. The medical staff caring for those patients had to wear level D personal protection equipment during work and were isolated in their homes after work2. Patients who were quarantined irrespective of their wishes suffered from isolation and fear of infection. Fortunately, no additional patients were infected with MERS-CoV, but all HD patients and medical staff experienced extreme physical and mental stress for the 17 days of isolation.",

            "text": "The staff required more time to prepare the dialysis treatment, including donning protection equipment and disinfecting the dialysis machines; thus, dialysis time was shortened slightly. Besides, the number of medical staff caring for the patients decreased, and face-to-face communication was limited. Laboratory findings showed decreases in Hb, Hct, and kt/v during quarantine although the change was subtle. It means the patients did not receive appropriate care. Considerable stress in itself could also have affected these clinical parameters. The levels of ccf-mtDNA as a stress marker were negatively correlated with those of Hb and Hct and positively associated with those of ferritin, an acute reactive protein. We had no sooner tried to correct anemia than MERS quarantine terminated. Significant increases in Hct at M3 reflected the effort. IS is protein-bound uremic retention that originates during intestinal fermentation10. IS concentrations were lower in HD patients maintaining a vegetarian diet compared with those in patients on a diet that included meat11. These results suggested that IS could be a nutritional marker. Our data also showed that the concentration of IS significantly increased after isolation. We speculated that the increase in IS levels related to nutrient recovery. HD patients and medical staff complained of poor meals and did not enjoy the food because they were provided only with lunch boxes. The increase in IS levels at M3 corresponded to the change of nutrition that accompanied the end of isolation.",

            "text": "This study found that circulating cf-DNA is abruptly elevated in not only patients but also medical staff. Living alone and working with protective equipment can cause high levels of mental and physical stress in not only patients but also healthcare workers during quarantine12,13. The result that the level of ccf-gDNA was higher in the HD patients under SRI reflected their severe stress. Levels of circulating cf-DNA steadily decreased in both patients and staff after isolation, but the decrease was delayed in the HD patients. Circulating cf-DNA in plasma indicates inflammation or cell death following cellular stress and tissue damage3. ccf-mtDNA containing CpG DNA repeats is known to attract neutrophils and activate immune cells14\u201317. Phagocytes quickly ingest the contents from apoptotic cells, therefore circulating cf-DNA is present in the circulation before phagocytes arrive18. When the engulfment of apoptotic bodies is reduced, or cell death is amplified, circulating cf-DNA can be substantially elevated19. Cellular apoptosis is common in HD patients due to chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction20,21. We suspected that more cells had undergone apoptotic and necrotic cell death or immune cells could not process circulating cf-DNA in HD patients. Also, chronic inflammation related to uremia, malnutrition, and calcification might have caused the late recovery of circulating cf-DNA. However, this study did not find a difference in the levels of circulating cf-DNA between HD patients and medical staff. Stress circumstances might be related to higher levels of ccf-mtDNA because chronic stress could alter the mitochondrial structure and lead to mitochondrial damage22,23. Healthcare workers, including nurses and medical doctors, are recognized as experiencing high levels of occupational stress24. Constantly elevated levels of circulating cf-DNA, especially ccf-mtDNA, are thought to reflect continuous occupational stress in our medical staff. We conducted a survey using Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) targeting the HD patients and medical staff at 12 months after the quarantine (Supplementary Fig. 3)25. The results identified the IES-R score at post-MERS was higher in medical staff than in HD patients. And post-MERS IES-R scores correlated positively with levels of ccf-mtDNA at M1. Healthcare workers responded with higher levels of psychological stress during the 2003 SARS outbreak26. They more easily recognize someone who will need to be hospitalized or die from infectious diseases. Thus, they might have worried more about becoming infected by MERS-CoV whenever they contacted patients. The higher IES-R scores in medical staff reflected the greater psychological impact and physical work stress. However, circulating cf-DNA was still not higher in HD patients than in medical staff at M3. If chronic inflammation was the only reason for the delay in processing circulating cf-DNA, it would be elevated in HD patients at M3. Therefore, insufficient care could be the main factor that caused the delayed recovery of circulating cf-DNA.",

These results indicated that continuous inflammation tends to exist in diabetic patients regardless of acute stress.

There was a significant positive correlation between PTX-3 and circulating cf-DNA levels at M0, which was the acute phase of isolation.
