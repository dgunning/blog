This tremendous evolvability, coupled with densely populated animal and plant susceptible hosts (in many cases lacking genetic variability for resistance to infection), are the reasons for the persistence and emergence of new viral diseases or the re-emergence of new strains with novel properties of already known diseases. The continuous emergence of new mutants leads to an overlap in existence of wild-type (hereafter referred to as wt) and mutant genotypes of the same virus within individual infected hosts [2,3]. This cloud of mutants is usually known as a viral quasi-species [1] and it constitutes the target of selection, instead of the individual viral genomes. This reservoir of coexisting genetic variants may lead to the emergence of new genotypes with different host ranges, pathologies and epidemiological properties that may result in outbreaks [4,5].",

Furthermore, some of these studies have also shown that dynamics are highly complex and do not only depend on the differences in replicative fitness among individual genotypes, but on other parameters such as the size and frequency of within-host bottlenecks, complementation of strains, fixation of additional mutations on the same genotype, epistasis, the availability of beneficial mutations (which indeed depends on the degree of adaptation to the host), the load of deleterious mutations or clonal interference among coexisting beneficial mutations [9\u201312].",

In the present article, we introduce mutation into a mathematical model in a similar way although avoiding forceful restrictions put upon mutant strains and allowing the mutant virus to have similar characteristics to the wt virus. The difference between mutant and wt strains occurs when focusing the study on specific phenotypic characteristics. A number of studies employ fitness to investigate the survival of a population in dynamical systems that present competition or coexistence [22\u201324]. As an accumulative property resulting from various phenotypic traits, fitness is a convenient measure of the overall success of the population. In the case of virus evolution, fitness can be considered proportional to the infection rate of the virus [25\u201327], and measured by the infection rate when other parameters are fixed. It is known that infection rates differ between strains, a fact which has significant implications for the evolution of virulence and strain coexistence in nature [28]. Even the balance between genetic diversity and competition is believed to be achieved due to the possibility of coexistence among strains with differences in infection rates [29]. In other words, a direct competition for infecting available cells mediates the stable coexistence only when competitive abilities in viral clones satisfy certain pairwise asymmetries [30].",

The evolution of virulence has received great attention from theoreticians, particularly on the coevolution between resistance and virulence traits and their combined effect on host and virus dynamics [32,33]. However, understanding the evolution of virulence for coexisting viral strains still requires attention due to the complexity of the underlying evolutionary and dynamical processes, being inherently nonlinear. Many of the models brought forward to explain the evolution of virulence take into consideration the processes of coinfection and superinfection [34\u201337], where the host or the host cell is infected simultaneously by more than one pathogen particle (coinfection) or sequentially by different pathogens (superinfection). Here, infection of a cell will be modelled with virions of a single strain and superinfection will be neglected. The benefit of this approach is that analytical insights into coexistence of viral strains can be obtained.",

We present analytical and numerical results focusing on the parameters related to the differential phenotypic traits of the wt and mutant strains. Conditions for coexistence and invasion have previously been studied using a mathematical model of one host shared between two competing parasites [38]. However, this model did not incorporate the mutation of parasites as a factor, and thus neglected the input of new strains into the system. Nearly all mathematical models in epidemiology detecting various dynamical behaviours with multi-strain infections illustrate the necessity of numerical approaches and the dependency of such models on a large number of parameters [39\u201343]. A classical approach used in epidemiology [44] to circumvent this difficulty is to introduce dimensionless parameter groups, such as the basic reproduction number R0, as in [45]. However, the number of dimensionless groups can still become large as additional complexity is introduced into the model, as is the case here. Thus, we perform a bifurcation analysis to systematically track how the dynamics of the system change as multiple parameters are varied. In general, the study of parameters in terms of their effect on the stability of certain states of a model is a highly effective way to gain important insights into the investigated system [46\u201348].",

The quantity \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b4 describes the effective growth rate of uninfected cells and its inverse, (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b4)\u22121, is used to define the characteristic time scale of the system. In a virus-free environment, the maximum size of the uninfected cell population is x~max=(1\u2212\u03b4/\u03b2)K, which is used to define the characteristic population size for both the uninfected and infected cells. The characteristic population size of the viral strains is chosen to be the product of the mutant burst size \u03bam and the characteristic size of the infected cell population, x~max. The former is required due to differences in sizes and measurement units of the viral loads and the cell populations in the system. We therefore non-dimensionalize the variables according to\n2.2t=(\u03b2\u2212\u03b4)\u22121t\u00af,x=x~maxx\u00af,yi=x~maxy\u00afi,zi=x~max\u03bamz\u00afi,where bars are used to denote dimensionless quantities. We also introduce dimensionless parameters defined by\n2.3\u03b1\u00afi=\u03bamK\u03b1i\u03b2,\u03bd\u00afi=\u03bdi\u03bam,\u03ba\u00af=\u03baw\u03bam,\u03bc\u00af=\u03bc\u03b2\u2212\u03b4,p\u00afi= pi\u03b2\u2212\u03b4,where pi (recall that i = m, w) stands for other \u2018rate\u2019 parameters, namely: \u03b3m, \u03b3w, \u03b6m and \u03b6w. Notice that all non-dimensional \u2018rate\u2019 parameters, including mutation \u03bc\u00af, are relative rates, i.e. the rate relative to the effective growth rate of uninfected cells. Meanwhile, non-dimensional parameters related to the virus populations are inevitably linked to the burst size due to the choice of z\u00afi. The non-dimensional burst size \u03ba\u00af is simply the ratio of the wt and mutant burst sizes. Both multiplicity of infections are scaled with respect to the burst size of the mutant strain. The dependence of the dimensionless infection rates \u03b1\u00afi on the burst size of the mutant-type-infected cells, the carrying capacity, growth rate of uninfected cells and dimensional infection rate shows how each of these quantities affects the overall rate of infection.",

The second equilibrium\n3.2v1 := {x=1, ym=0, yw=0, zm=0, zw=0},describes, whenever stable, a virus-free state whereby only the uninfected cells persist.

This inequality is a generalization of that derived for the mutant virus (\u03bdm < 1) which accounts for mutation. The singularity that occurs in the coexistence state v3 when C = 0 leads to difficulties when using numerical methods to track how this equilibrium evolves under parameter variation. The assumption of uni-directional mutation prevents the existence of an equilibrium point that is analogous to v2 whereby only the wt virus exists.",

Since v1 exists for all parameter combinations, transcritical bifurcations can be straightforwardly detected by forcing \u03bb to be zero in P2 and P3. By solving P2(\u03bb = 0) = 0, we find R0w=1, where\n3.8R0w:=\u03b1w\u03b6w(\u03ba1+\u03bc\u03b3w\u22121\u2212\u03bdw).Similarly, solving P3(\u03bb = 0) = 0 results in R0m=1, where\n3.9R0m:=\u03b1m\u03b6m(1\u2212\u03bdm).It will be shown below that R0w and R0m are the basic reproductive numbers for the wt and mutant strains, respectively.

By expanding v3 around R0w=1, we find that it has negative components when R0w<1 and thus lies outside of the biologically meaningful phase space. However, all of the components of v3 become positive when R0w>1. Likewise, expanding the equilibrium v2 around R0m=1 shows that this condition corresponds to points where the virus-free state v1 and wt-free state v2 intersect. For R0m<1, some components of v2 are negative; for R0m>1, all components are positive. In the case when both R0w=R0m=1 hold, there is a triple intersection of v1, v2 and v3. Furthermore, the Jacobian has a double zero eigenvalue at this point, indicating the onset of a non-degenerate or degenerate Bogdanov\u2013Takens bifurcation.

Similarly, for R0w>1 and R0m<1, the virus-free and coexistence state exchange stability: v1 becomes unstable, v3 becomes locally asymptotically stable, and v2 remains unstable. The stability in the region R0m>1 and R0w>1 is governed by the transcritical bifurcation occurring along the curve R0m=R0w, which leads to an exchange of stability between wt-free and coexistence states, v2 and v3. The transcritical bifurcations that occur for R0m=1 with R0w>1, R0w=1 with R0m>1 and R0m=R0w with R0w<1 do not result in an exchange of stability.

As predicted by the linear stability analysis in \u00a73.2, the wt-free state undergoes a supercritical Hopf bifurcation at \u03b1m = 1.55. The two critical values of \u03b1m divide the parameter space into three distinct regions. For \u03b1m < 0.44, the virus-free state v1 is locally asymptotically stable, corresponding to Region I in figure 2. Similarly, for 0.44 < \u03b1m < 1.55, the wt-free state v2 is stable, corresponding to Region II of figure 2. Finally, for \u03b1m > 1.55, there is a new region, termed Region IV, where stable POs exist about the equilibrium v2, which is unstable. These POs describe oscillatory populations of uninfected cells and mutant-type virus with extinct populations of the wt virus.",

The DBT bifurcation lies at the intersection of three curves of transcritical bifurcations satisfying R0w=1, R0m=1 and R0m=Rw, which may be written, respectively, in terms of the infection rates as\n3.13\u03b1w=\u03b6w\u03ba(1+\u03bc\u03b3w\u22121)\u22121\u2212\u03bdw,\u03b1m=\u03b6m1\u2212\u03bdm,\u03b1w\u03b1m=\u03b6w\u03b6m1\u2212\u03bdm\u03ba(1+\u03bc\u03b3w\u22121)\u22121\u2212\u03bdw.The bifurcation structure around the DBT point is identical to that predicted from the local stability analysis. Thus, we can eliminate from figure 4a the biologically irrelevant curves of transcritical bifurcations emerging from the DBT point in order to obtain the boundaries between Regions I, II and III shown in figure 4b. The DZH bifurcation occurs at the simultaneous intersection of two curves of Hopf bifurcations associated with v2 and v3 and the curve of transcritical bifurcations involving v2 and v3. As predicted from linear stability analysis, the Hopf bifurcation curve associated with the wt-free state v2 does not depend on the infection rate of the wt virus \u03b1w and thus appears as a straight line given by \u03b1m = 1.55. Emanating from the DZH point is a curve of TPO bifurcations. To better understand the dynamics that occur near the DZH point, one-dimensional bifurcation diagrams are obtained by setting \u03b1w = 8 and treating \u03b1m as a bifurcation parameter and then setting \u03b1m = 2 and treating \u03b1w as the bifurcation parameter.

None of these bifurcations change the stability of the equilibria. Thus, the associated curves of transcritical and Hopf bifurcations in figure 4a do not represent boundaries between the five characteristic regions and are not shown in figure 4b. For these infection rates, all of the equilibria are unstable and the dynamics are therefore determined by the stability of POs. For sufficiently small values of \u03b1m, the system is in Region V, and there is a stable PO around the coexistence state v3. This PO is created by the Hopf bifurcation that defines the boundary between Regions III and V shown in figure 4b. As \u03b1m is increased, the unstable POs around the wt-free state v2 that emerge from the subcritical Hopf bifurcation grow in size. Eventually, this unstable PO collides and exchanges stability with the stable PO around v3 through a TPO bifurcation at \u03b1m = 2.3972. During the TPO bifurcation, the stable and biologically meaningful PO around v3 becomes unstable and some components enter negative phase space. Afterwards, the PO around the wt-free state is stable and the system is in Region IV.",

In population genetics, this corresponds to the most simple case of the emergence and persistence of a polymorphism in a population and maintenance of biodiversity. An example of an experiment that illustrates a simplified competition was conducted for Escherichia coli in [67]. These experiments focused on studying the behaviour of a newly emerging mutant in a population of a few strains of bacteria that compete with each other in a spatially homogeneous environment for the same type of nutrients. The results of the competition experiments demonstrate that in the vast majority of cases, the competitors stably coexist in steady or periodic states, which align with the outcome of our theoretical model. When even a slight change is possible in the genome, new mutations will appear. However, if all the other characteristics of an initial and a mutant population are the same, then, for both populations to persist, the initial population must have larger fitness than a mutant population. Otherwise, the initial population will be out-competed because of the constant \u2018leak\u2019 into the mutant population.

In the limit of very large virulence, \u03b3w \u2192 \u221e, we find that R0w\u2192\u03b1w(\u03ba\u2212\u03bdw)/\u03b6w. Thus, if the infection rate \u03b1w is so small that the limit of R0w is less than one, then it will not be possible to leave Region I and both strains of the virus will always become extinct. However, if \u03b1w is sufficiently large and the basic reproduction number increases beyond one, then a change in dynamics will be observed as \u03b3w is increased. By solving R0w=1, a critical value of the virulence of the wt virus is obtained\n3.15\u03b3wcrit=\u03bc\u03ba(\u03b6w\u03b1w\u22121+\u03bdw)\u22121\u22121.The above equation is the condition for a transcritical bifurcation between the virus-free state v1 and the coexistence state v3 and defines the boundary between Regions I and III. Thus, only for values of \u03b3w>\u03b3wcrit will the virus persist in the system for this choice of infection rates.",

Thus, variations in the virulence cannot bring the system to Region I and at least one type of virus will always persist. A transition between Regions II and III can occur via the transcritical bifurcation between the wt-free and coexistence states v2 and v3. The critical condition for this transcritical bifurcation is given by equation (3.10), and depends only on the virulence of the wt viral strain. Thus, the transition between Regions II and III appears as the vertical dashed line in figure 6b. Interestingly, this figure shows that as the virulence of the wt virus is increased, the system transitions from Region III to Region V and then back to Region III. These transitions occur via supercritical Hopf bifurcations, denoted by solid lines. This scenario corresponds to the so-called bubble bifurcation (found in other epidemiological systems, e.g. [68]), in which the system is in a stationary state, then enters into an oscillating one, and finally goes back to a stationary state as the control parameter is changed.",

Clearly, the virulence of the mutant strain does not affect the survival of the wt strain. That is, increases in \u03b3m do not lead to an appearance or disappearance of the wt strain. However, the survival of the mutant strain does not appear to depend on \u03b3m either. Importantly, the virulence of the wt strain, \u03b3w, strongly controls the dynamics and the persistence of the wt strain. As can be seen for small values of \u03b3w, this strain can become extinct as shown in figure 6b. In other words, even for a superior infection rate of the wt viral strain, there is a threshold of \u03b3w that must be surpassed in order for this strain to exist. For inferior values that are below this threshold, the survival of the wt strain is impossible because the rate of wt virion production, i.e. the death of rate infected cells, is insufficient. The qualitative behaviour of solutions, i.e. whether the populations of wt strains undergo oscillations or stabilize to a certain value, depends on the virulence in a non-trivial way. As shown in figure 6b, there is an interval of values for \u03b3w for which the system has a stable PO governing the coexistence of strains, marked as Region V. Outside of this interval, the populations reach stable stationary states.",

This is a key parameter that has been largely investigated within the framework of the error threshold [69,70] and lethal mutagenesis [71] in quasi-species theory. In general, the coexistence of two strains requires the basic reproduction number of the wt virus to be greater than one, R0w>1, which can be interpreted as a condition on the mutation rate:\n3.17\u03bc<\u03b3w(\u03ba\u03b6w\u03b1w\u22121+\u03bdw\u22121).Thus, for two strains to coexist, the mutation rate must be sufficiently small. This result supports a conjecture that excess mutation exhausts the population of the wt strain, thereby leading to a process similar to the well-known error catastrophe [70]. We would expect that a gradual increase of the mutation rate contributes to a better success of the mutant strain as the frequency of mutants generated de novo increases. The right-hand side of (3.17) is an increasing function of \u03b1w, reflecting the fact that a greater rate of infection by the wt virus will offset a greater mutation rate. A stability diagram in terms of the mutation rate \u03bc and the wt infection rate \u03b1w is shown in figure 7a for the case of \u03b1m = 0.1 and using parameter values in (3.12). The dashed line marking the boundary between Regions I and III, and also defining the region of coexisting populations, has been obtained by replacing the inequality with equality in (3.17). As the infection rate \u03b1w increases, the boundary between Regions I and III reaches a horizontal asymptote given by\n3.18\u03bcc=\u03b3w(\u03ba\u03bdw\u22121).For mutation rates that satisfy \u03bc < \u03bcc, Regions III and V can be entered from Region I by increases in the infection rate, promoting coexistence. However, for \u03bc > \u03bcc, only the wt-free state can occur. Hence, equation (3.18) defines a critical, finite mutation rate at which coexistence no longer becomes possible due to extinction of the wt virus due to the outcompetition by the mutant strains. To explore this in more detail, we have repeated the stability diagram shown in figure 4b using a value of \u03bc = 0.5 > \u03bcc. The stability diagram changes drastically, becoming that shown in figure 7b, and contains only three regions: I, II and IV. The stability diagrams in figure 4b and 7b are linked through the fact that as the mutation rate increases, the DBT bifurcation shifts to the right, eventually tending to infinity as the critical value is approached.\n",

Furthermore, the DBT and the DZH bifurcations have vanished, the latter of which implies that the curve of TPO bifurcations no longer exists either.

Unlike previous models of parasite\u2013host-like interaction, we consider the emergence of a second strain by mutation from a single strain introduced into the environment. The mechanism of virus replication forces the consideration of two types of infected cells, one for each viral strain, in the model. We analysed the system of differential equations and its solutions. By studying parameters space, we identified five different regions, each characterized by distinct dynamics: (Region I) the virus-free state which maximizes the population of host cells, (Region II) the stationary existence of mutant virus with nonzero cell populations supporting it, (Region III) the stationary persistence of both viral strains with nonzero cell populations, (Region IV) the oscillating existence of the mutant virus and corresponding cell populations but extinct wt virus population, and finally, (Region V) the oscillating coexistence of all populations.",

The broken symmetry between the wt and mutant strains is clear from the stability diagrams based on infection rates. From our results, we observe that survival of the wt virus is essential for coexistence. However, the growth of the wt virus population jeopardizes its persistence in the system by creating its own competitor: the mutant-type virus. Moreover, the larger the mutation rate, the greater the infection rate of the original wt strain should be in order to remain in the system. Interestingly, we have found a maximum\u2014critical value\u2014of the mutation rate in the context of the model which allows for the persistence of the wt strain and hence coexistence. Values of the mutation rate that are higher than the critical value make coexistence impossible even for the most infectious wt strain. Furthermore, our model shows that the concept of the error threshold may not be considered as a one-parameter-driven effect, i.e. based solely on the mutation rate [69,70]. The critical value of mutation is shown here to be proportional to the virulence and burst size of the wt virus and proportionally inverse to its multiplicity of infection. Hence, our results extend the phenomenon of the error threshold at the infected cell population level.",
