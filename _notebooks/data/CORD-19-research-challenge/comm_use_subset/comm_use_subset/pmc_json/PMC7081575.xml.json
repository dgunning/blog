            "text": "Recently, a variety of infectious diseases with high rates of spread and mortality have been frequent. In addition, it has been reported that high contagious infectious diseases are spreading through various routes and carriers for recent two decades. It is important to prevent from spreading out a number of infectious diseases earlier in the outbreak of the causing agents because of our rapid transportation population density. Therefore, prompt supplying of vaccines should be secured within a limit time, even at unexpected times and places. The speed of vaccine development is also a very critical issue. Thus, safety of the vaccines also should be assured. Nevertheless, it is difficult to obtain sufficient time to perform a complete safety evaluation for a rapid supply of urgent vaccines. It is very unfortunate that we have already mentioned in the previous report that there is not global standard for the safety assessment of these newly develop urgent vaccines.",

We conducted several experiments to evaluate the safety of vaccines, and presented the ideal combination of the experiments: susceptible mice types according to the effective concentration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) destroying Blood-brain barrier (BBB), the appropriate LPS exposure time destroying BBB, origin type of LPS (Salmonella enterica), and injection route of LPS. In this study, we tried to evaluate whether the previously established assessment method could be available for evaluating brain safety rapidly with two commercial vaccines easily accessible vaccines (a killed- and a live-vaccine). We confirmed in the present study that the pre-established \u201cvaccine safety module for the brain\u201d was highly reproducible in the evaluation of the safety results by the commercially available vaccines.",

The LPS from S.enterica serotype enteritidis (L6011; Sigma, USA) was dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4). Two types of commercially available vaccines were used as experimental groups. One is a killed vaccine, a porcine genital respiratory syndrome vaccine (Suishot PRRS, Choongang vaccine, Korea). The other one is a live vaccine, a canine parvovirus vaccine (Zoetis Inc., USA). The concentration of the stock solution of these two vaccines is 0.5 \u00d7 107.0 TCID50/ml. We set these concentrations to assess the effect of these vaccines on the BBB, depending on the concentration. Through the previous studies we confirmed that the effective BBB destroyed concentration of these vaccines was 2-fold concentration of the stock solutions. Therefore, the experiment was conducted under three conditions: 2-fold concentration of the stock solution, reference concentration of the stock solution and 10-fold diluted concentration of the stock solution. Including negative control and positive control, the groups were divided 8 groups according to vaccine types and concentrations: group 1, PBS/EB(n = 2); group2, LPS/EB(n = 2); group3, 2-fold concentration of the porcine vaccine/EB (P1, n = 5); group4, reference concentration of the porcine vaccine/EB (P2, n = 5); group5, 10-fold diluted concentration of the porcine vaccine/EB (P3, n = 5); group6, 2-fold concentration of the canine vaccine/EB (C1, n = 5); group7, reference concentration of the canine vaccine/EB (C2, n = 5); group8, 10-fold diluted concentration of the canine vaccine/EB (C3, n = 5).

            "text": "Humans and live stocks are easily exposed to the risk of infectious diseases caused by various micro-organisms such as bacteria and virus on a daily basis. This has become a very important issue as it affects health in our daily lives [1]. Once a high contagious infectious disease occurs, it can spread to other countries in an instant [4]. Thus, it is not limited to any region or country. Rapid supply of vaccines that are effective in emergency situations is essential to prevent the spread of such infectious diseases [15]. However, in urgent situation, both quick supply of vaccine and safe vaccine are important. All important biological actions of humans and live stocks are regulated and maintained primarily by the central nervous system (CNS), especially the brain [1, 14, 16]. Brain is a complex network of numerous neurons. It is an important organ for regulating body homeostasis, behaviors, memory, and learning [20\u201322]. This important organ is protected by a structure known as the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [8]. Neurons in the brain and spinal cord are in directly contact with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [19]. They are supplied with oxygen and nutrients. When blood and CSF circulate, the material can selectively penetrate because the BBB limits mass transfer into brain parenchyma [11, 18]. It is believed that the brain can examine components of blood and only let required substances selectively pass [2]. If the BBB is exposed to any toxic substance, chronic high blood pressure, radiation, viruses, or bacteria, it can lead to brain problem [3, 18]. If a newly developed vaccine or urgent vaccine fails to secure brain safety, brain parenchyma might become damaged and the health of the recipient may not be assured [1]. This can become can be a serious public health hazard and result in serious economic damage to industrial animals. Therefore, the safety assessment module we designed was focused on how to effectively measure effects of various vaccines on the stability of BBB in laboratory animals [1]. The BBB is formed by a tight junction between endothelial cells of blood vessels distributed throughout the CNS. It contains junctional molecules (JAM), zonula occludens (ZO), claudin, and occluding [3, 5\u20137, 9\u201312]. These structures are key components of tight junction of BBB [3, 5\u20137, 9, 10]. In our previous study, we have established a condition for positive control that can destroy the BBB structure by damage to the tight junction using LPS mentioned earlier [1]. These conditions include mouse species, age, type, concentration of LPS, injection routes to mice, and exposure time after injection. EB assay, qPCR, and Western blot analysis can be conducted under the condition of positive control to determine whether the BBB is destroyed [2, 3, 9, 11, 13, 17, 18]. In the present study, we confirmed that these established conditions and modules of the positive control that destroyed the BBB could be used to assess brain safety of commercial vaccines [1].",

            "text": "Results of EB assay revealed that EB dye permeability of P1 group was higher than that of the PBS/EB group but lower than that of the LPS/EB group. Based on this, we could not conclude that the BBB was damaged in the vaccine concentration of the P1 group. On the other hand, the permeability of EB dye in the C1 group was similar or higher than that in the LPS/EB group, meaning that BBB was damaged at vaccine concentration of C1 group. The same concentration of vaccine was injected. However, higher permeability of EB dye was seen in the C1 group. This result may be due to different vaccine types of porcine and canine vaccines. Since the porcine vaccine is a killed-vaccine and the canine vaccine is a live-vaccine, the canine vaccine is more damaging to BBB. This was also confirmed by qPCR results of ZO-1 mRNA levels. As expected, at reference concentration and 10-fold diluted concentration of stock solution of two vaccines, EB dye permeability and relative ZO-1 and occludin mRNA levels were comparable to those of the negative control, meaning no significant damage to the BBB. Occludin mRNA expression was lower than ZO-1 mRNA expression level at 2-fold diluted concentration of the stock solution which was considered to be damaging to BBB [1]. We have previously examined permeability of EB dye and changes in mRNA and protein expression of ZO-1 and occludin over time after LPS injection. After 4 h of LPS injection, ZO-1 mRNA levels were dynamic and rapidly increased. The level of occludin mRNA increased after 4 h of injection, but increased rapidly after 24 h. These results are highly correlated with our previous findings. However, in order to provide a rapid supply of urgent vaccines, rapid verification is required. Considering this, 4 h after injection of LPS was established as a positive control condition of the module for evaluating BBB damage. Consistent with results of previous studies, ZO-1 levels, but not occludin levels, were increased rapidly after 4 h of vaccine injection. Therefore, when a commercially available vaccine is applied to our positive control and rapid safety assay modules, ZO-1 tight junction primer is more suitable for qPCR. In addition, we have purposed three assays of EB assay, qPCR, and western blot as methods to determine damage to BBB in our previous study [1]. However, since this module is aimed at assessing the safety of urgent vaccines, western blot analysis which requires a relatively long time might not be suitable. Therefore, EB assay and qPCR would be more effective methods for rapid evaluation. It is recommended that we refer to an illustration of our research process on the safety assessment of vaccines (Fig. 3).",

However, in order for this module to be used in practice, it is necessary to apply more types of vaccines to the module. Since there are many kinds of vaccines, they should be repeatedly applied and evaluated using this module. Taken together, the usefulness of the rapid brain safety test module that we constructed previously was verified using vaccines commercially available in the veterinary market in Korea. Our results were highly reproducible. Therefore, this evaluation module can be utilized in the future to assess the safety of various vaccines and adjuvants.",
