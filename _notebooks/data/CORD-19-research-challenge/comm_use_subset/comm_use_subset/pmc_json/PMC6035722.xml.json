Owners who consider companion animals to be family members, expect their dogs to have good health. Changes in living environments, improvements in nutrition, and the development of veterinary medical technology, including the prevention of infectious diseases, as well as better diagnostic approaches and disease management, have resulted in a gradual increase of the average lifespan of the companion dog (Butterwick, 2015; Guglielmini, 2003; Sabnis & Rathbone, 2013). However, as the dog lifespan has increased, chronic and degenerative diseases have become more prevalent (Bonnett et al., 2005; Bonnett & Egenvall, 2010; Fleming, Creevy & Promislow, 2011).",

In recent years, various investigators have used demographic information of companion dogs to assess health issues and disease prevalences within particular populations. In addition, mortality and morbidity in a variety of countries have been reported, stratified by age and breed (Bonnett & Egenvall, 2010; Egenvall et al., 2005; Fleming, Creevy & Promislow, 2011; Proschowsky, Rugbjerg & Ersb\u00f8ll, 2003). Large dog breeds have been noted to exhibit a shorter expected lifespan than small dog breeds (Fleming, Creevy & Promislow, 2011; Michell, 1999; Proschowsky, Rugbjerg & Ersb\u00f8ll, 2003); further, mixed breed dogs have a higher average lifespan than purebred dogs, except for Poodles and Border Collies (O\u2019Neill et al., 2013; Proschowsky, Rugbjerg & Ersb\u00f8ll, 2003). A previous report found that male dogs tended to have higher mortality rates due to trauma, whereas female dogs showed higher rates of neoplasms (Egenvall et al., 2005). Some breeds, such as Golden Retrievers and Boxers, die of cancer more frequently than other breeds (Fleming, Creevy & Promislow, 2011). These reports show that breed and age are major risk factors for mortality in dogs.",

Moreover, some types of diseases, such as heart disease, often show no signs, even when the disease has progressed and the patient has been significantly affected (Atkins et al., 2009). For these reasons, dog owners and veterinarians require guidelines to improve early diagnoses and prevent diseases throughout all life stages of the dog. Understanding the prevalence of diseases, according to breed and age-related disease patterns, would support better guidance for future health care strategies and provide useful information for more effective early diagnoses.",

We included no specialists, referral clinics, or teaching hospitals in this study. Before collecting data for this survey, data use agreements were signed by veterinary practitioners from each clinic when they agreed to provide their medical records. The data included clinical information, such as presenting signs or diagnoses of major health problems, reasons for the visit, and related clinical procedures. All clinical data were recorded by the veterinarians at their practices. A proprietary electronic medical record system (EMR; Into Vet., Inc, Into CNS, Seoul, ROK) was used for data collection; it included the animal identification number, age, breed, gender, neuter status, clinical information (clinical signs, client complaints, lab procedures), and diagnosis. The data collection procedure was performed in cooperation with the EMR software company.

The classification includes two general categories of International Classification of Disease (ICD) for human disease. Clinical notes and diagnosis terms included in the data were reviewed in detail by a veterinary researcher with clinical experience and were reworked as a list of terms using the most appropriate the standard nomenclature of veterinary disease and operations. The most definitive diagnostic term recorded for each disorder within an individual patient\u2019s record was manually classified using the ICD from the World Health Organization (ICD-10 version, WHO). For example, otitis externa was classified as \u201cDiseases of the ear or mastoid process,\u201d and heartworm was classified as \u201cCertain infectious or parasitic diseases.\u201d Consequences involving external causes, such as trauma including injury, accident involving fracture, and wound including lacerations, tear and bit wounds that involved by soft tissues were classified within \u201cInjury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes.\u201d Some of the terms combined nomenclature which is broad informed terms were used in this study. For example, the term \u201cdiarrhea\u201d included watery diarrhea, mucosae diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and melena. The term \u201cvomiting\u201d included vomiting, regurgitation, and hematemesis. Most records were as classified in a main category of ICD and were not grouped into sub-categories. Dental problems, such as gingivitis and periodontal disease, were grouped within \u201cDental disorder.\u201d Vaccinations for infectious diseases and heartworm prevention were grouped within \u201cPreventive medicine,\u201d because of this category\u2019s importance in veterinary practice.

For these types of surveys, a variety of data sources can be used to examine disease prevalence patterns. Veterinary teaching hospitals, referral practices with specialists, primary-care veterinary clinics, insured animal data, Kennel club registrations, questionnaires, and internet-based surveys are commonly used to conduct demographic or health condition research in companion animals (Bonnett & Egenvall, 2010; Diez et al., 2015; Dorn, 2000; Egenvall et al., 2005; Gobar, Case & Kass, 1998; Kubinyi, Turcs\u00e1n & Mikl\u00f3si, 2009; O\u2019Neill et al., 2014; Zur, Lifshitz & Bdolah-Abram, 2011). Veterinary EMR data have been proposed as a statistically valuable source of information for clinical research in dogs (O\u2019Neill et al., 2014, 2015; S\u00e1nchez-Vizca\u00edno et al., 2015). EMR data have a number of benefits: they are not difficult to acquire, they provide a wide range of comprehensive information, and they allow a wide range of multi-dimensional analyses. Currently, most veterinary clinics in ROK use EMRs for their practice management. The system is convenient for storing and sorting patient information, and it is easy to search desired categorical information. Notably, there were >400 signs, diagnostic terms, and descriptions of owners\u2019 concerns in the collected data. For these reasons, some of the standard terms could be not used in the traditional manner. For example, \u201cheart disease\u201d was used when recorded terms were cardiomegaly, heart failure, valve disease, and cardiac murmurs, while upper \u201crespiratory tract disease\u201d included presenting signs or diagnoses such as cough and sneezing.",

Hence, we used the ICD category system from WHO for disease classification to reduce confusion associated with the meanings of the terms.

In a previous study, most dogs that visited vets were the <1-year-old or 4-to-7-year-old groups in the USA (Lund et al., 1999); a demographic study in the UK showed that 0-to-1-year-old dogs were the highest proportion, with clinic visits slightly decreasing with increasing age (S\u00e1nchez-Vizca\u00edno et al., 2017). These results are different than our study in that the <1-year-old population was a lower proportion of our total. The average age was 4.8 years and the oldest age was 20 years in this study. Most researchers have insisted that the average age of pet dogs has been increasing, and that their expected lifespan is longer (Egenvall et al., 2005; O\u2019Neill et al., 2013). This study shows that the proportion of >10-years-old dogs was higher than the proportion of <1-year-old dogs.

            "text": "The most popular breed was Maltese, followed by Poodle, Pomeranian, Shih Tzu, Yorkshire Terrier, Chihuahua, and mixed breed. These seven breeds comprised 74.7% of the total dogs in this study. Approximately 24.1% of the population own dogs, and approximately 6.62 million dogs are present in the ROK (Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency, 2017). In a recent survey (Proportionate quota sampling, Online survey) of major cities in the ROK, including Seoul and six other metropolitan cities, Maltese was the most popular breed (21.2%), followed by Shih Tzu (11.7%), poodle (11.4%), mixed breed (6.1%), Yorkshire terrier (5.2%), and Pomeranian (5.1%) (Korean Pet Food Association, 2017). Notably, small dogs are the major varieties, consistent with the results of the present study. However, due to the limited methodology of the data collection, it might not reflect all small breed dogs in the ROK. Several studies found a general trend for small breeds to have a longer expected life span than large breeds (Egenvall et al., 2005; Fleming, Creevy & Promislow, 2011; O\u2019Neill et al., 2013; Proschowsky, Rugbjerg & Ersb\u00f8ll, 2003). In addition, disease prevalences were affected by breed (Dorn, 2000; Harvey, 1998; Lund et al., 1999; Miller et al., 2016). Because most breeds in ROK are small and toy breeds, veterinarian practices will need to focus on the conditions that most affect these breeds. Additionally, knowledge of the risk of various diseases in these breeds is very useful in developing a differential diagnosis and selecting treatments more effectively.",

            "text": "Previous reports suggest that the prevalence of disease is affected by age, as well as by breed (Bonnett & Egenvall, 2010; Egenvall et al., 2005). We analyzed the frequency and distribution of medical problems by life stage (<1 year of age and every three years, from one to 16 years). Young dogs, for example, are more easily exposed to infectious diseases, such as parvovirus or coronavirus, and intestinal parasites, even though the proportion of preventive medicine is higher, and the prevalence of trauma such as falls, accidents, and factures is also higher than in older age groups. The prevalence of progressive diseases, such as neoplasm, heart diseases, and arthritis is related to age group as well (Bonnett & Egenvall, 2010; Egenvall et al., 2005). This study shows that some kinds of progressive or degenerative diseases had a higher prevalence in older groups than in younger groups, including circulation disorders (e.g., heart disease), neoplasms (e.g., mammary tumors), musculoskeletal disorders (e.g., lameness), and hormonal disorders (e.g., Cushing\u2019s disease). The prevalence of heart diseases increases with age in small breed dogs, and dogs older than eight years have a reduced survival time, compared to younger dogs (Guglielmini, 2003; Templeton et al., 1976). A previous study showed the mean age for dogs with heart disease was 10.6 \u00b1 2.62 years. This study revealed a similar result, in which the prevalence of heart disease was significantly different, according to age (p < 0.05). Additionally, heart disease is a high-risk factor in terms of mortality in dogs (Bonnett & Egenvall, 2010; Egenvall et al., 2005; Hoummady et al., 2016). Age-related changes of cardiovascular function in dog affect the prevalences of not only hypotension, blood velocity, arterial compliance, and dispensability (Haidet et al., 1996; Miller, Nealeigh & Crowder, 1976), but also increased ventricular systolic and diastolic stiffness associated with prolonged duration of myocardial contractility (Templeton et al., 1976). In dogs, heart disease has been related to serious conditions, including progressive heart failure, pulmonary edema and/or congestion, hypertension, left arterial rupture, and pericardial tamponade (Borgarelli et al., 2008; Guglielmini, 2003; Pouchelon et al., 2015). These reasons might reflect the result that increasing the prevalence of respiratory disorder in presented study. Some types of canine patients with class I heart disease have no clinical signs that are evident, even during exercise. However, this disease status can change frequently and dramatically over short periods of time (Guglielmini, 2003). In older dogs, especially those >10 years, regular heart exams that may include heart rate, auscultation, radiography, and echocardiogram, are recommended.",

In addition, tumors of the mammary gland were the most common type, with a mean percentage of malignancy of 50.9% in female dogs (Kustritz, 2007; Sorenmo, 2003). Increasing age is the most significant risk factor for the development of mammary gland tumors in dogs, with a mean age at diagnosis of approximately 8.4\u201310 years (Chang et al., 2005; Kustritz, 2007). We also observed increased rates of mammary tumors in the >10 years old age groups. Sexually intact status is a major risk factor for the development of mammary gland tumors; sexually intact dogs have a seven-fold increased risk for developing mammary gland tumors with increasing age, compared with the risk for spayed dogs (Misdorp, 1988; Kustritz, 2007). Hence, as age increases, unneutered female dogs should have regular health checkups, especially with regard to mammary gland tumors.",

These diseases are considered to be associated with diet, breed, and aging (Harvey, 1998; Lund et al., 1999). Although tooth brushing, dental scaling and polishing removes plaque and calculus from all tooth surfaces, one study confirmed that as soon as tooth brushing stops, gingival inflammation develops rapidly (Ingham & Gorrel, 2001). Continuous periodontal care is an important factor for managing oral problems. Small animal practitioners should perform more thorough checkups of the oral cavity because our study showed a low rate of dental diseases than expected, even though it is known that the prevalence of dental disease is quite high (Lund et al., 1999; O\u2019Neill et al., 2014).",

Although previous reports have demonstrated various breed distributions of medical conditions, our results clearly differ from those regarding distributions of dog breeds in other countries. The main breeds in ROK are small dogs and toy dogs. Common causes for visiting the veterinary clinic were similar across these breeds: preventive medicine, otitis externa, dermatitis or eczema, and diarrhea and vomiting. These medical problems, manifested as brown ears (externa otitis), itching on skin, or diarrhea and vomiting, are simple for owners to recognize, which is reflected in our results. However, some of these health problems are not obvious to the owner and can only be detected with by veterinary diagnosis. Notably, purebred dogs of many breeds and some mixed breed dogs are prone to congenital or heritable diseases (Asher et al., 2009; Dorn, 2000). In pedigree dogs, hip dysplasia, patella luxation, entropion, retinal atrophy, elongated soft palate, skin fold dermatitis, uterine inertia, elbow dysplasia, lens luxation, ectropion, and trichiasis have been commonly identified (Asher et al., 2009; Hodgman, 1963). As dogs aged, skin diseases, including dermatitis or eczema, malassezia infection in skin, dermatomycoses, skin pruritus, and pyoderma show high prevalence across breeds. We did not know which problems were heritable diseases; however, a previous report noted that some purebred dogs could be affected by various endogenous risk factors, such as hyperadrenocorticism in Poodle, hypothyroidism in Doberman Pinscher, and zinc-responsive skin diseases in Cocker Spaniel and Alaskan malamute (Miller et al., 2013; Scott & Paradis, 1990).",

Notably, it is difficult to detect early skin disease in long hair breeds, such as the major breeds of this study (Maltese, Toy Poodle, Pomeranian, Shih Tzu, and Yorkshire Terrier). The estimated proportion of dogs with allergic or atopic dermatitis might be under-estimated by primary veterinary practices because mild cases are often well-managed with symptomatic therapy without a specific diagnosis. Additionally, the prevalence of canine atopic dermatitis could be variably affected by type of veterinary practice, geographical region, survey methodology, study population selection, and/or criteria for establishing a diagnosis of disease (Hillier & Craig, 2001).",

Otitis externa is known to be related to skin diseases; it exhibits breed predisposition, with excessive hair in and around ear, typically in long-coated breeds (Hayes, Pickle & Wilson, 1987; Strain, 1996). The incidence of otitis externa in this study supports the assumption that it is a breed-related condition (p < 0.001).",

Additionally, conformation character, such as median entropion, tends to be more common in brachycephalic breeds with prominent nasal folds, including Shih Tzu, Pekingese, English Bulldog, and Pug (Christmas, 1992).",

These surgeries are commonly recommended as prevention for genital disorders, such as pyometra, mammary tumors, testicular tumors, and prostatic neoplasia and behavioral problems, such as mounting and urine spraying (Kustritz, 2007). However, in house dogs, overweight or obese statuses were highly prevalent among neutered dogs; the most commonly reported risk factor for obesity was gonadectomy (Asher et al., 2009). Even though we did not analyze body weight, it is an important factor contributing to life quality and longevity in companion dogs (Fleming, Creevy & Promislow, 2011; O\u2019Neill et al., 2013). A limitation of this study is that it is not a comprehensive, representative survey of the entire ROK. It is considered to be relevant for indoor dogs living in big cities, because it is aimed at primary veterinary clinics in Seoul, the largest city in ROK, and Jeonju, a smaller city. Therefore, it is not likely to be applicable to rural areas. Furthermore, if signs alone were considered when observing or consulting cases in veterinary clinics, some of the most frequently encountered breed-specific and congenital problems, and a variety of diseases that result from conformation character, malformation, and/or endocrine disorders would be missed because owners might not recognize them or regard them as important. Understanding why these types of problems tend to occur at higher rates than in other breeds may help in deciding when they should be prioritized; for owners, regular visits to the veterinarian for health screening can help identify these undetected problems and allow better treatment and management of some problems in earlier stages.",

Because most of the dog breeds in ROK are small and toy breeds, which are expected to have a long lifespan, we need to design appropriate approaches for them. The information in this study could provide information to educate owners, improve strategies for disease prevention, and enable management of problems earlier and more effectively. Ideally, it would be helpful to establish guidelines for primary health care at the national level. Additionally, various dimensions of analysis are required to determine the trends for factors affecting disease patterns. To our knowledge, no other study has performed this type of analysis using comparable methods to collect EMR data from a large sample of dogs in the ROK. This is the first study that describes disease patterns and occurrences according to age. There is a need for further studies to provide a more comprehensive analysis according to age groups within breeds.",
