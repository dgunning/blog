The majority of studies regarding childhood AOM reported that the incidence peaked in children 6\u201312 months old, and decreased with age [1\u20138]. AOM is also among the leading causes for children\u2019s visits to physicians and is the most common reason for prescription of antibiotics to children with respiratory conditions [9]. Moreover, otitis media with effusion (OME) can occur as a post-inflammatory response to AOM. The effusion in the middle ear could decrease sound transmission, resulting in conductive hearing loss [10]. Tympanostomy tube insertions are recommended for children with bilateral chronic OME (OME lasting for 3 months or longer) and recurrent AOM with middle ear effusion [11]. The resulting psychological burden on parents and substantial economic costs also demonstrate that AOM is a major public health concern [12].",

In the current study, using the Taiwan NHIRD, we estimated the secular trends of childhood otitis media before and after the introduction of TIV. The introduction of TIV into the Taiwan childhood immunization program was associated with a significant decline in the incidence of outpatient visits for AOM in the influenza seasons. As is typical of AOM, in the pre-TIV era (2000\u20132003), children < 2 years had the highest incidence of AOM in the influenza season (98.4 episodes/1000 person-seasons). After the introduction of TIV in 2004\u20132006, the incidence of outpatient visits with AOM declined significantly (66.1 episodes/1000 person-seasons) in < 2-year-olds, who were enrolled in the free influenza vaccination program launched by the Taiwan CDC. With the increased vaccine coverage rate,19 the incidence of outpatient visits for AOM declined correspondingly. In addition of the direct protection provided by the vaccination, we believe that TIV may have induced some herd immunity that further contributed to the reduction in influenza attack rates and the rates of associated AOM in that age group. Compared to the older children who had not received the influenza vaccination, the seasonal AOM incidence increased significantly. Better parental awareness of clinical signs of AOM, increased healthcare quality and accessibility, and better accuracy in the diagnosis of AOM are all considered responsible for this phenomenon.",

            "text": "The pathogenesis of AOM has been studied thoroughly over the previous decades. AOM is strongly seasonal. The incidence of AOM is highest during the fall and winter months and lowest during the spring and summer months, which parallels the incidence of viral URI [24]. Respiratory viruses, such as the influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, and rhinovirus, have been isolated from middle ear effusions [13\u201315]. AOM is commonly caused by bacterial pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, either directly or as a complication of a viral URI [25]. Influenza and pneumococcal vaccines are two important commercially available vaccines. In the past three decades, the concept of \u201cprevention is better than cure\u201d has become increasingly popular in the battle between infectious organisms and the human immune system. The efficacy of PCV in preventing AOM has been observed in several studies [20, 26], but the efficacy of influenza vaccines in preventing AOM or tympanostomy tube insertion has not been well studied. In Taiwan, PCV-7 has been available primarily at the recipients\u2019 expense since October 2005 and the cumulative coverage rates for PCV-7 among children < 5 years old in 2005 and 2006 were only 0.7% and 8.6%, respectively [18]. Thus, in the present study, we could evaluate the efficacy of TIV in preventing AOM with limited confounding due to PCVs.",

            "text": "Several studies have addressed the efficacy of TIV in preventing AOM. TIV was found to have a positive effect on AOM by Heikkinen et al. and Clements et al [27, 28]. Both these studies were conducted in day-care centers, with only 187 and 186 children enrolled, respectively. However, Hoberman et al. conducted a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-year clinical trial in 786 children, aged 6\u201324 months, including 411 children in the first year and 375 in the second year [29]. The investigators did not identify any significant reduction in the burden of AOM after administration of the TIV. The inconsistent results of these studies may be due to the relatively small sample size and short-term follow-up. In the current study, data from 803,592 children over the period October 2000 through March 2007 were analyzed, and outpatient visits in seven consecutive influenza seasons were studied. The secular trends in AOM incidence were followed before and after the introduction of TIV. This study provided additional evidence of the efficacy of TIV against AOM. The Taiwan CDC has gradually expanded the free influenza vaccination program in recent years. The long-term trends in all clinical manifestations of influenza disease and related complications should be monitored continuously.",

Aspiration of the middle ear fluid in children with AOM, either for microbiology cultures or symptomatic relief, is not part of routine medical care in Taiwan. In addition, laboratory data and culture results are not available in the NHIRD. Second, the patients\u2019 vaccination histories are not comprehensively recorded in the NHIRD. In Taiwan, the free influenza vaccination is not included in the regular childhood immunization schedule, and parents may decide not to have the influenza vaccination administered if they have any concerns. Thus, we were unable to ascertain the immunization status in our study subjects. Third, several risk factors predisposing to AOM have been reported; these include age, socioeconomic status, tobacco smoke exposure, lack of breast-feeding, siblings, and day-care attendance [30]. However, most of this information is not disclosed in the NHIRD; therefore, we could not investigate whether some children have risk factors predisposing to AOM. Finally, as with all studies analyzing large administrative databases, there is potential for misclassification bias when using diagnostic codes to define AOM. However, such biases are unlikely to affect trends over time and the reduction of AOM cases in the < 2-years-old population in influenza seasons since 2004 can most likely be attributed to TIV introduction.",
