More than 20 TLRs clustered in six subfamilies have been identified in more than a dozen of fish species [5\u20137] (Figure 1). They provide a wide spectrum for recognizing the plethora of aquatic pathogens. Upon ligand binding, TLRs dimerize and undergo conformational changes to recruit the Myddosome to the activated toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain (TIR) [8]. In mammals, this helical structure consists of six MYD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88) adaptor molecules, onto which a layer of four IRAK4 (interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4) serine/threonine kinases and another layer of four IRAK2 or IRAK1 factors are assembled [8]. The composition of teleost Myddosome is unknown so far, although functional interaction of the complex Myd88-IRAK4a with the TIR domain has been reported [9]. However, no IRAK2 factor has yet been found in any teleostean fish species [5, 6].",

This TLR-MYD88-IRAK-TRAF6 signaling pathway is well conserved, not only in vertebrates but also in Drosophila [11, 12].

            "text": "The Gram-negative bacterium Aeromonas salmonicida ssp. salmonicida is the causative agent of furunculosis, a serious disease of salmonid fish inducing high mortality even after a low-dose intraperitoneal injection [13]. Pathogenic challenges induce not only the massive activation of proinflammatory mediators [14\u201317], but also enhanced transcription of tlr-encoding genes in fish [18\u201320] as reported previously for mammals [21\u201323]. The dominant MAMP from Gram-negative bacteria is lipopolysaccharide (LPS), known in mammals to be specifically and solely recognized by TLR4 [24]. No TLR4 ortholog has been identified so far in salmonid fish, and LPS recognition in bony fish is unclear to date [6, 25, 26]. Moreover, modulation of the expression pattern of the entire TLR panel in response to A. salmonicida has not been reported from rainbow trout. We therefore profiled the expression of 13 tlrs belonging to five subfamilies of these receptors (Figure 1) in immune tissues (spleen, head kidney, liver, and thymus) from healthy and A. salmonicida-infected rainbow trout. Moreover, we also included other genes encoding downstream factors of TLR signaling into analysis, that is, the TLR adapter myd88 [27]; the key kinases irak4a [9] and irak1; the NF-\u03baB-activating factor traf6; and the inhibitor of TLR signaling, tollip [28]. This panel of candidate factors should provide a comprehensive overview of the transcriptional regulation of TLR signaling in trout during A. salmonicida infection.",

The relative proportion of myeloid (44%) and lymphoid cells (55%) was quite balanced in control trout (Figure 5(c)). The A. salmonicida infection changed the situation tremendously. Myeloid cells constituted more than 80% of the peritoneal cells already at 6 hpi, whereas lymphoid cells accounted for only 18%. This ratio remained almost constant until 72 hpi.

The unique and quick sixfold upregulation of tlr22a2 already 6 hpi in head kidney would highlight this TLR as a candidate for specifically contributing to A. salmonicida recognition. Yet, attributing that specific role to this factor is highly unlikely since the expression of the fish-specific tlr22 is known to be modulated by a variety of apparently unrelated signals. It was significantly upregulated in several tissues and immune cells after infection and/or stimulation (i) with Gram-negative bacteria, that is, Aeromonas sp. in trout [47], in goldfish Carassius auratus [48], and in rohu Labeo rohita [49], as well as with Vibrio anguillarum in sea bream Sparus aurata [50]; (ii) with Gram-positive Mycobacterium chelonae in C. auratus [48]; (iii) with reovirus in grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella [51, 52]; and (vi) with the ectoparasite Argulus siamensis in common carp Cyprinus carpio [53]. The broad spectrum of apparent \u201cligands\u201d for this factor suggests that its interaction with MAMPs can structurally not be similar to the sophisticated key-lock principal as known from mammalian TLRs interacting with their specific ligands [54, 55]. Perhaps trout Tlr22a2 senses some endogenous DAMPs resulting from Aeromonas-induced traumata rather than exogenous MAMPs as previously discussed by Ingerslev et al. [14]. However, assuming ligand-independent activation of Tlr22a2 expression is even more puzzling since we noted in our original description of the twin receptors Tlr22a1 and Tlr22a2 [47] that both factors share a high degree of identical amino acid residues (94%), with most of the few exchanged residues being located in the N-terminal, distal leucine-rich repeat region (LRR). LRRs are known as ligand-binding areas of TLRs. We also note that the expression of both Tlr22a twin factors is not coregulated since only one of them was upregulated.",

Upregulated mRNA concentrations of such factors in liver were reported from a variety of challenge studies and infection experiments in different fish species [56\u201359]. Irak1 was distinct from all those other factors in so far as its mRNA abundance was increased already at 6 hpi, not only in liver, but also in spleen and head kidney. Early stimulation of the expression of this factor in several immune organs connects its activation to the very early events of mounting an immune defense. A prominent function of IRAK1 in mammals is its integration into the Myddosome, which is built up around the activated TIR domain of TLRs [8]. Viral infection of the grass carp was demonstrated to recruit Irak1 to the cell membrane possibly indicating that it is recruited to transmembrane TLRs [58]. Relating this information with our data could suggest that rate-limiting low levels of irak1 factors might constrain TLR signaling in healthy trout and its organs. Given the absence of strong transcriptional tlr regulation in trout, this would conceptually allow shifting the regulatory level of the TLR signaling cascade away from the transcriptional regulation of some key receptors (such as TLR2 and TLR4 in mammals) towards the expression level of rate-limiting downstream factors.",

This almost instantaneous reaction against the invaders was in stark contrast to the sluggish modulation of the expression of factors contributing to the TLR signaling cascade. Recognizing the presence of pathogens by the host activated vibrantly the immune defense. The first step consisted of mounting a massive cellular defense to fight off the bacteria rather than inducing resilience or tolerance. Those myeloid cells (conceivably monocytes/macrophages and granulocytes), having been recruited into the peritoneum, belong to the cellular arm of innate immune defense. The second step of harnessing cellular immune mechanisms consisted of activating lymphoid cells, which belong to the adaptive branch of immune defense. The activation of adaptive immunity involves time-consuming processes such as induction of cell proliferation and cellular redifferentiation. Only then, significant amounts of cells might start migrating out from their site of proliferation and maturation to the site of infection. Our RT-qPCR data suggest belated onset of adaptive immunity, which was not surprising. It took more than 12 hpi for a considerable amount of the cells of the B-type lineage to probably move out from their reservoir in the head kidney [61] into the peritoneum. At the same time, the T lymphocytes presumably started moving into this organ, conceivably to be functionally primed by relevant antigen-presenting cells.",

We suggest that the limited abundance of Irak1 constrains their activity. No specific TLR could be singled out as a dominant receptor for perceiving the presence of A. salmonicida, albeit that Tlr22a2 was quickly and strongly induced after infection. Rather, this factor is known to be regulated by several nonrelated stimuli and might serve as unspecific alarm switch.

Notably, a Tlr4 ortholog is absent in salmonid fish (marked with a flash). The Myddosome consisting of Myd88, Irak4a, and Irak1 (inside the green box) binds to the activated Tlr and recruits Traf6 and further downstream factors (indicated with a broken arrow), which in turn activate NF-\u03baB.
