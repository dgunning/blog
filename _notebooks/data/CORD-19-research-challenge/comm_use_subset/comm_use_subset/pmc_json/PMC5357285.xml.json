The legal global trade in wildlife and wildlife products involves the movement of billions of plants and animals comprising an economic value estimated at US $300 billion per annum (Ahlenius 2008; WWF/Dalberg 2012). The illegal aspect of wildlife trade is estimated to be a $5\u201320 billion-dollar industry, comparable to the international trade of narcotics and weapons (Wyler and Sheikh 2008; Haken 2011; WWF/Dalberg 2012). There are no adequate estimates of the full scale of wildlife traded throughout the world given its diversity, scope and partial underground existence. Uncertainty surrounding this issue is enhanced by lack of international data standards and varying commitments to data collection infrastructure within and between countries.",

Confiscated illegal trade is often reported but undetected illegal shipments regularly go unrecorded.

This database therefore holds records of all declared wildlife imports to the USA and, theoretically, details of illegal imports confiscated by authorities at US ports of entry. Although some wildlife species are regulated by other US agencies such as the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Food and Drug Administration (FDA), imports of wildlife as defined by USFWS are also tracked in LEMIS despite this overlap in jurisdiction. Therefore, the LEMIS system represents a comprehensive data source for incoming wildlife to the USA (with few exceptions such as bushmeat items that are not determined to be of CITES origin).

Over 200 species of imported fish have resulted in introductions to the wild in the USA with nearly half establishing breeding populations at least for some time (Smith et al. 2008). Beyond the environmental impacts, translocation of such live wildlife has resulted in pathogen pollution (the introduction of viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites into new environments) with consequences to native wildlife health and US fisheries, for example (Springborn et al. 2015).",

This finding is in alignment with our review of the WILDb database from 2000 to 2013. However, this percentage is based on assessment of refused shipments in the LEMIS database and therefore does not take into account smuggled shipments not detected; detected by Department of Homeland Security Customs and Border Protection (DHS CBP) but not reported to USFWS; detected by USFWS but not entered into LEMIS after the fact; or detected by CBP but reported only to another regulating agency of the same item such as the CDC, USDA or FDA. As previously noted, the USFWS LEMIS database is mainly a reflection of approved or rejected wildlife imports that are declared to USFWS by the importer and that non-declared (and thus illegal) imports that are successfully detected are done so through the DHS CBP. These confiscations should be reported to USFWS and entered into LEMIS; however, confiscation data housed in CBP databases are not readily available to the public in a significant level of detail for comparison. Thus, the amount of illegally imported wildlife is more than likely an underestimate.",

Further, codes often overlapped and/or several different codes were used to describe a single species. Currently, WILDb contains 14,074 unique species codes. EHA was able to ascertain some level of taxonomic information for over 98% of the data entries despite the fact that the majority of these did not provide specific species identification. This study was further limited to wildlife imports that were either accepted or rejected by authorities and did not include illegal shipments that evaded authorities as those go inherently unrecorded and unrecognized.",

The USFWS currently does not focus primarily on disease prevention, but on conservation status; the CDC currently focuses on specific health risks associated with non-human primates, African rodents and bats; and the USDA regulates non-domestic hoofstock, birds and few other specific mammals that originate in countries positive for reportable diseases.

However, it is clear that the USA is a global leader in legal and illegal wildlife consumption. The demand for wild animals for use as companion animals/pets has been responsible for the majority of the live animal trade in the Western Hemisphere. This market involves billions of individual live animals, ranging from invertebrates and corals to non-human primates, originating from all over the globe. The demand for trophies, fashion, traditional medicines and exotic foods are some of the main drivers of the importation of wildlife products. The import process provides an opportunity to reinforce \u201ccritical control points\u201d prior to entry through US borders.

Thus, there should be an emphasis within the US Government and wildlife disease communities on filling gaps in the data for high priority pathways in order to better characterize risk. Specifically, threats posed by (1) large volumes of live aquatic species, (2) wild animal host species not currently regulated (e.g., some rodents) and (3) species closely related to domestic agriculture (e.g., hoofstock/camels) that may enter the USA for multiple purposes were prioritized by this working group for further assessment.",
