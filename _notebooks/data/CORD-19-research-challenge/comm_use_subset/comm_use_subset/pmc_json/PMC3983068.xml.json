Recent epidemics of concern include: SARS [1], influenza [2]\u2013[4], H7N9 [5], [6] and MERS [7], [8]. During an epidemic it is important to accurately predict the impact of the epidemic over different spatial scales, where scale refers to the size of the region being monitored; such as a hospital, city, country or globally. Intervention policies should be defined relative to this spatial scale, for example taking account of how long it will take to vaccinate a whole city or to distribute a treatment country-wide. Those making decisions about intervention strategies need a clear understanding of the underlying epidemic process, so as to anticipate the magnitude and timing of peak incidence at their scale of interest and to effectively control the epidemic.",

For example: influenza [9]\u2013[11], measles [12]\u2013[14], and smallpox [15], [16] have all been represented by spatially explicit epidemic models. All of these examples can be thought of as metapopulation models in which the population of interest is represented as a collection of sub-populations located in space, for example households [17]\u2013[19], airports (GLEaM [20]) or districts/states [21]. The advantages of these models are that they can capture complicated mobility and mixing patterns and heterogeneous population density, without the complexity of an individual-based model. Also, model output can be easily reported for specific populations, such as counties or cities.",

Both of these are defined according to the resolution of the population representation, where resolution defines the number and size of the pixels making up the \u201cimage\u201d of the population within the model. A pixel is the smallest single component of an image. A high resolution representation will divide the region into many small pixels; a lower resolution uses fewer, larger pixels (Fig. S1). The resolution chosen is usually decided by the data available: for example, population and travel data may be defined at the ward or county level only. The level of mixing between individuals in distinct pixels is defined by mobility models, these are often fitted to travel data from censuses. Also, sometimes, resolution is limited by computational capacity.",

A kernel defines the relative probability of travelling between two pixels. The offset power function is an adaptation of the gravity model. The gravity model states that an individual's probability of mixing in a pixel different to their home pixel is inversely proportional to the distance apart of the pixels, to some power. The offset power function adds in an offset distance parameter, which means that pixels closer together than this distance mix fully.

The highest mobility kernel is in line with kernels fitted to commuter data in the UK and US [9]. However, our review of data on travel patterns found that only 15% of an average individual's journeys are commuting, making up just 19% of the total distance an average individual travels each year [22] (Table S1). Commuting data also excludes key at-risk groups \u2013 the under 17 s and over 70 s \u2013 who have lower mobility travel patterns compared to the 18\u201369 population [22]. Therefore, we explored more restrictive kernels than those estimated using commuting data to reflect shorter distances travelled and lower frequency travel in the most at-risk populations and the regular non-commuting travel of the wider population.",

Because  was constant, if the mobility was such that there was contact between every pair of pixels, the final epidemic size was the same across all resolutions and in every pixel. If mobility was restrictive enough that some pixels were never infected the final CAR reflected this restriction. The full proof that attack rates were constant with respect to resolution is in the Text S2 in Supporting Information S1, and is similar to those in Refs [24], [25].",

However, at the fundamental resolution and above, consistent estimates of the peak attack rate were obtained (Fig. 1H). This was increasingly evident as mobility became more and more restricted: for the most localised mobility assumptions (low power), peak incidence in the fully mixed case was nearly double that at the highest resolution.

In Guangzhou, Rio and New York, changing the spatial resolution had a significant effect on the peak incidence when mobility was at a low to medium level, though the effect was less clear in Delhi (Fig. 2B\u2013E). The Delhi region had the largest total population size and the highest mean population density of all regions we considered (Table S2 and Fig. S3). Therefore, even at low mobility the numbers mixing will be relatively high, meaning that the disease spread will not be as restricted as it would be in a less densely populated region.",

We varied the kernel parameters: the power, , between \u22126 and \u22122 (as discussed earlier, this selection gave a wide range of mobility levels) and the saturation distance between 1 and 10 km, choosing from a log scale (so smaller distances are more likely). We tested 50 parameter sets chosen using the LHS technique [27], with 10 separate realisations of each set for each region (variation in results from the stochastic model was low - see confidence intervals for 25 repeats in Fig. 2 for example). Kernels for the 50 sets are plotted in Fig. S4. The LHS results confirmed that the effect of resolution is most important in populations which are less mobile, Fig. 3. As mobility decreased (a combination of the offset and the power in the kernel) the difference in peak incidence between the lowest and the highest resolution increased. This was particularly true in Guangzhou, Rio and New York, but in Delhi the effect was reduced (due to Delhi having a very large population in comparison to the other regions).",

However, we calculated the actual number of individuals moving between pixels (the flux) and found the radiation model flux to be very close to the offset gravity model of medium mobility, particularly at the highest resolution, Fig. 4. Indeed the radiation model is always bounded by the three gravity models we use and our LHS models explore a large space around these. More generally, gravity-like models have been implemented with a number of different normalisation assumptions, some of which produce population flux patterns very similar to the radiation model [15], [17].",

Indeed at low mobility, clear thresholds existed for the resolution of the theoretical population density, such that models with resolutions below the threshold over-estimated the system-wide peak incidence. Similar thresholds existed for real population densities: Guangzhou, Rio, New York and Delhi. Increased mobility reduced the effect of resolution on the epidemic.",
