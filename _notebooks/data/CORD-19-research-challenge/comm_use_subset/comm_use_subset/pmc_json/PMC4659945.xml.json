            "text": "The Mononegavirales order groups five families of monopartite, negative-strand RNA viruses many of which are highly pathogenic and/or contagious; the Filoviridae (of which Ebola virus is a representative), the Bornaviridae (Borna disease virus), the Nyamiviridae (midway virus), the Rhabdoviridae (rabies, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)) and the Paramyxoviridae (measles virus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV)). These viruses encode a large RNA polymerase (L) (usually >2,000 amino acids) that is crucial to viral replication (Fig. 1a). It has two distinct roles to replicate the RNA genome and to transcribe viral mRNA. As such it not only polymerizes RNA but also synthesizes fully methylated cap structures1. Capping involves the co-transcriptional addition of a guanosine (G) to the first nucleotide (N1) of the nascent RNA chain via a 5\u2032-5\u2032 triphosphate bridge, resulting in a GpppN1- structure. Typically, this is followed by methylation of nitrogen 7 (N7) of G, giving rise to mGpppN1-, and of the 2\u2032-oxygen (2\u2032O) of the N1 ribose (mGpppN1m-). The cap protects mRNAs against 5\u2032-exonucleases and promotes RNA transport and translation, while 2\u2032O-methylation prevents detection by cellular-immunity sensors2,3,4. In Rhabdoviridae, CR-V catalyses cap addition by means of an unconventional polyribonucleotydyl-transferase (PRNTase) reaction where a conserved histidine in CR-V forms a covalent phosphoamide bond with the transcript, resulting in a CR-V-pRNA intermediate. The capped transcript is released after ligation of a Gpp to the pRNA. This mechanism differs from capping in eukaryotes and most other viruses, in which a guanylyltransferase (GTase) forms a phosphoamide bond with Gp, before transferring it to 5\u2032ppRNA2. Paramyxoviridae also contain a PRNTase signature motif in their CR-V domains, suggesting they use the same capping strategy as Rhabdoviridae. In addition, however, paramyxovirus and filovirus L proteins contain a KxxxKxxG sequence (K-K-G motif) at their C termini, reminiscent of a signature motif for eukaryotic GTases, where one of the lysines forms the transient phosphoamide bond with Gp in the capping reaction5. A C-terminal domain of Rinderpest virus L (containing CR-VI and the downstream K-K-G motif) was shown to form such a bond6, leaving open the possibility that Paramyxoviridae use GTase activity for capping.",

In 2\u2032O-MTases, a conserved K-D-K-E tetrad potentiates methyl transfer2. As yet, the boundaries of CR-VI, the putative MTase of L, are not well defined, nor is it clear if CR-VI acts on its own or in conjunction with other domains, whether it mediates both N7- and 2\u2032O-methylation and which of these methylations would take place first. Research into the activities of L and the mechanisms underpinning them has historically been hampered by a complete, order-wide absence of high-resolution structures. To redress this, we set out to study L domains of hMPV, a paramyxovirus of the Pneumovirinae subfamily closely related to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Like RSV, hMPV is highly contagious and causes respiratory tract disease7. As a part of this study, we expressed CR-VI+, a 406-residue fragment comprising CR-VI and the adjoining \u2018+ domain\u2019, the variable region carrying the K-K-G-motif, investigated its MTase activity and solved its crystal structure. Besides sequentially methylating the 2\u2032O and N7 atoms of small capped RNAs, CR-VI+ also 2\u2032O methylates uncapped substrates and displays nucleotide triphosphatase (NTPase) activity. Both the CR-VI domain, which assumes a fairly standard MTase fold, and the K-K-G motif of the (mainly helical) +domain are required for the MTase reactions. Combined, the data provide new insights into the modification of the 5\u2032-ends of transcripts emerging from the polymerase domain of L. This structural information on a mononegavirus L protein, and the new insights in the capping mechanism it provides, should spur the development of novel antiviral drugs against this important group of highly pathogenic viruses.\n",

            "text": "In vitro, CR-VI+ most effectively binds and methylates synthetic RNAs containing the conserved start sequence of hMPV transcripts, preferring a substrate length of nine nucleotides (Fig. 2). The methylation occurs at the G\nN7 and N1-2\u2032O positions (Figs 2 and 3a), with 2\u2032O-methylation preceding N7-methylation (Fig. 3a), an uncommon order of events also occurring in VSV8. CR-VI+, moreover, efficiently methylates uncapped RNAs with 5\u2032-phosphate groups (especially pppRNA), primarily at the 2\u2032O atom of N1 since almost no 3H-methyl transfer takes place onto the pppGmGGACAAGU substrate where this atom is blocked (Fig. 2b, green bars). The 2\u2032O-methylation of pppGGGACAAGU represents \u223c50% of that observed with GpppGGGACAAGU (which has an extra methylation target in the G\nN7 atom; Fig. 2b, red bars). Mutagenesis studies show that all K-D-K-E residues (K1673, D1779, K1817 and E1848) are essential for 2\u2032O-methylation, while the aspartic acid (D1779) in particular is important for N7-methylation (Fig. 3b), as was also observed in Flaviviridae MTases9. Other residues, many of which belong to the +domain rather than the core MTase fold, were also found to be essential for the MTase activities (the \u2018SUBP\u2019 residues in Fig. 3b, described below).",

There are no significant differences between the molecules, which have a slightly twisted, bi-lobed shape, composed of two globular domains, the larger corresponding to CR-VI (residues \u223c1,616\u20131,883) and the smaller to the +domain (1,884\u20132,005; Fig. 1b). Although composed of only \u223c120 residues in Pneumovirinae, the size of the +domain varies greatly within the Mononegavirales order, reaching \u223c240 residues in Rhabdoviridae. In hMPV, it consists of six \u03b1-helices (\u03b1+1\u20136). Helix \u03b1+6 contains the K-K-G motif (Supplementary Fig. 2) and together with \u03b1+1 leans over the active cleft of CR-VI. Helix \u03b1+4, and to a lesser extent helices \u03b1+1, \u03b1+5 and \u03b1+6, packs down on \u03bb1650\u20131666, the second half of a long loop (residues 1,635\u20131,666) that swerves around the CR-VI domain (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 3; \u2018\u03bb\u2019 is used throughout the paper to denote loops). The \u03bb1650\u20131666 region, which contains a small helix (\u03b1-a), acts as a fulcrum allowing the +domain to pivot relative to the CR-VI domain. Helix \u03b1+3 varies in length, from 4\u00bd turns (in most crystals) to 6 (in Protein Data Bank (PDB) 4UCY), and the loop between \u03b1+2 and \u03b1+3 is always disordered (Supplementary Fig. 3). In crystals of the monomeric C1877A mutant (space group P3121), this disordered, unstable region is further enlarged, as helix \u03b1+2 completely unfolds and \u03b1+3 unwinds to 3\u00bd turns.",

In its active core, however, it better resembles RrmJ-type flavivirus MTases (for example, 3EVF9; Supplementary Fig. 4). Most notably, hMPV and flaviviruses share an unusually long (\u223c10 residues), flexible \u03b22\u03bb (that is, the loop immediately following the \u03b22-strand), which forms the SAM-binding pocket (SAMP) along with loops \u03b21\u03bb and \u03b24\u03bb, shielding it from the solvent (Fig. 1b, c). In Wesselsbron (flavi-)virus, \u03b22\u03bb is found in closed or open conformations, either packing up against SAM (PDB: 3ELW) or exposing it to the solvent (3EMB)13, changes that may assist SAM uptake and/or SAH expulsion. In CR-VI+, \u03b22\u03bb similarly assumes alternate conformations (Fig. 4c,d). In the \u2018closed\u2019 form, the ligand\u2019s ribose group is hydrogen bonded to D1725, and\u2014via a water\u2014to D1722. Loops \u03b21\u03bb and \u03b24\u03bb also show a degree of flexibility. \u03b21\u03bb residue E1697, conserved in paramyxo- and filoviruses, forms a hydrogen bond with the NH2 group of SAM and is essential for both MTase activities (Fig. 3b). However, in the absence of SAM, its side chain either moves into the sub-pocket that normally accommodates the NH2 group, or, more markedly, turns towards the solvent in the direction of \u03b22\u03bb, which in this case assumes the \u2018open\u2019 position (Fig. 4d). \u03b24\u03bb forms a side wall of SAMP, and together with \u03b1D and \u03b25 also defines a deep, hydrophobic cavity not present in other MTases, termed NSP (or nucleoside-binding pocket). Although a role for NSP has yet to be determined, the pocket binds the adenosine moiety of SAM or ATP, soaked at high (25 mM) concentrations into CR-VI+ crystals, causing \u03b24\u03bb to impinge onto SAMP (Fig. 4c,d; when SAM is used for soaking, one SAM molecule occupies SAMP, and another binds to NSP). GTP was not observed in NSP, but this may reflect a lower soaking concentration (2.5 mM), due to GTP\u2019s poor solubility. With the exception of E1781, the amino acids lining NSP are poorly conserved beyond the Pneumovirinae, and mutating key NSP residues barely affects the MTase activities (Fig. 3b). CR-VI, finally, contains a Zn-finger, which is not conserved beyond the Pneumovirinae subfamily and links the small \u03b1\u2013d\u2032 to the rest of the structure (Fig. 1b).",

In CR-VI+, however, an open, solvent-exposed area is found where this pocket is normally located (Fig. 6a). Moreover, GpppG- or mGpppG binding was not observed in co-crystallization or soaking experiments, suggesting that CR-VI+ has a weak affinity for G at best and that the cap is not required for substrate recognition. This is consistent with CR-VI+ binding capped and uncapped RNAs with similar strength and being able to 2\u2032O-methylate uncapped RNAs (Fig. 2b). Strong binding would also prevent translocation of G into SUBP for N7-methylation. Although a high-affinity cap-binding site is clearly absent from CR-VI+, the low-affinity nucleoside binding to NSP and the convenient location of this pocket relative to SUBP suggest it could provide space for G without forming strong interactions (Supplementary Fig. 5).",

            "text": "The absence of a high-affinity cap-binding pocket appears partly compensated for by the narrowing of the groove that in related MTases accommodates the first few nucleotides of the transcripts, by the overhanging +domain (Figs 4 and 6a). In particular, the site adjoining SAMP, which holds the nucleotides undergoing methylation, has become a more elaborate, but narrower and possibly therefore, higher-affinity substrate-binding pocket (termed SUBP as it accommodates the nucleotide undergoing methylation). Consistently, electron density is found in SUBP following soaking or co-crystallization with GTP, whereas in other MTases added GTP predominantly shows up in the cap-binding pocket. In particular, helix \u03b1+6 and the +domain-affiliated \u03bb1650\u20131666 help shape SUBP through the side chains of K1991 and K1995 (of the K-K-G motif), and of H1659 and R1662, respectively (Fig. 4b). The marked decrease in MTase activity of mutants altered at these residues (Fig. 3b) illustrates the importance of SUBP in correctly presenting the substrate nucleotides to SAM. Nevertheless, the pocket is too spacious for a single nucleotide, and the electron density in SUBP from a number of soaked crystals suggests that bound GTP often assumes more than one orientation. In structures where GTP could be fitted with confidence, the guanosine moiety predominantly interacts with \u03bb1650\u20131666 residues H1659 and R1662, and with K1991 and (K-D-K-E residue) K1673, which clamp the guanine (Fig. 4b). Unusually for cap-MTases, K1673 is not part of \u03b1Z, but instead resides on the small z\u2032 (310)-helix (Fig. 1b,c). Whether any of the observed positions of GTP reflects in vivo binding of N1 (as part of a transcript) is unclear; in MTase\u2013RNA complexes (PDB: 1AV6 (ref. 17), 4N49 (ref. 16)), N1 is situated much closer to the K-D-K-E tetrad (Fig. 6a).",

The reaction observed with CR-VI+, however, is quite slow, possibly because other parts of L, or other co-factors, are needed for full activity. In line with this, we were not able to identify key active-site residues. Using the mutants listed in Fig. 3b, the greatest reductions in GTPase activity were obtained with E1697C (corresponding to the flexible residue at the bottom of SAMP; Fig. 4d) and S1669A (part of SUBP, Fig. 4b) to 54 (\u00b120) and 57 (\u00b116) % of the wild-type activity, respectively (n=3).

            "text": "As a GDP is transferred onto a PRNTase-bound pRNA intermediate during cap synthesis in VSV21, the presence of NTPase activity in CR-VI+ would suggest that this domain is involved in cap addition. It is unclear from the structure of VSV L how capping, cap methylation and RNA synthesis are coordinated14, but an involvement of CR-VI+ in cap addition is consistent with the dynamic nature of the multi-domain polymerases of RNA viruses in general, exemplified by flu where the C-terminal two-thirds of PB2 has been shown to be extremely mobile22,23. The presentation of uncapped (but CR-V-linked) pRNA to CR-VI+ would also explain why hMPV L does not require a high-affinity cap-binding site. The integrity of both the PRNTase and K-K-G motifs, moreover, has been shown to be essential for viable mRNA synthesis in human parainfluenzavirus 2 (hPIV-2)5, in line with capping involving a concerted action of CR-V and CR-VI+. Assuming the transcript is presented to CR-VI+ by the PRNTase, 2\u2032O-methylation may actually occur before the cap is added (as a cap is not required for the reaction; Fig. 2b), which would also be consistent with 2\u2032O-methylation preceding N7-methylation. The possibility that 2\u2032O-methylation precedes cap addition was also suggested by the ability of virions of the rhabdovirus spring viremia of carp virus to synthesize uncapped, N1-methylated oligonucleotides24. We did not observe significant methylation of free GTP by CR-VI+ (levels were <5% of that of GpppGGGACAAGU methylation), suggesting G\nN7-methylation takes place after G is added to the RNA. In addition 2\u2032O-methylated substrates (GpppGmGGACAAGU and pppGmGGACAAGU) show an \u223c2-fold higher affinity for CR-VI+, compared with their unmethylated counterparts (Fig. 2b), which presumably reflects an RNA repositioning mechanism allowing the G\nN7 atom access to the SAM methyl donor in the second methylation step.",

Boundaries of CR-I to -V are approximate. CR-III contains the G-D-N-Q signature motif for polymerase (RdRP) activity, and CR-V contains the HR motif for PRNTase activity. (b) Cartoon representation of the CR-VI+ crystal structure, from amino (N) to carboxy (C) terminus (no structure could be assigned to the first \u223c18 residues). The +domain is shown in red, with K1991 and K1995 of the K-K-G motif in stick format. The CR-VI (MTase) domain is coloured purple (\u03b2-strands) and green (helices and loops), except for \u03b21\u03bb, \u03b22\u03bb and \u03b24\u03bb (the loop regions C terminal of \u03b2-strands 1, 2 and 4 that form SAMP; orange), and \u03bb1650\u20131666 (which disengages itself from the main CR-VI-fold to interact with the +domain; yellow). Nomenclature of helices and strands follows that used for other MTases (c). The pale-blue sticks show the K-D-K-E motif. A Zn-ion (silver sphere) is co-ordinated by H1766, H1798, C1802 and C1805. (c) Schematic representation of the secondary structure of a prototypical SAM-dependent MTase (top) and of the hMPV CR-VI domain (bottom).

CR-VI displays some deviations from the prototypical SAM-MTase fold, some of which it shares with other RNA-MTases, including the long N-terminal coil, a longer \u03b1D and an extra helix (\u03b1X) at the C terminus. \u03b1E is absent, whereas, atypical for viral MTases, \u03b1B is fully formed. CR-VI, moreover, has an unusual \u03b2-sheet; it lacks \u03b23, but this is compensated for by the addition, at the other end of the sheet, of a new strand (\u03b20), which glues the start of the N-terminal coil to the main structure.

The transfer of tritiated methyl groups from SAM molecules to a capped RNA substrate (GpppGGGACAAGU), containing the consensus start sequence of hMPV transcripts (in red), was monitored over time. The rather slow in vitro methylation suggests the reaction is impaired compared with the in vivo activity of intact L, regions of which may aid the methyl transfer (for example, by correctly positioning substrate RNAs to the MTase; see main text). The bars and error bars correspond to the mean values from three independent measurements and their s.d.\u2019s, respectively. (b). Substrate specificity was determined as above, but using various synthetic RNA substrates, and allowing the reactions to proceed for 16 h. Substrates were compared with GpppGGGACAAGU (red and blue panels) and pppGGGACAAGU (green panel), for which the degree of methylation was set at 100% (#, marked bars). The red-shaded panel compares the degree of methylation of nine-nucleotide-long hMPV start sequences with different 5\u2032-ends and methylation states (the lighter bars represent uncapped RNAs). The results indicate efficient methylation of RNAs that already carried a (cold) methyl group, either at their N7-guanine or 2\u2032O-ribose position (confirming the occurrence of 2\u2032O- and N7-methylation, respectively), and of uncapped RNAs (especially pppRNA). The pppRNA substrate is predominantly methylated at N1, as substrates that were methylated beforehand at this nucleotide do not undergo substantial additional methylation (green panel). CR-VI+ prefers the hMPV start sequence over the short GpppACCCC sequence, and over RNA-start sequences of Dengue virus and SARS coronavirus, irrespective of their lengths (blue panel). A nine-nucleotide hMPV substrate, however, is much preferred over one with only five nucleotides, indicating that additional interactions take place between the protein and nucleotides 6\u20139. Consistently a 10-times lower KD (dissociation constant) characterizes the interaction of CR-VI+ with the 9-mer, compared with that with the 5-mer. The KDs, measured in triplicate using a dot-blot assay and listed at the right of the diagram (\u00b1s.d.\u2019s), also show that capped and uncapped hMPV sequences are bound with comparable affinities, and that 2\u2032O-methylated substrates are preferred over unmethylated ones.",

Following CR-VI+-mediated methyl transfer from SAM onto GpppGGGACAAGU (in which G was [32P]-labelled), nucleotides 2\u20139 were removed by nuclease P1 digestion, and the caps were separated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The controls (GpppG, GpppGm, mGpppG and mGpppGm, from left to right) were obtained with the same substrate, using MTases that specifically methylate caps at the N7 or 2\u2032O positions (human N7- and vaccinia virus 2\u2032O-MTase). The TLC experiment used 0.65 M LiCl as mobile phase, allowing a clear separation of mGpppG and mGpppGm (top). The caps on the TLC plate were subsequently further resolved, this time using 0.45 M (NH2)2SO4 as mobile phase for a better separation of GpppG and GpppGm (bottom). GpppGm appears first (after a 1-h incubation), mGpppGm becomes prominent at a later stage, and mGpppG was not observed, indicating that 2\u2032O-methylation of N1 precedes N7-methylation of G. (b). The effect of point mutations on the MTase activities of CR-VI+, measured after a 16-h incubation period (by means of a filter-binding assay, as in Fig. 2), using GpppGGGACAAGU substrates that were methylated beforehand at N7 of G or 2\u2032O of N1, to specifically monitor 2\u2032O or N7-MTase activities, respectively. Mutants are listed against a yellow, green or red background, to indicate that the altered residue belongs to \u03bb1650\u20131666, the rest of the CR-VI domain, or the +domain, respectively. They are also grouped according to whether they change the K-D-K-E tetrad, SAMP, SUBP or NSP. The results highlight the importance of essential SUBP residues (such as the K-K-G lysines K1991, K1992 and K1995 and \u03bb1650\u20131666 residues H1659 and R1662) for both 2\u2032O- and N7-methylation.

Helix \u03b1E, an element of the standard MTase topology (Fig. 1c), is present in VSV (3), as a result of which NSP may have disappeared. \u03b1X is at a different location (4), and is preceded by an extra helix (\u03b1x\u2032(5)). E1833, expected to belong to the K-D-K-E tetrad from sequence alignments, is buried in the structure and does not reach the surface of the catalytic pocket (6), and the position normally taken by the K-D-K-E glutamate is occupied by T1831.
