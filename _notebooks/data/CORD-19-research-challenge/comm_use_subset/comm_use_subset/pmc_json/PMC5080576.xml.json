Sample preparation was performed with the Quick amp WT labelling kit (Agilent) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. In short, 100 ng total RNA was used per sample as input for the generation of fluorescent complementary RNA (cRNA). This involved cDNA synthesis and amplification with simultaneous incorporation of cyanine 3-labeled CTP by the T7 RNA polymerase. Subsequently, the cRNA was purified with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) as instructed by the manufacturer\u2019s protocol and RNA concentrations measured by NanoDrop ND-1000 (Thermo Scientific). Next, 600 ng of each cRNA sample was fragmented at 60 \u00b0C for 30 min and hybridized to the microarray slides for 17 hours in a hybridization oven rotator (Agilent) at 65 \u00b0C.

Processing of the raw fluorescent microarray signals and differential expression analysis were performed with the Bioconductor R package limma (v3.20.9)25. First, background correction and quantile normalization was applied in order to make the 16 arrays comparable. Next, control probes and low expressed probes were filtered out. Probes were considered expressed when the fluorescent signal was 50% brighter than the 95% quantile of the negative control probes on at least two arrays. Subsequently, a linear model was fitted for each gene to estimate the variability in the data and differential expression analysis was performed at each of the four selected time points. Fold changes were calculated by an empirical Bayes method and the returned p-values were corrected for multiple hypothesis testing by the Benjamini-Hochberg method26. Probes with adjusted p-values <0.05 were considered significantly differentially expressed and annotations were added to identify the gene symbols that are linked to the probes. Information on the different lncRNA classes was exported from LNCipedia (www.lncipedia.org), these included: intergenic, sense-overlapping, antisense, intronic and bidirectional lncRNA classes. In a last step, enhancer regions (eRNAs) were filtered by making use of the database of predicted human enhancers (DENdb, http://www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/dendb/index.php)27.",

Additionally, the Ensembl Biomart tool was used for the retrieval of chromosomal coordinates of all mRNA transcripts of the corresponding reference genome30. Based on the chromosomal coordinates, overlapping mRNAs and the closest neighboring mRNAs within the same topological associated domain (TAD) and a distance of up to 500 kb from transcription start and stop sites were determined for each differentially expressed lncRNA using a custom R script. Six categories were used to classify neighboring genes as previously described: full or partially overlapping, head to head, tail to tail, nearby to head (sense and antisense strand), nearby to tail (sense and antisense strand) (Supplementary Data 3)1331. TAD information was downloaded from the ENCODE webserver (https://www.encodeproject.org/comparative/chromatin/#Hi-C) and was made available by Dixon et al32. Next, HIV interactions for the neighboring mRNAs were determined by making use of the HIV Interaction Database33. In addition, the epigenetic context of HIV linked mRNA-lnRNA pairs was determined for H3K4Me1, H3K4Me3, H3K27Ac, H3K36Me3 together with cap analysis gene expression (CAGE) peaks by making use of the Integrative Genomics Viewer34. Lastly, the co-expression database Co-LncRNA (http://www.bio-bigdata.com/Co-LncRNA) was browsed to determine similar co-expression events that correspond with our dataset35.",

This is consistent with data from Peng et al. who found similar percentages of DE expressed ncRNAs in CD4+ T cells upon HIV infection at 12 h and 24 h post infection18. Furthermore, DE mRNAs and lncRNAs between our dataset and Peng et al. showed an overlap of 44\u201345% and 8\u201313%, respectively. A possible reason for the lower percentage of overlapping lncRNAs is that lncRNAs are found, an overage, to exert a shorter half-life than mRNAs and could change in a more time-dependent manner linked to specific cellular processes42. Hence, lncRNA expression might be influenced to a larger extent than mRNAs because the datasets differ in the time points considered for transcriptome profiling. Nonetheless, these overlapping mRNAs and lncRNAs validate our experimental setup and form ideal targets to be further investigated in the context of HIV infection. For instance, a well-known and characterized lncRNA, MALAT1 (lnc-SCYL1-1) is found in both datasets and is already linked to viral infection43. In addition, in HIV infected individuals MALAT1 is shown as a potential biomarker44. In this context, it would be worthwhile exploring and comparing transcriptome datasets of other viral infections (i.e. CMV, HSV) to pinpoint lncRNAs involved in the broad process of antiviral defense. Our dataset is publicly available and can contribute to this goal.",

Interestingly, the guilt-by-association analysis showed that the majority of DE lncRNAs upon HIV infection could be functionally linked to the proteasome pathway. Indeed, it has been shown that (immuno-) proteasomes are recruited for cellular defense against incoming pathogens (i.e. HIV)484950. These complexes digest viral proteins and provide small peptides that can be presented by Major Histocompatibility Complex I (MHC-I) molecules on the cell surface in order to be recognized and killed by other immune cells. On the other hand, HIV has evolved a way to counteract this by Nef-mediated downregulation of the (immuno-) proteasomes and MHC-I presentation51. Other examples of proteasomal countermeasures include the Vif-mediated ubiquitination of the HIV restriction factor APOBEC3G/F, flagging it for proteosomal degradation, as well as Vpu-mediated downregulation of CD4 and tetherin through proteosomal degradation525354. In addition, the proteasome has been involved in the life cycle of many other viruses4855. Therefore, we hypothesize that the proteasome plays an important role in HIV escape mechanisms but also in cellular defense against pathogens and that lncRNAs are widely involved in this interplay between virus and host.",

This complex was shown to be largely involved in HIV latency establishment and epigenetic silencing62. PRC2 is also linked to proteasome and ubiquitination pathways which corroborates guilt-by-association findings63. Next, we found multiple TFs that were described to directly interact with HIV Tat. Hence, we might speculate that the lncRNA targets of these TFs are Tat induced. For instance, TAF1/3/7 are represented at the 18 h and 30 h time point regulating lncRNA expression. These TAFs take part in the TFIID-complex (transcription factor IID) that is described to be directly interacting with HIV Tat and can guide RNAPOLII transcribed target genes64. Beside Tat linked TFs, we found TFs that guide lncRNA expression with a role in the regulation of HIV transcription. The TF CHD1 is a chromatin reassembly factor that acts as a positive regulator of HIV transcription as upon knockdown a total block of HIV transcription was previously observed65. ATF3 is part of the SWI/SNF complex and is responsible for shuttling this complex to the HIV promoter and guide HIV transcription.

Furthermore, we introduced integrative analysis approaches to suggest biological roles for the DE lncRNAs in the context of HIV infection. Although our results are based on an in vitro cell line model for HIV infection with a pseudotyped HIV virus, these findings suggest that lncRNAs represent promising and potential targets for controlling HIV replication. These results need to be further explored and validated in primary cell models in order to fully grasp the impact of specific lncRNAs on HIV replication.",
