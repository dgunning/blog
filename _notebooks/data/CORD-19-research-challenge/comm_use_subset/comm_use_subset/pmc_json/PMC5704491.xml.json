In addition to canonical membrane-bound organelles, such as mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum, there are also many subcellular compartments that are enriched in selected proteins and nucleic acids but are not surrounded by a lipid bilayer (1). These structures have recently been termed biomolecular condensates to emphasize their common property of concentrating biological molecules (2). Many condensates behave as viscous liquid phases distinct from cytoplasm and nucleoplasm (3\u20139). A variety of evidence suggests that some may form via the physical process of liquid\u2013liquid phase separation (LLPS)2 (2, 9\u201312). The LLPS model is also supported in part by numerous observations that purified protein and RNA components of condensates can recapitulate the immiscible liquid structures in vitro (13\u201324).",

These structures have diverse roles in the metabolism of RNA, including splicing, modification, assembly, storage, degradation, and localization (25\u201328). Many RNA granule proteins contain multiple RNA-binding domains as well as large intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) (13, 29\u201331). The IDRs, as well as the folded domains, are important for assembly of RNA granules (32\u201336), and their phosphorylation can trigger granule disassembly (37\u201340). In vitro, tandem arrays of folded domains, including RNA-binding domains, can oligomerize and phase-separate when mixed with their multivalent cognate ligands, including repetitive RNAs (13, 14, 24, 41). IDRs can also self-associate and do so through a variety of side-chain interaction modes, including electrostatic, polar, and hydrophobic (42), as well as backbone modes that generate amyloid fibers and potentially other glassy structures (43, 44). These interactions can promote LLPS and/or formation of solid, amyloid-containing hydrogels (12, 16\u201318, 20\u201322, 29, 45).",

Aromatic residues appear to play particularly important roles in IDR interactions and LLPS. Cation-\u03c0 interactions between arginine and phenylalanine side chains are thought to be an important driving force for LLPS of the RNA helicase Ddx4 (16). Mutation or deletion of tyrosine residues in the BugZ and Nephrin intracellular domain proteins decreases their propensity to phase-separate (23, 46). Similarly, mutation of tyrosines blocks the formation of hydrogels by the IDR of the RNA-binding protein FUS (29). Tyrosine mutations also block recruitment of IDRs into hydrogels and/or phase-separated liquids formed by the RNA-binding protein hnRNPA2 (47) and FUS (29), as well as into RNA granules in cells (29). The enriched serine residues also likely play important roles in enabling the regulation of IDR interactions, as phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain IDR from RNA polymerase II prevents its recruitment into hydrogels of several IDRs (48).",

The FUS IDR can undergo LLPS on its own at high concentrations (45), and, when fused to the RNA-binding protein PTB, can promote RNA-induced LLPS (17). We found that, when tethered to a polySH3 domain protein that phase-separates when mixed with a cognate poly-proline\u2013rich motif (polyPRM) ligand, wild-type FUS decreases the threshold concentration for LLPS by 8-fold. The magnitude of this effect depends on the number of tyrosine residues in FUS but not on their positions within the sequence. Aromatic residues seem to be particularly important to the effect, as IDR mutants with all tyrosines mutated to leucine or serine do not phase-separate. Conversely, these IDR mutants actively oppose phase separation, increasing the LLPS threshold concentration above that for polySH3 + polyPRM alone. The IDR mutants do not strongly interfere with interactions between polySH3 and polyPRM but, rather, may act by destabilizing the highly concentrated droplet state through entropic effects. Phosphorylated FUS (pFUS) acts similarly to interfere with LLPS of the polySH3\u2013polyPRM system. Our data suggest that the specific amino acid composition of certain IDRs endows them with dual properties of either promoting or opposing LLPS by altering weak self-association of modular domain proteins. These effects could be used in both evolutionary and cellular processes to modulate the existence and properties of RNA granules.",

Sharp increases in A600 corresponded to the appearance of liquid droplets in solution (Fig. 1B), enabling us to use A600 to determine the threshold concentration for phase separation. SH33 and PRM4 phase-separated at 160 \u03bcm (Fig. 1C; except where explicitly noted, all concentrations are stated in terms of module concentration (the total concentration of SH3 domains or PRM elements) so that the molecular concentration of SH33 protein is one-third that of the module concentration). This threshold was unaffected by addition of FUS in trans at a protein concentration equal to that of SH33 (Fig. 1C). However, tethering wild-type FUS to SH33 (to give SH33\u2013FUS(WT)) decreased the threshold concentration 8-fold, to 20 \u03bcm (Fig. 1C), consistent with previous reports of cooperativity between IDRs and modular domain interactions in promoting LLPS (17, 20, 21). We note that, although the FUS IDR can also form amyloid-like fibers (29), at room temperature, the transition from droplets to fibers occurs on a timescales of hours (17), much longer than the 10 min used to make measurements here.

Random mutation of increasing numbers of these tyrosines to serines was shown to progressively decrease recruitment into FUS hydrogels and RNA granules (29). To learn which tyrosine residues in the FUS IDR are responsible for promoting LLPS of the polySH3\u2013polyPRM system, we systematically mutated groups of five consecutive tyrosine residues across the sequence to serine (FUS(5S-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6)) (Fig. 2A). We fused these mutants individually to the C terminus of SH33, and used A600 to determine the phase separation threshold in the presence of PRM4. All of the mutants phase-separated at 5- to 6.5-fold higher concentrations than wild-type FUS (Fig. 2B). For all but one, LLPS occurred in a narrow window between 120 \u03bcm and 130 \u03bcm (Fig. 2B), indicating that the contribution of tyrosine residues to LLPS is distributed relatively uniformly across FUS. The LLPS threshold for SH33\u2013FUS(5S-1) was 100 \u03bcm, slightly lower than that of the others, indicating that the first five tyrosine residues may be somewhat less important than the others (Fig. 2B). It is also possible that the adjacent SH3 domains influence the N terminus of FUS and prevent some of the first five tyrosine residues from making interactions that promote LLPS. Nevertheless, these data demonstrate that the aromatic sequence determinants for LLPS are relatively uniformly distributed across the FUS IDR. The number but not the position of aromatic residues determines the LLPS threshold. This behavior mirrors that of LLPS by multimodular domain proteins alone, where the phase separation threshold is dependent on domain valency (13, 15), suggesting conceptual similarity between the two molecular types.",

We fused the mutants to the C terminus of SH33 and determined the LLPS threshold in the presence of PRM4 (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S1). FUS(27F) promoted LLPS analogously to wild-type FUS, but much less strongly, decreasing the threshold only to 120 \u03bcm (versus 160 \u03bcm for SH33 + PRM4 alone). The other two mutants behaved quite differently in two respects. First, neither promoted LLPS, including FUS(27L), which would be classified as more hydrophobic than wild-type FUS in many hydrophobicity scales (53\u201355). FUS(27F) would also be classified as more hydrophobic than the wild type, but it too is less effective in promoting LLPS. Even in alternative hydrophobicity scales that classify tyrosine as extremely hydrophobic, leucine is placed to be more hydrophobic than phenylalanine (56, 57). Thus, promotion of LLPS does not appear to be dependent on simple hydrophobicity but, rather, specifically on aromaticity.",

Thus, if their aromatic content is lost, then low-complexity sequences can decrease the drive for phase separation by multimodular domain proteins. Notably, FUS(27S) does not alter the phase separation threshold concentration for SH33 + PRM4 when added in trans, even at concentrations as high as 1.5 mm (Fig. 1C). The opposing effect of FUS(27S) must thus be applied in cis.

One possibility is that FUS(27S) interferes with the interaction between SH3 and PRM that normally allows the proteins to oligomerize. To test this hypothesis, we used isothermal titration calorimetry to examine binding of SH33 to PRM4 with or without the attachment of FUS(27S) or FUS(27L) to SH33. Given the multivalent nature of the engineered proteins and the resulting complicated patterns of association, the isotherms could not be fit with a simple model. Nevertheless, the thermograms and isotherms under all three conditions were nearly identical, demonstrating that the interaction between SH3 and PRM was not strongly affected by FUS(27S) or FUS(27L) (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. S2).",

Such weak self\u2013self interactions are often assessed through the scattering second virial coefficient (A2), which is closely related to the osmotic second virial coefficient (B22) under dilute buffer conditions (60). These parameters reflect the deviation from ideal solution behavior because of pairwise interactions between solute molecules in a solution (61). For a variety of proteins, A2 correlates reasonably well with solubility, defined as the concentration of protein in a bulk solution phase that is in equilibrium with protein crystals or a condensed protein liquid phase (62\u201366). In the latter case, this corresponds to the threshold concentration for LLPS. Further, the \u201cdiffusion interaction parameter,\u201d kD, the linear change in protein diffusion coefficient with concentration, is a major component of B22 (67, 68). Negative values of kD (negatively correlated diffusion coefficient and concentration) correspond to favorable relative self\u2013self interactions, and more negative values have been shown to correlate with increased propensity for LLPS (69\u201374).",

To test this hypothesis, we used dynamic light scattering (DLS) and static light scattering (SLS) to measure the diffusion coefficients and scattering properties of SH33\u2013FUS proteins as a function of concentration. The relationship between diffusion coefficient (D) and protein concentration (c) can be approximately described by D = D0 (1+kDc), where D0 is the diffusion coefficient at infinite dilution. We obtained kD values by fitting the concentration-dependent diffusion coefficients (supplemental Fig. S3) to this equation. The kD values of SH33\u2013FUS(WT) and SH33\u2013FUS(27F) were more negative than that of SH33, indicating stronger self-interaction (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the kD of SH33\u2013FUS(27S) and SH33\u2013FUS(27L) were both less negative, indicating weaker self-interaction (Fig. 4A). A2 values were similarly calculated from the concentration dependence of scattering intensities, and the A2 values of the four proteins showed an analogous pattern (supplemental Fig. S5A). The difference of kD and A2 between the different fusion proteins correlates with their phase separation behaviors: FUS proteins that have stronger self-association undergo LLPS with PRM4 at a lower threshold concentration, whereas those that have weaker self-association produce a higher threshold concentration. DLS experiments also showed that, as concentration increased, although mixtures of SH33\u2013FUS(27S) and PRM4 did not undergo LLPS, they could still form larger complexes (inferred from smaller D values) than those required for phase separation of SH33\u2013FUS(5S-2) + PRM4 (Fig. 4B). With the caveat that D can reflect properties other than mass, these data are consistent with the idea that weaker self-association (and, by inference, higher solubility) opposes phase separation, even though oligomerization through SH3\u2013PRM interactions is largely unaffected.",

            "text": "FUS was identified previously as the substrate of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) in vitro (76). The four serine residues in the FUS IDR reported to be phosphorylated by DNA-PK (Ser-26, Ser-42, Ser-61, and Ser-84) are in close proximity to tyrosine residues (Tyr-25, Tyr-41, Tyr-58, and Tyr-81, respectively) (77), and phosphorylation impedes the formation of FUS hydrogels and targeting of FUS to preformed hydrogels (77). To test whether phosphorylation of FUS can affect LLPS of SH33 + PRM4, we incubated liquid droplets formed by SH33\u2013FUS(WT) plus PRM4 with recombinant DNA-PK, Mg2+, and ATP for 3 h. The liquid droplets disassembled almost completely by the end of the incubation period, whereas liquid droplets formed by SH33 (without FUS attachment) plus PRM4 were not affected by DNA-PK (Fig. 5). We further demonstrated that only SH33\u2013FUS(WT) but not SH33 can be highly phosphorylated by DNA-PK, confirming that the effects of the kinase are applied through the FUS IDR and specific to the FUS-containing system (supplemental Fig. S6). DLS experiments further showed that the kD of SH33\u2013FUS(WT) became less negative upon phosphorylation (creating SH33\u2013pFUS) (Fig. 4A). This result suggests that phosphorylation of FUS can disassemble liquid droplets by weakening the self-association of SH33\u2013FUS(WT). Thus, mutation of tyrosine residues and phosphorylation of proximal serine residues appear to act through similar mechanisms to disfavor LLPS.",

            "text": "Previous data suggested that LLPS contributes to the formation of RNA granules through cooperativity between multivalent RNA-binding domains, RNAs, and IDRs (17, 20\u201322). Our data here suggest that the ability of IDRs to promote LLPS may be general for multivalent proteins, as wild-type FUS, when tethered to SH33, can decrease the LLPS threshold concentration in the presence of PRM4 \u223c8 fold. Because the FUS IDR contains only five acidic residues and one basic residue (Fig. 1A), it is unlikely that charge effects primarily drive this behavior. Rather, as in the ability of FUS to form hydrogels and be retained by hydrogels (29), and as observed for LLPS by other IDRs (16, 23, 46), the numerous tyrosine residues in FUS are important for LLPS. Our systematic investigation of these tyrosine residues reveals that they are broadly involved in and contribute nearly equally to LLPS (at least at the resolution of five tyrosines). These observations are consistent with a previous NMR study on FUS indicating that the backbones of all residues display slower motions upon LLPS, suggesting distributed interactions across the length of the polypeptide chain (45). In contrast to this behavior of FUS, the IDR of hnRNPA2 binds to hydrogels and partitions into liquid droplets through Tyr/Phe interactions that are less distributed, with some positions contributing substantially more than others (47). It remains to be seen whether FUS-like (distributed) or hnRNPA2-like (focused) aromatic interactions are more prevalent in promoting LLPS and related behaviors of other IDRs.",

            "text": "Analyses of both natural IDRs, such as elastin (78), and engineered IDRs composed of repeated sequence motifs (79) have suggested that sequence hydrophobicity plays an important role in determining the driving force for LLPS. For FUS, however, hydrophobicity does not appear to be sufficient to enhance LLPS of polySH3\u2013polyPRM. Although there is no single best method for assessing amino acid hydrophobicity, all scales classify Tyr, Phe, and Leu as appreciably hydrophobic (53, 54, 80). Yet clearly Tyr and Phe act differently than Leu in modulating LLPS. The difference between Tyr/Phe and Leu suggests the likely importance of interactions such as \u03c0\u2013\u03c0, CH\u2013\u03c0, OH\u2013\u03c0, and NH\u2013\u03c0, provided by aromatic side chains, in promoting LLPS (81). Although the difference in interaction energy between a Phe pair and a Tyr pair can be minor in certain context (82), other studies have shown that the OH group in the phenol ring of Tyr enhances \u03c0-\u03c0 and CH-\u03c0 interactions (83, 84). This could potentially explain why Tyr is better than Phe at promoting LLPS. Additionally, the ability of the residues to organize bound water molecules is likely to play an important role, as loss of such waters is a major driving force for LLPS of elastin (85). Further biophysical studies are required to understand the importance of aromatic interactions in FUS.",

In related work, numerous experimental and computational studies have examined LLPS of elastin-like peptides (ELPs), which are sequence variants of natural elastin that phase-separate in response to changes in temperature and solvent conditions (85, 88). Many studies have examined the effects of joining folded domains or IDRs as fusion partners to ELP hosts (89\u201391). The analogy to our system is not exact because LLPS of ELPs is favored by increasing temperatures, in contrast to our system, where LLPS is favored by lower temperatures (supplemental Fig. S7). Nevertheless, as in our system, it has been observed that some fusion partners inhibit phase separation relative to the unfused ELP hosts.",

First, electrostatic repulsion by highly charged fusion partners may keep the host chains apart, preventing aggregation (91, 92). Second, fusion partners have been proposed to bind aggregation-prone sites, often partially unfolded regions that exist during folding, of hosts to prevent self-association (75). Third, in ELPs, the release of organized water from hydrophobic surfaces is known to be a principal driver of LLPS, and incorporation of charged residues in the ELP chain destabilizes those immobilized waters, decreasing the magnitude of this entropic effect (85, 93). It has been proposed that charged fusion partners could act similarly to decrease the driving force for LLPS of ELP hosts (91). Fourth, in a so-called entropic bristle effect, fusion partners occupy a large space that is restricted when other proteins bind the host, thus decreasing host self-association (86, 94). Although this effect is most often cited for IDR fusion partners, it could also occur with folded partners. Finally, ELP chains collapse upon LLPS, which produces an unfavorable decrease in configurational entropy. It has been proposed based on molecular dynamics simulations that non-interacting chains fused to the terminus of an ELP host would also lose configurational entropy themselves upon LLPS, increasing the size of this energetic penalty (95).",

Of these mechanisms, the first seems unlikely because FUS has little charge. The second is also unlikely, as the inhibitory effects are seen for both SH33 and PTB hosts, and, moreover, both systems involve well-folded domains that are unlikely to have substantial unfolded, aggregation-prone elements. The third also seems unlikely because release of water probably plays a lesser role in self-association/LLPS of highly hydrophilic folded domains than in highly hydrophobic ELPs. Moreover, it is not clear that fusing a chain to one end of even a hydrophobic polymer would have the same influence on bound waters as interspersing charged residues into the polymer. Thus, the fourth and fifth mechanistic possibilities, both involving nonspecific entropic effects, the former applicable to folded domain and IDR fusion partners, and the latter only to IDRs that collapse upon LLPS, seem most likely in our system.",

            "text": "In general, any element that changes the apparent self-association of oligomers has the potential to modulate phase separation and might be exploited by biological systems. First, our mutagenesis experiments reveal the importance of aromatic residues in promoting LLPS. The hydrophilic residues might be critical in opposing LLPS. Evolution could modulate the propensity of a molecule to undergo LLPS by changing the number of these residues as well as other residues in various contexts. A recent study has demonstrated that the usage of aliphatic residues in the low complexity region of Pab1, an RNA-binding protein in stress granules, and thus the hydrophobicity of this region, are shaped by natural selection (96). We notice that, in this study, similar to our observation, substitution of these aliphatic residues can either promote or repress LLPS of Pab1. Second, we have shown that phosphorylation of FUS can have a similar effect as direct substitution of aromatic residues (Fig. 5). Other posttranslational modifications of IDRs could conceivably do the same, and in other systems, phosphorylation could increase self-association, enhancing LLPS, as observed in SH2 domain-based signaling pathways (15, 41, 97). Further, in contrast to the covalently tethered MBP in our synthetic construct, a naturally occurring protein could non-covalently bind to phase-separated proteins in cells and promote or oppose LLPS. In fact, the latter has been observed in two systems that we are aware of. In the engineered fusion of an ELP host with the protein tendamistat, binding of the large polar protein porcine pancreatic \u03b1-amylase inhibits LLPS (91). In a more physiologically relevant example, the cytomegalovirus protein IE1 disrupts the phase-separated biomolecular condensate PML nuclear bodies (98). IE1 utilizes an N-terminal coiled-coil domain to bind directly to the PML protein, which is the essential scaffold of the PML nuclear bodies. However, the coiled-coil domain is unable to disrupt PML bodies. Rather, disruption requires the 20-kDa C-terminal domain of IE1, which is highly negatively charged and predicted to be highly disordered. Although the mechanism of the disruptive activity of IE1 has not been explored, the framework developed here suggests that the protein could act through using its coiled-coil domain to recruit its destabilizing C-terminal IDP to PML. As more factors are discovered that modulate the dynamics of biomolecular condensates, this physical mechanism may be more widely observed.",

The advantage of IDRs as modulator of LLPS lies in their versatile physical properties, which rely on their special amino acid compositions with three elements: the aromatic residues mediate short-range, aromatic interactions and promote LLPS; the abundant hydrophilic residues dominate the solubility of IDRs and oppose LLPS when aromatic interactions are lost; and the abundant serine and tyrosine residues can be readily phosphorylated, enabling rapid transitions between promoting and opposing LLPS. These properties should enable IDRs to modulate LLPS through evolutionary changes (by addition to or loss from a multidomain partner or by addition or loss of aromatic residues in the sequence) as well as during cellular processes involving alterations in the balance of kinase and phosphatase activities. These mechanisms could play important roles in controlling the physical properties, assembly/disassembly, and functions of cellular structures such as RNA granules.",

As a control, 83.3 \u03bcm SH33 was mixed 62.5 \u03bcm PRM4 with or without 114.1 units DNA-PK. SH33 was labeled with Oregon Green 488. All concentrations refer to molecular but not module concentrations. The samples were placed in a glass-bottom chamber coated with 3% BSA and washed three times with H2O. Images were taken 3 h after the initiation of the reaction with a Leica TCS SP8 laser-scanning confocal microscope.",

After 1 h incubation, the images of droplets were taken on a Leica-based spinning disk confocal microscope (electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) digital camera, ImageEM X2, Hamamatsu; confocal scanner unit, CSU-X1, Yokogawa). Background intensity was removed by subtracting the image of buffer alone. The image of a homogenous solution containing 2 \u03bcm Oregon Green 488 was taken under the same illumination condition. The maximum intensity of this image was used to divide the whole image. The resulting image was used to divide all images for correction of uneven illumination. The intensities at the center of the droplets were counted as the droplet intensities, which were then converted into the absolute concentration of labeled SH33\u2013FUS(WT) within droplets based on a standard curve generated by a series of pure Oregon Green 488 at 0.05, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, 2.00, and 4.00 \u03bcm. The final droplet concentration of labeled SH33\u2013FUS(WT) was the mean of 30 droplets from three independent samples. Because the ratio between total labeled and total unlabeled SH33\u2013FUS(WT) in the solution was known, the droplet concentration of unlabeled SH33\u2013FUS(WT) can be calculated from that of labeled SH33\u2013 FUS(WT).",
