            "text": "At the initial stage of viral infection, HA binds to the host respiratory cell receptor, which contains sialic acid, allowing the virus to enter the host cell through the endosomal pathway [3], [4]. HA is a homotrimeric transmembrane protein with a globular head and a stem region that are both exposed to the outside of the membrane [5]. These regions contain N-linked oligosaccharides [6], which have been known to affect the functional properties of HA [7], [8]. Glycosylation sites in the peptide sequences are highly conserved, indicating functional significance for HA glycosylation [9]. HA is synthesized as a precursor protein (HA0) that undergoes proteolytic cleavage into HA1 and HA2 subunits; HA1 mediates initial contact with the cell membrane, and HA2 is responsible for membrane fusion [10], [11]. HA is the primary target for antiviral agents such as infectivity-neutralizing antibodies [4] and nucleic acid aptamers [12]. The recombinant HA1 subunit, expressed and purified from bacteria, induces an immune response against the influenza virus in humans [13] and is sufficient for screening antiviral RNA aptamers [14]. The recombinant HA protein, which retains glycosylation, has been expressed and produced in a baculovirus/insect cell system, which exhibited enhanced HA inhibition and virus neutralization [15].",

They are usually obtained from an oligonucleotide library harboring random sequences by using the SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment) method [16], [17]. Compared with protein antibodies, aptamers have many advantages over protein antibodies, such as high affinity, rapid synthesis, low cost, low-temperature sensitivity, large-scale production, and ease of chemical modification [12]. To date, aptamers have been used in a wide range of applications as research reagents, for medical diagnosis, and as biosensor or therapeutic tools against viruses and cancer. [18], [19]. Previously, our group selected an RNA aptamer against HA1 of subtype H5 AIV, which specifically binds to HA1 and inhibits hemagglutination of erythrocytes in vitro\n[14]. The HA1-specific RNA aptamer HAS15-5 was screened using the recombinant HA1\u2013GST fusion protein that lacks glycosylation because of its expression in bacteria [14]. However, RNA aptamers specific to glycosylated HA rather than unglycosylated HA would be preferable for blocking and inhibiting influenza virus entry into host cells.",

For this experiment, the same amount of RNAs from each round was loaded onto an affinity column charged with the gHA1 protein. The affinity-eluted fractions (gHA1-bound RNAs) were collected and subjected to RT-PCR. PCR cycles were limited to 11 cycles to avoid saturation of cDNA amplification [14]. cDNAs were visualized and quantified by ethidium bromide staining on an agarose gel, which reflected the amount of RNA bound to gHA1. Based on quantitation of amplified cDNA, the 12th round RNA pool was more tightly bound to gHA1 than any other round of RNA pool or the negative control containing irrelevant RNA sequences (Fig. 4).",

Among the aptamer candidates, the HA12-16 aptamer exhibited the highest antiviral activity by revealing comparable cell viability in the uninfected cells. Of importance, the extent of cell viability is positively correlated with the binding affinity of the RNA aptamer to gHA1, as revealed by the binding assay (Fig. 5A).

For the assay, MDCK cells were incubated with the influenza virus in the presence or absence of the HA12-16 aptamer at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. The presence of the influenza virus was fluorescently analyzed by FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies bound to anti-HA primary antibodies. MDCK cells infected with the viruses were noticeably fluorescent because of the viruses attached to the cell membrane, whereas addition of the HA12-16 aptamer significantly reduced the FITC-fluorescence owing to the suppression of viral attachment to the cell membrane through aptamer-gHA1 binding (Fig. 6B). When the cells were only treated with the HA12-16 aptamer, FITC fluorescence on the cells appeared to be similar to the one treated with the viruses plus the aptamer. This result suggests that the HA12-16 RNA aptamer suppresses viral attachment to the host cells by neutralizing the receptor-binding site of influenza virus HA, which results in the inhibition of viral replication.",

The HA1 gene was cloned from subtype H5 of AIV and expressed in insect cells, and the glycosylated recombinant HA1 protein was purified for screening of RNA aptamers. Glycosylation of the purified HA1 protein was confirmed by cleaving glycans with PNGase F. After the 12 rounds of iterative SELEX, the RNA pool that binds to the gHA1 protein was cloned and sequenced, and RNA secondary structures were predicted. Among the 4 representative RNA aptamer candidates, HA12-16 was chosen because of its high binding affinity to gHA1 and suppression of viral infection in host cells. These results suggest that the RNA aptamer can recognize the viral HA, likely at or around the receptor binding region required for the penetration of influenza virus into host cells [27]. Interestingly, the previously selected RNA aptamer against the unglycosylated HA (HAS15-5) failed to inhibit viral infection in host cells. Thus, the HA12-16 aptamer isolated in this study is expected to interrupt influenza invasion through specific binding to the glycosylated ectodomain of HA, which is crucial for viral attachment to the host cell membrane. In future research, the selected RNA aptamers should be modified to improve stability by base modification of nucleotides, capping of RNA fragments, and end-labeling with appropriate chemicals resistant to RNase. If a stable RNA aptamer is combined with an appropriate RNA delivery method, which is necessary for therapeutic use [28], it can be used as an antiviral reagent that is comparable to antibodies and could be used as a therapeutic agent.",
