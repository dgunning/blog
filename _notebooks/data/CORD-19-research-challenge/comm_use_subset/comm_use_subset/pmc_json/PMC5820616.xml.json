Contributing factors include non-specific clinical presentation, lack of local advanced diagnostic capabilities and suboptimal infection prevention and control (IPC) practices, amplified by poor surveillance in struggling health systems. The epidemiological pattern of the 2014\u20132016 EVD outbreak in West Africa revealed a similar story, but this time with an unprecedented scale and geographic spread, resulting in a record number of affected health workers, with 881 cases and 513 deaths by late 2015\n4. Health workers are more likely than non-health workers to be infected: depending on the profession, the risk can be 21 to 32 times higher\n5.",

It became clear very early in the process that high quality efficacy and comparative effectiveness studies addressing the use of specific PPE items for EVD in outbreak settings were lacking\n8. In addition to the paucity of data, it was critically important to gather and include the perspectives of health workers who had \u201creal-life\u201d experience in ETUs in West Africa. Early reports of the local conditions indicated that broader clinical questions than PPE performance as a transmission barrier were as important: usability, comfort, dexterity and impact on communication with patients, for example. The underlying principle was that evidence from efficacy and comparative effectiveness studies was necessary but insufficient for contextualization and adequate decision-making. This approach highlights the importance of understanding the way individuals exercise judgement (values and preferences) when selecting options with potential benefits, harms, and inconveniences in real life and is current best-practice in WHO standard guidelines\n9. Values and preferences are often informed mainly by the opinion of guideline expert panel members, however such proxies for persons affected by the recommendations in a guideline are often inadequate or even inaccurate. Thus, in the early stages of the 2014\u20132016 EVD outbreak in West Africa, in the context of time constraints and the absence of published data, it was crucial to incorporate the values and preferences of health workers into the guideline development process.",

In subsequent sections, we used a four or five-point Likert-scale to examine participants\u2019 perceptions about the impact of each PPE item on the following domains: safety, communication, ability to provide patient care, personal wellbeing (heat and dehydration), and comfort. In addition, for each of the items, participants could provide free-text comments on open-ended questions to describe any difficulties or to provide suggestions on how PPE could be improved. The final section explored specific training needs and confidence in PPE. The last question asked participants to compare two sets of PPE available in West Africa shown side-by-side in a picture: one was composed of lighter items and the other had more robust components.",

We used maximum variation purposeful sampling, a non-probability sampling strategy, to capture a wide range of health worker perspectives and experiences in two organizations and four different countries affected by the EVD outbreak. Health workers were reached through a contact individual in each organization (MSF and WHO) who directly emailed potential participants. Physicians and nurses from the affected countries and from other international organizations were not included for pragmatic reasons given the extreme time constraints and infeasibility of obtaining additional organizational approvals in the available timeline. An initial communication error led to the participation of other groups of health workers that did not have frontline clinical experience. The perspectives of these workers were considered for WHO quality improvement efforts, but were excluded from this analysis as these groups were not part of the approved sampling frame for this study.",

Other considerations are also taken into account when an expert panel formulates recommendations, including feasibility, acceptability and resource implications of the intervention options, and the effects on equity across subpopulations. The relative value of the potential outcomes of the intervention options and the values and preferences of persons affected by the intervention are also important considerations. The findings of the survey were presented at the guideline development meeting and incorporated into evidence-to-decision tables (\nSupplementary File 2) to inform the formulation of recommendations for PPE components in the context of an EVD outbreak. Evidence-to-decision tables followed the GRADE-DECIDE\n11 approach and were populated by the WHO guideline development team in preparation for the expert panel meeting. These tables were key instruments used to present multiple sources of information to the guideline expert panel, helping to structure the discussion and to document the final judgements and decisions that underpin each recommendation.",

It is about using a set of behaviours with it and the understanding of\nall the underlying water and sanitation principles and applying them\u201d. Regarding hand hygiene, alcohol-based hand-rub was not always available and there was conflicting information in different settings about which product to use.",

Generally, participants were least confident about goggles (fogging, moving/displacing), medical masks and particulate respirators (difficulty breathing, becoming uncomfortable), and gloves (rolling down, tearing). Removing PPE was also an area that people felt less confident about (e.g., taking arms and feet out of a coverall, lack of face protection during undressing if the face shield was worn outside the hood). As one health worker illustrated:\n\u201cTaking off the (Tyvek suit) coverall was difficult due to my height; it required me to wiggle out of it more than the average person\u201d.\n A respondent also mentioned feeling less confident working in the screening area where much lighter PPE was worn, while possibly also being exposed to infectious patients.",

            "text": "Overall, our findings showed that health workers perceive a balance between transmission protection and the ability to effectively care for complex patients while using PPE. Health workers accept a certain degree of discomfort in return for the protection provided by PPE. The survey highlighted a slight preference of health workers for face shields compared to goggles because of less fogging, easier communication and better fit. There was no strong preference for one item of PPE over the other for all other PPE components. Given the variation in preferences for different components of PPE and the absence of data on comparative effectiveness, it may be important to provide a choice for health workers. This was, in fact, a guiding principle during the development of the PPE guidelines. Several issues raised by survey participants should be relatively straightforward to address, making a major contribution to health worker safety and comfort, such as providing a sufficient range of sizes, choice of equipment, and adequate training on how to put on and take off PPE in the conditions that will be faced in the field. Active training, in which health workers receive face-to-face training has been shown to improve doffing procedures\n13.",

Although this likely had a minimal impact on the results, we noted two questions that participants appeared to have difficulty comprehending (questions 11 and 23; see\nSupplementary File 1); if we had had more time for field testing we could have revised the questionnaire before formal data collection began. While our aim was to include only health workers who had provided direct patient care, such as nurses and physicians, given a communication error early in the study, we invited to participate and consequently received responses from workers without direct clinical experience who had been deployed to the EVD outbreak. Because these workers were not part of our pre-defined sampling frame, we excluded their responses from the analysis. Similarly, our survey failed to take into account the fact that PPE consists of different components such as eye protection, nose and mouth protection, gloves and body coverings that work together to protect the health worker from the risk of infection. In the first part of our questionnaire we asked how the survey participant experienced individual components of PPE (e.g., goggles or face mask). However, it is difficult to review these components as isolated items, separate from the rest of the PPE. As one survey participant noted: \u201c\nIt is the combination of the respirator and the face shield which is difficult. One or the other would be manageable but both together meant major impairment\u201d. Another survey participant commented: \u201c\nThe coverall would probably be better tolerated if we could breathe easier and see without problems\u201d. In addition, although we compared gowns and coveralls, we did not specify or ask about the materials the body coverings were made of, its level of fluid resistance, or whether the head cover was attached or not. Such issues can have a significant impact on health workers\u2019 experiences. For example, a simulation study carried out in Hong Kong in response to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) found that PPE made of more breathable material did not lead to a significant difference in contamination but did have greater user satisfaction\n13,\n14. It also became clear that solutions to an issue with one component of PPE could compromise the safety of another element of PPE. For example, participants mentioned that they would improvise and tape gloves to the coverall in order to prevent them from slipping down, but then the coverall would tear when removing the tape. Finally, the combination of different components of PPE may change the order in which PPE items are put on and taken off, thus end-users may perform donning and doffing procedures that are different than the training they received. This is particularly relevant if there are frequent changes in the availability of specific types of PPE, as was the case early in the outbreak response.",

This was in and of itself an invaluable learning experience for undertaking similar projects in the future. Specifically, we had to include only international health workers deployed by WHO and MSF in our study; therefore, we did not collect information on the values and preferences of local health workers and health workers deployed by other organizations. There were two important reasons as to why we selected our sampling frame. First, we carried out the survey at the height of the EVD epidemic when local doctors and nurses were fully engaged in the response efforts and we refrained from removing them from their primary work. Internationally recruited health workers on the other hand, were usually deployed for shorter periods and could thus participate when they returned home. Second, we had little time in which to execute the survey before the guideline meeting and we anticipated that it would be a lengthier and more complex process to identify and recruit local health workers. Thus, the findings of this survey may not be applicable to local health workers. In addition, generalizability of our findings to other international health workers involved in the Ebola response may be limited due to the small size of our purposive sample.",
