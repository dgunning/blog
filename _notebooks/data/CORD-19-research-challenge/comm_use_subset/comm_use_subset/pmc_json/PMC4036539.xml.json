Additionally, viral sequences have been identified in various biological raw materials used for cell culture such as bovine serum [6] and porcine trypsin [7]. Detection of latent viruses [8,9] or novel viruses [10] has also been reported in some cell lines by using the new methods. The development of new vaccines for current and re-emerging diseases such as AIDS and pandemic influenza has necessitated the use of novel cell substrates of human, canine, avian, and insect origin. A major challenge regarding use of these cell lines for vaccine manufacture has been addressing regulatory safety concerns related to the potential presence of viruses that may not be detected by the routinely recommended virus detection assays for cell line safety such as latent DNA viruses and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) as well as occult and unknown viruses [11]. While these technologies exhibit the potential for characterization of biological materials, their regulatory application requires rigorous and systematic evaluation including assay standardization and development of follow-up strategies for determining the biological relevance and significance of a positive result.

Virus detection using cell-based assays is generally based upon virus replication and the ability to produce a visual effect such as cytopathicity or hemadsorption/hemagglutination [11]; therefore, latent viruses and viruses lacking such biological properties may not be detected [12]. Accordingly, chemical induction assays can be used to activate latent viruses to enhance their detection [13]; however, the induced viruses may be novel and not detected by the currently available assays. For this reason, it is important to evaluate new technologies such as PLEX-ID, virus arrays, and MPS for broad virus detection. ",

Conserved regions are used to design broad-range primers for detection of virus families. The weight of the amplicons is determined by mass spectrometry and a base count (BC) composition of A, G, C, and T is generated; hence, known or novel organisms can be detected and identified by comparing genomic signatures to a curated BC database [15,17,18,19]. In the case of unknown microbial agents, a genomic signature is generated and the target family is identified [10,15]. Currently, the PLEX-ID Biopharma viral assays consists of four panels, which as a set, can detect approximately 35 viral families and potentially more than 1000 species belonging to the targeted viral families [20]. Although the number of samples analyzed per set is limited, the PLEX-ID platform can run and generate data for a large number of plates in one run. ",

Complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesized from the virus dilution panels was subjected to nested PCR amplification using XMRV gag primers or SFV-1 gag primers (Figure 1, a and b, respectively; +RT panels). An RT-minus PCR control (\u2212RT panels) was negative indicating the absence of cellular DNA contamination in the RNA preparations. The LOD in the absence of Sf9 nucleic acids for XMRV was 3.12 particles per \u00b5L (Table 1) and for SFV-1 was 40.2 particles per \u00b5L (Table 2); however, in both cases virus detection was 10-fold less sensitive in the presence of 105 cell equivalents of Sf9 nucleic acids.

Several endogenous retroviruses belonging to alpharetrovirus, betaretrovirus, or gammaretrovirus genera were identified [25,26]. Avian leukosis virus (ALV) sequences were detected by PLEX-ID in all human cell lines except HeLa. Furthermore, in-depth mass spectrometry analysis of each well, revealed \u201cunknown\u201d BCs that were not present in Athogen\u2019s curated database. Some of the peaks were found to be potential \u201cunidentified\u201d alpharetrovirus sequences, which were compared to Athogen\u2019s curated database. The analysis revealed that the BCs for the unidentified alpharetrovirus sequences were near-matches to ALV, human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K), or human mammary tumor virus (HMTV). This information revealed that the HeLa cell line, which appeared to be free of ALV sequences, did in fact harbor ALV-like sequences with a BC three mutations away from known ALV BCs. In addition, Rous-associated virus 2 (RAV-2)-like sequences were detected in Raji, A204, and HeLa cells. Similarly, unidentified betaretrovirus sequences were detected in all of the human cell lines (Table 3) and the BCs were found to be closely related to known HERV-K BCs. This analysis revealed that A204 and HEK293 were not outliers, but simply harbored an endogenous betaretrovirus whose BC was represented in the curated database, whereas the other human cell lines harbored variants of an endogenous betaretrovirus not found in the curated database. In addition, simian retrovirus 1 (SRV-1)-related sequences were detected in A204 and HEK293. Since alpharetroviruses and betaretroviruses were found in all of the human cell lines, a BLAST search was performed using their respective PLEX-ID forward and reverse primer sequences (data not shown). The analysis revealed multiple hits to human chromosomes, suggesting that the alpharetrovirus and betaretrovirus sequences detected were due to endogenous retroviral sequences known to be present in human DNA [26].",

Total nucleic acids extracted from MDCK cells were subjected to a nested PCR assay as described in materials and methods. Since the first round of PCR amplified a slightly longer fragment from the MDCK cells than the nested PCR, we used the 74 bp fragment instead of the 64 bp fragment for further analysis (Figure 2a). The DNA fragment, designated as MDCK74, was extracted by gel purification and nucleotide sequences determined. Comparison with the RD114 virus genome indicated 97% sequence identity (shown in Figure 3b). ",

Sequence hits with strong E-values ranging from 9e-23 to 2e-17 were found within several BAC clones (designated as A\u2013L in Figure 2b and listed in Table 4). Since the PLEX-ID amplicon was identified as RD114 and the sequence shared strong sequence identity with several Canis lupus familiaris BAC clones, an alignment was done with RD114 complete retrovirus genome (Genbank ID AB705392.1) as the query and the identified Canis lupus familiaris BAC clones (A\u2013L) as the subject entries (Figure 2b). Although PLEX-ID identified viral sequences belonging to RD114, the blastn alignment revealed three small regions (region 1, 2, and 3) with high alignment scores (80\u2013200 and >200) to RD114 gag and pol (Figure 2b). Each of these BAC clones was located in different regions of chromosome 1 or in different chromosomes altogether. Since gammaretrovirus-like elements have been shown to exist in abundance throughout the Canis lupus familiaris genome [37], it is likely that the viral sequences detected by PLEX-ID belong to RD114-like ERVs.

Proviral motifs were found in at least one location within each BAC clone; the range spanned by the provirus is listed in column 5 of Table 4. In some cases, two proviral sequence chains (seq) were detected within a single BAC clone. For example, clones xx-73E6, and xx-219I19 each harbored two potential proviral regions; one provirus sequence chain shared similarity with RD114 (e.g., CfERV A and D) and the other sequence chain did not (e.g., CfERV M and N).

In addition, analogous pol regions of human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1) and ALV were used as distant delatretrovirus and alpharetrovirus homologs, respectively. We aligned the nucleotide sequences using both ClustalW and MUSCLE alignment options in MEGA 5.1 (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis program) [36] to ensure the results were robust and not dependent on the type of alignment used. The phylogeny was constructed using a maximum-likelihood analysis based on the Kimura 2-parameter model (Figure 3) [34]. Bootstrapping (1000 replicates) was used to support the confidence at each node [35]. The results suggest that these ERVs diverged from a gammaretrovirus, perhaps RD114, but have undergone significant genetic change as demonstrated by the divergence within this set of sequences (Figure 3a).",

For both viruses, 10-fold serial dilutions (range 100\u201310\u22127) were made from the original virus stock and the number of particles per \u00b5L was determined based upon RT activity using a modified STF-PERT assay (designated as two-step fluorescent-PERT; TSF-PERT).

The STF-PERT one-step assay [40] was modified into a two-step assay that no longer requires the use of AmpliWax\u00ae PCR Gem 50, a product that has been discontinued. In addition, the TSF-PERT assay was designed as a partially automated process compatible with the Eppendorf epMotion 5070 robot (Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY, USA, cat. No. 960000111).

However, SFV-1 could not be detected by the PLEX-ID due to the absence of relevant primers. LLMDA was a log more sensitive for detection of both XMRV and SFV-1 as compared to PLEX-ID and RT-PCR, but LLMDA could not detect these viruses in a background of 104 cell equivalents of Sf9 total nucleic acids. Selected samples of the XMRV (RNA dilutions 10\u22126\u201310\u22127) and SFV-1 RNA panels (RNA dilutions 10\u22125\u201310\u22126) were also tested with the ViroChip. In the absence of Sf9 total nucleic acids, the XMRV 10\u22126 RNA dilution sample was detected by the ViroChip, whereas, the SFV-1 RNA dilution 10\u22125 was not detected. In addition to the LOD studies, we used the new virus detection methods to analyze some vaccine-related cell substrates for the potential presence of novel viruses. Total nucleic acids were used for the detection of both DNA and RNA viruses. Analysis of cell lines by PLEX-ID and virus microarrays indicated the presence of various retrovirus-related sequences. However, the origin of these sequences could be attributed to the presence of cellular DNA containing endogenous retroviral sequences or viral transcripts that may be expressed constitutively from some endogenous retroviral DNAs (proviruses) [43]. However, this situation is applicable to all nucleic acid-based assays that can detect retroviruses. To assess the origin and nature of the retroviral sequences a follow up strategy using PCR, sequencing, and bioinformatics was developed. The analysis revealed that the unexpected RD114 sequences detected by PLEX-ID in canine cell lines were associated with defective endogenous gammaretroviruses. Similarly, blast analysis and amplicon base count comparisons also revealed that endogenous retrovirus sequences were responsible for positive hits within the alpharetrovirus and betaretrovirus families detected in human cell lines.",

These results emphasize the need to use a combination strategy for virus detection in evaluating the safety of biologicals or screening patient samples. It was noted that some expected virus sequences that were known to be present as fragments in some cells lines were not detected by any of the methods: e.g., adenovirus in HEK293 cells and 293T/17 cells, and HPV in HeLa cells. This may be due to the absence of primers for the viral specific regions in the assays. These results also indicate the need for further updates of the PLEX-ID panels and virus arrays to enhance detection of known and novel viruses.",
