            "text": "Human behavior plays a significant role in the dynamics of infectious disease (Ferguson, 2007; Funk, Salath\u00e9 & Jansen, 2010). However, the inclusion of behavior in epidemiological modeling introduces numerous complications and involves fields of research outside the biological sciences, including psychology, philosophy, sociology, and economics. Areas of research that incorporate human behavior into epidemiological models are loosely referred to as social epidemiology, behavioral epidemiology, or economic epidemiology (Manfredi & D\u2019Onofrio, 2013; Philipson, 2000). We use the term \u2018behavioral epidemiology\u2019 to broadly refer to all epidemiological approaches that incorporate human behavior. While the incorporation of behavior faces many challenges (Funk et al., 2015), one of the goals of behavioral epidemiology is to understand how social and behavioral factors affect the dynamics of infectious disease epidemics. This goal is usually accomplished by coupling models of social behavior and decision making with biological models of contagion (Perrings et al., 2014; Funk, Salath\u00e9 & Jansen, 2010).",

One example is the effect of either awareness or fear spreading through a population (Funk et al., 2009; Epstein et al., 2008). In these types of models, the spread of beliefs or information is treated as a contagion much like an infectious disease, though the network for the spread of information may differ from the biological network (Bauch & Galvani, 2013). Other models focus on how individuals adapt their behavior by weighting the risk of infection with the cost of social distancing (Fenichel et al., 2011; Reluga, 2010) or other disincentives (Auld, 2003). Still others model public health interventions (e.g., isolation, vaccination, surveillance, etc.) and individual responses to them (Del Valle et al., 2005). Many of these models sit at the population level, incorporating the effects of social factors and abstracting away details about the individuals themselves.",

In this model agents that are vulnerable to infection may be in one of two states, susceptible or prophylactic, which is determined by their behavior. Agents in the susceptible state engage in the status quo behavior while agents in the prophylactic state employ preventative behaviors that reduce their chance of infection. We use a rational choice model to represent individual behavioral decisions, where individuals select the largest utility between engaging in prophylactic behavior (e.g., hand-washing or wearing a face mask) or non-prophylactic behavior (akin to the status quo). We also allow for the fact that individuals may not perceive the risk of getting infected accurately, but rather receive distorted information, for example, through the media.",

Each agent can be in one of four states: Susceptible (S), Prophylactic (P), Infectious (I), or Recovered (R). The difference between agents in states S and P is that the former engage in non-prophylactic behavior and do not implement any measure to prevent infection, while the latter adopt prophylactic behavior which decreases their probability of being infected (e.g., wearing a mask, washing hands, etc.). The adoption of prophylactic behavior, however, imposes costs on individuals that may prevent them from engaging in such behavior. In Western countries, for example, wearing a mask, other than uncomfortable, may signal a lack of trust in others or an unhealthy state, thus reducing social contacts. Agents in the infectious state I are infected and infective, while those in the recovered state R are immune to and do not transmit disease. The transition between states is captured with the state-transition diagram shown in Fig. 1. For reference, all the parameters and variables in the SPIR model are listed and defined in Table 1.",

            "text": "This sub-model assumes that in each time step, three types of events occur: (1) interactions among agents and any infections that may result, (2) behavioral decisions to engage in prophylactic or non-prophylactic behavior, and (3) recoveries. All agents interact by pairing themselves with another randomly selected agent in the population. Given four possible states, there are ten possible pairwise interactions. However, only two types of interactions can change the state of an agent: \u3008S, I\u3009 and \u3008P, I\u3009. For the interaction \u3008S, I\u3009, the susceptible agent S is infected by the infectious agent I with probability bS. For the interaction \u3008P, I\u3009, the prophylactic agent P is infected by the infectious agent I with probability bP, where bP \u2264 bS. The probability bP is linearly related to probability bS by the coefficient \u03c1 (i.e., bP = \u03c1bS). Thus (1 \u2212 \u03c1) is the protection acquired by adopting prophylactic behavior. Assuming well-mixed interactions, the proportion of infectious agents i represents the probability that an agent is paired with an infectious agent and the per time step probability of an agent in state S or P being infected is ibS or ibP, respectively. In addition to interacting, susceptible and prophylactic agents have probability d per time step of making a behavioral decision to engage in prophylactic or non-prophylactic behavior. The agents\u2019 behavioral decision is reflected in the indicator function W(i) (see details in Behavior Decision Model), and they engage in the prophylactic behavior when W(i) = 1 (i.e., adopt state P) and the non-prophylactic behavior when W(i) = 0 (i.e., adopt state S). Infectious agents have probability g per time step of recovering. We implemented an agent-based version of the disease dynamics model using the Gillespie algorithm (Gillespie, 1976) (source code available in Supplemental Information 1).",

Specifically, they believe that they will spend the amount of time TX in state X \u2208 {S, P}, where the time TX has a geometric distribution with parameter ibX, censored at the planning horizon H. When their time in X is over, agents know they will move to state I where the amount of time they expect to spend in state I has a geometric distribution with parameter g censored at the time remaining, H \u2212 TX.

We can visualize switching points by plotting the expected utility for the susceptible and prophylactic states as a function of the proportion of infectious agents. A switching point is where the expected utilities cross, if they cross. Figure 2A illustrates the situation in which the utilities do not cross, thus there is no switching point. Figure 2B illustrates the situation in which there is a single switching point; below the switching point the susceptible state has the higher utility, whereas above that point the prophylactic state has the higher utility.

The figure is divided into three regions\u2014A, B, and C\u2014that correspond to the three different utility situations illustrated in Figs. 2A, 2B, and 2C respectively. Region A corresponds to the situation in which agents never engage in prophylactic behavior because the utility of being in the susceptible state is never less than the prophylactic state regardless of disease prevalence (Fig. 2A). This situation occurs for low protection efficacy or short planning horizons. In the case of low protection efficacy, agents do not have an incentive to adopt prophylactic behavior because they expect to get infected regardless of their behavior. Thus, their best strategy is to become infected and then recover in order to collect the recovered payoff as quickly as possible (i.e., \u201cget it over with\u201d). In the case of short planning horizons, the relative contributions of the expected times of being in the susceptible or prophylactic state dominate the utility calculations, as shown in Fig. 3. The figure illustrates how, when the planning horizon is short, the expected percentage of time spent in the susceptible or prophylactic states are much greater than the expected percentage of time spent in the infectious or recovered state. Given that the susceptible payoff is greater than the prophylactic payoff, agents never adopt prophylactic behavior. The figure also shows how increasing the planning horizon changes the distribution of time spent in each state, which reduces the influence of the difference between the susceptible and prophylactic payoffs on behavioral decision.",

The SPIR and Fenichel et al. models generate similar results, but differ in several aspects. In the latter, susceptible agents optimize their contact rate by balancing the expected incremental benefits and costs of additional contacts. Moreover, the agents take into consideration only the payoffs of being susceptible and recovered when optimizing the contact rates. In the SPIR model, however, agents maintain a constant contact rate, yet adopt prophylactic behavior that reduces the chance of getting infected. When agents are deciding to engage in prophylactic behavior, they take into account the payoff of all possible epidemiological states. The fact that we reach the same conclusion using different models further supports the claim that the planning horizon is a relevant decision making factor in understanding epidemic dynamics.",

One problem with increasing the risk perception is that if it is overdone, it leads, in some situations, to the opposite result to the one that is desired. Because individuals perceive their chance of getting the disease as highly probable, they prefer to \u201cget it over with\u201d and enjoy the benefits of being recovered.

Consequently, this modular and flexible model architecture facilitates the execution of comparative studies with different behavioral decision models coupled to a common epidemiological model, which we plan to perform as future work. For example, an interesting avenue of investigation is to relax our assumptions about rationality. There are a number of psychosocial theories that have been developed to predict, explain, and change health behaviors, such as the Health Belief Model (Becker, 1974) and the Social Cognition Theory (Bandura, 1986).
