DENV infection causes a wide range of clinical signs in humans, from asymptomatic to acute febrile illness (dengue fever, DF), to severe hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndromes (DHF/DSS) [1]. Dengue disease is a major public health problem in developing tropical countries and has being continuously spreading to new geographical areas [2, 3]. Frequent international travel to dengue endemic or epidemic regions has contributed to the escalating numbers of imported dengue cases in temperate region. Outbreaks of the four DENV serotypes have been increasing reported in the tropics and sub-tropics mainly in Asia, South America, and the Caribbean; multiple virus serotypes have been found co-circulating in the hyperendemic regions in Southeast Asia and Pacific [2]. Taiwan, located in the tropical-subtropical region of the Northern Hemisphere, has seen many DENV outbreaks since the first half of 20th century. Since 2006, southern Taiwan has faced dengue outbreaks of different scales every year; relatively large outbreaks occurred in 2014 and 2015, with DENV-1 and -2 being the major serotype, respectively [4].",

DENV serotyping is important for disease management and public health surveillance. Several reports have indicated that DENV-2 and DENV-3 may cause more severe diseases and that DENV-4 is responsible for a milder illness than the other serotypes [6]. In addition, antibody-mediated enhancement (ADE) of DENV infection further complicates disease severity [7]. Chances for developing DHF-DSS is elevated when infection with one of the four serotypes is followed by a heterotypic serotype; the replacement of DENV-3 by DENV-1 in Sri Lanka in 2009, was associated with a wave of severe dengue epidemic in Sri Lanka [8\u201310].",

Current methods to aid diagnosis of DENV infection include virus isolation (e.g. antigen detection immunofluorescence assay), nucleic acid amplification tests (NATs; e.g. reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR], real-time RT-PCR [qRT-PCR]), and serological assays (e.g. NS1 antigen detection, plaque reduction neutralization titers (PRNT), and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) [15]. Although a number of NS1 rapid diagnostic tests are commercially available to detect NS1 antigen during the first few days of fever, they do not provide serotype information [16]. PRNT, antigen detection immunofluorescence assay are able to determine DENV serotypes [17], but they are both time-consuming, expensive, laborious, and feasible only in well-equipped laboratories. With relatively high specificity and sensitivity, NATs were recommended for the detection of DENV RNA by the World Health Organization [1]. Several multiplex qRT-PCR methods capable of serotyping have been reported [18\u201320]. However, performance of qRT-PCR tests requires skilled technicians and relatively expensive equipment that are not available to remote areas or developing countries; transportation of specimens is another major obstacle. In order to bring early serotyping of DENV to points of need (PON), a rapid, easy, mobile, NAT method of high sensitivity and specificity is needed.",

For this purpose, 20 DENV-1, 20 DENV-2, 20 DENV-3, and 20 DENV-negative samples previously identified by a real-time PCR [34] were used.

Among them, real-time RT-PCR allows serotyping of DENV. However, this technology is in general not available at most PONs to provide timely serotyping results in regions with threats of epidemic dengue; RNA degradation during the shipping process to the central laboratories is also a concern [43]. The POCKIT or POCKIT Micro Plus device has been bundled with the field-deployable taco mini extraction system in a durable suitcase (POCKIT combo, POCKIT Micro combo, respectively; GeneReach) to meet the needs of PON applications at different settings. The equipment can be operated with a car battery or a rechargeable battery and only a few simple steps are needed from sample to results with this mobile PCR system.",
