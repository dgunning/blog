            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a member of the Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, is a pathogen of domestic chickens that causes acute, highly contagious respiratory disease [1,2]. The IBV genome contains a single, positive-strand RNA molecule, which is about 27.6 kb long and has a cap at the 5\u2032end and poly (A) tail at the 3\u2032end [3]. It comprises ten open reading frames (ORFs) and the first 20 kb genome is made up of ORF1, which is a replicase gene. The replicase has two ORFs, 1a and 1b [4]; among which 1b is produced as 1ab polyprotein by a -1 ribosomal frame-shifting mechanism [4]. The ORF1 encodes non-structural proteins associated with RNA replication and transcription. The IBV genome codes for four major structural proteins; the spike (S) glycoprotein, the small envelope (E) protein, the membrane (M) glycoprotein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein [5]. In addition to this, IBV has other genes that encode for non-structural proteins interspersed among structural genes, namely 3a, 3b, 5a and 5b [6].",

Many serotypes have been described for IBV, probably due to the frequent point mutations that occur in RNA viruses and also due to recombination events [9\u201311]. It is essential to characterize field isolates for the selection of appropriate vaccine strains.",

Out of 106 isolates made, three were not neutralized by any kind of serum. Two of these appear to be identical on the basis of a serum neutralization test and had been designated as Maryland 27 (Md27). The Md27 antiserum has an unusually broad spectrum of minor cross-reactions with the other viruses [12]. The Md27 strain has never been characterized by sequencing and it is essential to sequence these typical strains to understand the evolution of IBV geographically and also to implement an effective vaccination program to control new variant IBV strains. Here, we describe the complete sequence analysis of the 7.27 kb of 3\u2032end of the genome of Md27 IBV strain and its comparison and phylogenetic relationship with many heterologous IBV strains, and other coronaviruses from different parts of the world.",

The spike protein gene of Md27 is 3507 nucleotides long (1168aa) and codes for a protein of approximately 128.6 kDa. The transcription regulating sequence (TRS) CTTAACAAA is located 49 nucleotides from the start codon of the spike gene. The spike protein is most likely glycosylated and has 22 potential N-glycosylation sites (Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr) which are predicted by NetNGlyc 1.0 server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/). Hydrophobicity analysis (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM) predicted the occurrence of one transmembrane (TM) domain at (1100\u20131122aa) in the C-terminus of the spike protein and one endodomain (1122\u20131168aa). The Spike protein is cleaved into S1 and S2, of which S1 produces neutralizing and serotype specific antibodies [13,14]. The spike protein cleavage site for Md27 (His-Arg-Ser-Arg-Arg/Ser) is located between residues 544 and 545. The S1 protein is closely related to the SE17 strain (96% identity) and exhibits <86% identity with other IBV strains. The S2 gene is more conserved than S1 and has 98% identity with Ark DPI, Gray, Jilin, JMK and SE17 strains. The S2 subunit may also induce serotype specific neutralizing antibodies and S2 subunits are conserved within a serotype but not between serotypes [15]. There is a notable deletion of 3 nucleotides in the S1 gene between nucleotides 69 and 70, which is different from other Ark-like strains.",

The S1 and S2 genes of Md27 exhibit 96% and 98% identity, respectively, with SE17. Most of the nucleotide differences between Md27 and SE17 are in the S1 gene, especially in the hypervariable regions (HVR). The remainder of the structural sequence is not available for SE17, so it is difficult to conclude the genetic relationship of other genes of Md27 with SE17. Based on the limited data available (as many other strains are not yet sequenced), it is conceivable that the spike gene is derived from SE17 by recombination.",

Table 2 shows the comparison of the entire 7 kb genome of Md27, which reveals that Ark DPI and Jilin share high levels of sequence identity with Md27. Earlier we reported that Jilin is actually an Ark DPI strain [28]. Ark DPI was isolated during the 1980s [27], and it was demonstrated that Ark DPI is a direct derivative of the Conn strain [28]. This study suggests that Md27 and Ark DPI are derived from the same ancestor, but diverged independently by recombination with different strains. Several factors determine IBV evolution, mainly high mutation rate due to the absence of proof-reading mechanisms, and recombination between strains because of widespread use of live vaccines, immunological pressure and frequent mixed infections [29\u201331]. Our data has provided the evidence that both genomic mutations and intergenic recombination have taken place in the evolution of Md27 IBV strain and its descendents.",
