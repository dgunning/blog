As previously reported343536, high levels of CEACAM1 expression were detected on blood granulocytes (Ly6G+) and monocytes (CD115+) with the anti-CEACAM1-specific monoclonal antibody (clone CC1, Fig. 1a). Cells from Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 mice stained negative for CEACAM1 (Fig. 1a). Next, we analysed CEACAM1 expression on lymphoid cells in the blood. CD90.2 cells, representing primarily T cells, showed weak CEACAM1 expression by individual cells (Fig. 1b), a finding suggesting that various T-cell subpopulations may differentially express CEACAM1. B cells in peripheral blood expressed CEACAM1 at high levels (Fig. 1b). Evaluation of precursor (B220+CD43\u2212IgM+IgDlow) and mature B cells (B220+CD43\u2212IgDhigh) in the bone marrow revealed strong CEACAM1 expression in the B-cell lineage (Fig. 1c). In line with this finding, lymph node B cells, follicular B cells (FO, B220+CD19+CD21/35loCD23hi) and MZ B cells (B220+CD19+CD21/35hiCD23lo) in the spleen expressed CEACAM1 at high levels (Fig. 1d,e). Furthermore, quantitative RT\u2013PCR analyses of expression of long and short isoforms of CEACAM1 showed that murine splenic B cells express more long than short isoforms (Fig. 1f). In conclusion, strong CEACAM1 expression was detected in all B-cell subpopulations tested, a finding implying that CEACAM1 is functionally relevant in B cells.",

            "text": "Recently, expression of CEACAM1 in granulocytes was shown to lead to Syk phosphorylation37. In addition, expression of CEACAM1 participates in Btk phosphorylation38. In B cells, Syk and Btk are essential signalling molecules, which are phosphorylated after BCR or BAFFR crosslinkage and play an essential role in induction of survival signals1539. We thus focused on the influence of CEACAM1 on Syk activity during CEACAM1 and BCR crosslinkage. Indeed, in B-cell lymphoma immunoprecipitation of CEACAM1 pulled down Syk (Supplementary Fig. 2), which confirms the recently published interaction of Syk and CEACAM1 (ref. 37). To get insights into the functional relevance of CEACAM1 in B cells, we isolated splenocytes from WT and Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 mice and challenged them with anti-IgM, anti-CEACAM1 activating antibody (monoclonal antibody, CC1) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Ig-\u03b1, which associated with BCR, showed slight tyrosine-phosphorylation after IgM crosslinkage (Fig. 2a, left panel). Neither anti-CEACAM1 monoclonal antibody challenge nor LPS treatment induced phosphorylation of Ig-\u03b1 (Fig. 2a, right panel). We subsequently analysed Syk tyrosine phosphorylation in WT and Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 mice. As expected BCR crosslinkage induced strong Syk phosphorylation. Absence of CEACAM1 strongly reduced Syk phosphorylation after BCR crosslinkage (Fig. 2b, left panel). Challenge with anti-CEACAM1 monoclonal antibody also triggered phosphorylation of Syk, which was stronger than LPS-induced Syk phosphorylation (Fig. 2b, right panel). Therefore, we concluded that CEACAM1 enhances Syk phosphorylation not only directly, but also after BCR crosslinkage. Next we analysed the downstream target of Syk, Btk, another member of the Tec family of non-transmembrane PTKs. Flow cytometric analysis showed that Btk is transiently phosphorylated in B cells derived from WT but not in Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 mice after challenge with anti-IgM (Fig. 2c, upper panel) antibody. Similarly, anti-CEACAM1 monoclonal antibody challenge induced Btk phosphorylation in WT B cells (Fig. 2c, lower panel). We therefore conclude that CEACAM1 directly influences the phosphorylation of Syk and Btk, after BCR and CEACAM1 crosslinkage. To gain insight into downstream targets of CEACAM1 activation, we analysed specific Syk substrates. We observed that the CEACAM1 signal phosphorylate Erk1 (Erk-42) but not Erk2 (Erk-44) and, to a lesser extent, p-38. LPS could phosphorylate both Erk1/2 and p-38 (Fig. 2d,e). Triggering with the anti-CEACAM1 monoclonal antibody induced degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and slight phosphorylation of p65, a finding suggesting that CEACAM1 signals activate the canonical NF-\u03baB pathway (Fig. 2f).",

Indeed, lack of CEACAM1 led to reduced expression of Bcl6, Pax5, Bcl2a1 and Xiap (Fig. 2g). In line with the known positive feedback loop of NF-\u03baB, we found reduced expression of NF-\u03baB p65, Rel-B, Nfatc1 and Nfatc2 in Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 B cells (Fig. 2h,i). c-Jun, c-Fos and Ap1 were not influenced by CEACAM1 expression (Fig. 2j). Blimp1, which is another key regulator of plasma cell differentiation, was not affected by CEACAM1 expression (Fig. 2k). Taken together, we found that CEACAM1 contributed to the Syk phosphorylation during BCR and/or CEACAM1 crosslinkage, leading to the enhanced expression of NF-\u03baB, NFAT and survival genes.",

Challenge with LPS (TLR4-ligand) or CD40/IL-4 induced proliferation that was comparable between WT and Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 B cells (Fig. 3a).

First, we quantified the total number of living B cells with diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) beads. Without any further challenge, WT B cells consistently died under our in vitro culture conditions (Fig. 3b), a finding that agrees with that of a previous study40. Lack of CEACAM1 enhanced death of B cells (Fig. 3b). When challenged with CD40/IL-4, the numbers of WT B cells were higher than those of non-activated B cells after 24 h (Fig. 3b). The numbers of Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 B cells 24 h after stimulation with CD40/IL-4 increased similarly to those of WT B cells, however, declined rapidly 24 h after challenge with CD40/IL-4 (Fig. 3b). This rapid decrease was probably due to apoptosis and cell death, because Annexin-V staining was significantly enhanced in none activated and activated DAPI\u2212, B cells (Fig. 3c). We postulate that defective survival of Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 B cells was due to limited Syk and Btk phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, we treated WT and Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 B cells with the Btk inhibitor Ibrutinib41. We observed that inhibition of Btk in WT B cells led to the rapid death of B cells. This effect was less pronounced in Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 B cells (Fig. 3d). In conclusion, we found that lack of CEACAM1 signal limited survival of resting and activated B cells.",

During maturation, several activating stimuli allow B cells to progress through various stages (Fig. 4a). To determine the influence of CEACAM1 on survival during B-cell proliferation, we analysed B-cell subsets in bone marrow, peripheral blood, lymph node and spleen of WT and Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 mice. We found that B-cell precursor subsets in the bone marrow are reduced only in stages B, C and C\u2032 (Fig. 4b). However, after stage C\u2032 they expand more rapidly; therefore, the numbers of newly formed B cells in stages D and E are similar in WT and Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 4b). This finding is concordant with the similar numbers of newly formed (immature, B220+IgM+) B cells in the peripheral blood (Fig. 4c). These findings are also in line with previously published experiments showing that there is no difference in B-cell numbers in the peripheral blood of Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 mice27. Therefore, we conclude that the generation of newly formed B cells is hardly affected by CEACAM1. B-cell analysis in the peritoneal cavity showed that the frequency of B2 (CD19+B220+CD43\u2212) B cells was slightly reduced. B1a (CD19+B220+CD43+CD5+) B-cell frequency was significantly reduced, whereas the B1b (CD19+B220+CD43+CD5\u2212) B-cell population was higher in Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Supplementary Fig. 4).",

In lymph nodes, the numbers of newly formed (CD19+IgM+IgDlow) B cells in WT and Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 mice were similar (Fig. 4d). In contrast, the numbers of matured (M, CD19+IgDhigh) B cells were significantly reduced in the lymph nodes of Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 4d). In the spleen, the T1, T2 and T3 populations of transitional B cells were reduced in the absence of CEACAM1 (Fig. 4e). The numbers of follicular B cells I (Fol I) and II (Fol II), MZ precursor cells and MZ B cells were dramatically reduced in the spleen of Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 4e). In line with this finding, the numbers of mature B cells (stage F, B220+CD43\u2212IgDhigh) in the bone marrow were reduced in Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 4b). Similarly, histologic analysis showed lower numbers of B cells in the spleen and lymph node (Fig. 4f) and the absence of MZ B cells as well as low numbers of metallophilic (CD169+) macrophages in Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 4g). To strengthen our hypothesis that reduced Syk phosphorylation after B-cell-activating factor receptor (BAFFR) or BCR activation, but not TLR or Fcgr2b signalling, is responsible for reduced B-cell numbers in Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 mice, we performed histology of Jh\u2212/\u2212, Baffr\u2212/\u2212, Fcgr2b\u2212/\u2212 and Myd88/Trif\u2212/\u2212 mice.

Adoptively transferred WT B cells survived in the Jh\u2212/\u2212 mice and repopulated the spleen within 30 days (Fig. 4h). In contrast, Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 B cells were not detectable after 30 days (Fig. 4h), a finding suggesting that the absence of intrinsic CEACAM1 limits the survival of B cells after proliferation in Jh\u2212/\u2212 mice. To gauge the direct influence of CEACAM1 expressed on B cells, we made use of mixed bone marrow chimeras, where the irradiation of WT (CD45.2) mice was followed by reconstitution with bone marrow from WT (CD45.1) and WT (CD45.2, mixed 1:1) or WT (CD45.1) and Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 (CD45.2, mixed 1:1) mice. Analysis of peripheral blood showed some, but not statistically significant differenc in blood B-cell levels between WT and Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 cells (Fig. 4i). In contrast, splenic MZ B cells were only derived from WT (CD45.1) mice (Fig. 4j). FO B cells were also mainly from WT (CD45.1) origin (Fig. 4j). This suggests that CEACAM1 B-cell intrinsic signals are essential for B-cell survival after B cells home to the spleen. Next, we analysed how the lack of CEACAM1 contributes to antibody production in unchallenged mice. Analysis of various immunoglobulin (Ig) subtypes in the serum of na\u00efve WT and Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 mice showed a reduction in IgM, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3, IgA and IgE in Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Supplementary Fig. 6). In conclusion, CEACAM1 expression influences survival in mature B cells.",

            "text": "Next, we analysed the role of CEACAM1 during antigen challenge. We infected mice with VSV, a cytopathic pathogen for which systemic control strongly depends on the rapid induction of neutralizing antibodies42. We found strong expression of CEACAM1 in the MZ (Fig. 5a), a site at which VSV-specific B cells become activated4344. Because CEACAM1 is a natural CEACAM1 ligand, this finding suggests that CEACAM1 may release an important survival signal during antigenic challenge. To determine the role of CEACAM1 during B-cell activation, we transferred same number of B cells from Vi10 mice (WT \u00d7 Vi10), which express a VSV-specific BCR or from Vi10 mice crossed to Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 \u00d7 Vi10), into WT mice and infected them with VSV. After 3 days, the number of WT \u00d7 Vi10 B cells but not Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 \u00d7 Vi10 B cells was expanded (Fig. 5b). In the absence of stimulation, Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 \u00d7 Vi10 B cells were reduced as compared to WT \u00d7 Vi10 B cells (Fig. 5b), a finding indicating that CEACAM1 provides an important survival signal in antigen-activated and non-activated B cells. In line with these data, Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 mice displayed delayed induction of total VSV-neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 5c, left panel). In agreement with this finding, Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 mice failed to generate neutralizing IgG antibodies (Fig. 5c, right panel). ELISA confirmed that VSV-specific IgG levels were significantly low in Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Supplementary Fig. 7, right panel). Notably, anti-VSV IgM levels were significantly reduced in Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Supplementary Fig. 7, left panel). During challenge with non-replicating ultraviolet-inactivated VSV, Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 mice did not secrete neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 5d), a finding suggesting that Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit strongly impaired B-cell functions. To demonstrate that CEACAM1 expression by B cells is responsible for poor VSV-neutralizing antibody responses, we adoptively transferred CEACAM1-competent VSV-specific B cells into WT and Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 mice. This adoptive transfer of B cells rescued VSV-neutralizing antibody responses (Fig. 5e). Detailed analysis showed that both MZ and FO B cells could rescue the VSV-neutralizing antibody response in the Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Supplementary Fig. 8). Absence of early neutralizing antibodies can result in the spread of VSV to the nervous system45. To determine whether a reduction in the levels of neutralizing antibodies in Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 mice affected the immune response of virus control, we analysed organ virus titres 8 days after systemic VSV infection. Indeed, Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited VSV replication in the brain and spinal cord, whereas WT mice controlled VSV replication in all organs (Fig. 5f). VSV replication in Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 brains was associated with the death of mice (Fig. 5g). To determine whether a diminished B-cell response contributed to mortality, we performed survival experiments. Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 mice with adoptively transferred VSV-specific WT B cells survived VSV infection (Fig. 5h). Therefore, B-cell intrinsic expression of CEACAM1 is essential for initiating a protective antiviral immune response after exposure to VSV.",

How this diverse process can be regulated by BCR signals remains unexplained. We suggest that CEACAM1 is another strong regulator of B-cell survival. This is supported by previous findings that CEACAM1 regulates apoptosis in granulocytes49. Because CEACAM1 is expressed most strongly by B cells, and because CEACAM1 is its own ligand, we suggest that CEACAM1 induces positive survival signals primarily on B cells within the B-cell follicles and that CEACAM1 acts as a positive feedback loop once B cells reach the B-cell follicle.

In line with these results, monoclonal antibody activation of CEACAM1 led to Syk phosphorylation. These data suggest that CEACAM1 directly interacts with BCR signalling and therefore would influence the tonic BCR signal as well as antigen-dependent BCR activation. Tonic BCR signalling, but also BAFFR signalling, induces several survival genes via Syk. Therefore, lack of BCR and BAFFR signalling limits B-cell development and survival. Indeed, in line with data from Jh\u2212/\u2212 or Baffr\u2212/\u2212 mice, Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 mice showed strongly reduced B-cell numbers in na\u00efve mice.

This reduction in the numbers of MZ B cells in CEACAM1-deficient mice is also found in mice and humans lacking the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp)53. WASp is also involved in BTK phosphorylation54. As we have shown for CEACAM1, the necessity for WASp in the generation of the MZ B-cell compartment is B-cell intrinsic55.

For analysis, expression levels of target genes were normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 18S r-RNA (Qiagen), or both as an internal control gene (\u0394Ct). Gene expression values were then calculated with the \u0394\u0394Ct method; the mean of four untreated WT B cells (0 h after sorting) was used as a calibrator to which all other samples were compared. Relative quantities (RQs) were determined with the equation RQ=2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct.",
