The ALI caused by influenza infection can facilitate bacterial superinfection, which is a major factor that promotes mortality and disease severity [3]. From 2003 to 2016, highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza virus has caused 856 human infection cases worldwide with a high mortality rate of 52.8% (http://101.96.8.164/www.who.int/entity/influenza/human_animal_interface/2017_01_16_tableH5N1.pdf). Currently, China is undergoing its fifth epidemic of human infections of avian H7N9 influenza virus. Until 16 January 2017, 918 H7N9-infected human cases with at least 359 deaths have been reported to World Health Organization (http://101.96.8.165/www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/Influenza_Summary_IRA_HA_interface_01_16_2017_FINAL.pdf?ua=1). With high mutation and reassortment rates, influenza viruses have evolved with a rapid resistance to the current vaccines and anti-viral drugs, making an avian influenza pandemic an urgent unresolved threat to human health [4\u20136].",

            "text": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was firstly identified from human cardiac left ventricle complementary DNA (cDNA) library and lymphoma cDNA library by two separate groups [7, 8]. ACE2 inactivates angiotensin II (Ang II) by cleaving it to produce Ang 1\u20137 [9]. Ang II binds to the Ang II type 1 and type 2 receptors with strong affinity, mediating regulation of blood pressure, body fluid balance, inflammation, cell proliferation, hypertrophy and fibrosis [10\u201312]. Reduced expression levels of ACE2 have been reported in hypertension and chronic kidney disease [13, 14]. In addition, ACE2 was identified as a key regulator of dietary amino-acid homeostasis and gut microbial ecology [15]. We previously demonstrated that ACE2 counteracts the development of severe ALI or ARDS induced by avian influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus spikes, sepsis and acid aspiration in mice [16\u201318]. Administration of recombinant ACE2 or the Ang II receptor blocker losartan can ameliorate H5N1 virus infection-induced ALI [16, 19]. Moreover, ACE2 was also reported to have a protective role in respiratory syncytial virus-induced lung injury [20]. Notably, plasma Ang II levels can indicate disease severity in H7N9 infections [21]. Downregulation of ACE2 appears to be a shared phenomenon in ALI or ARDS induced by viral or bacterial infection [18, 22\u201325].",

Moreover, elevated levels of miR-200c-3p were found in plasma samples of severe pneumonia patients. Our in vivo results demonstrated that miR-200c-3p may be a therapeutic target for ALI.",

With 978 human miRNAs at a meaningful level (read count>0), we listed the top 20 highly expressed miRNAs in H5N1-infected cells compared with H1N1-infected cells (Figure 1a). Among them, miR-200c-3p and miR-141-3p were predicted to target ACE2 using TargetScan (Supplementary Figure S1a). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis confirmed the upregulation of miR-200c-3p and miR-141-3p in H5N1-infected A549 cells (Figure 1b and c). Moreover, we observed that the expression of miR-421, which was reported to target ACE2 [31], was not upregulated after H1N1 and H5N1 virus infection (Supplementary Figure S1b). The pattern of the upregulation of miR-200c-3p and miR-141-3p was also validated in HEK293T cells (human embryonic kidney cells) (Supplementary Figure S1c and d). Additionally, the ACE2 protein expression levels were downregulated in A549 cells (Supplementary Figure S1e) and HEK293T cells (Supplementary Figure S1f) after infection with H5N1 influenza virus, which were consistent with our previous observations in the H5N1-infected mice lung tissues [16].",

Then, we tested the effect of the different multiplicity of infection (MOI) on the expression of miR-200c-3p and miR-141-3p. A549 cells were challenged with H5N1 virus at different viral titers (MOI=0.05, 0.5 and 5), and the expression of miR-200c-3p and miR-141-3p was detected. The larger the infective dose administered, the higher the expression of miR-200c-3p and miR-141-3p (Supplementary Figure S1i). Successful viral infection was confirmed by detecting the expression of matrix protein 1 (M1) (Supplementary Figure S1j).

However, we did not observe any significant change of ACE2 expression in the group transfected with miR-141-3p mimics or inhibitors. Previously, miR-141-3p has been reported to regulate tumor growth factor-\u03b22 by targeting its transcript during H5N1 infection [32]. To demonstrate the interaction between miR-200c-3p and ACE2 transcripts, we constructed a reporter vector in which the 3\u2032-UTR of ACE2 was fused downstream of Renilla luciferase coding sequence (Supplementary Figure S2a). In HEK293T cells transfected with miR-200c-3p mimics rather than miR-200c-5p mimics, Renilla luciferase activity significantly decreased (Figure 2b). Successful transfection of miR-200c-3p mimics and miR-200c-5p mimics was confirmed by qRT-PCR (Supplementary Figure S2b). Additionally, the activity was inhibited by miR-200c-3p mimics in a concentration-dependent manner (Supplementary Figure S2c). When the predicted miR-200c-3p binding site on ACE2 3\u2032-UTR was deleted, the inhibiting effects of miR-200c-3p mimics on the luciferase activity were diminished (Figure 2c). Moreover, mutation of the site on miR-200c-3p binding to ACE2 3\u2032-UTR abolished the inhibiting effects of miR-200c-3p on Renilla luciferase activity (Supplementary Figure S2d). Taken together, these results indicate that miR-200c-3p, rather than miR-200c-5p and miR-141-3p, directly targets the 3\u2032-UTR of ACE2 and downregulates the expression of ACE2 protein.",

In HEK293T cells transfected with NS1 expressing vector, the upregulation of miR-200c-3p and miR-141-3p was observed (Figure 2d and Supplementary Figure S3a). In addition, M1 and NP also induced the upregulation of miR-200c-3p. However, NS1 induced a much higher level of miR-200c-3p than M1 and NP. Therefore, in the subsequent experiments, we focused on the function of NS1. Compared with the NS1 of H1N1 virus, the NS1 of H5N1 and H7N9 viruses induced much higher expression of miR-200c-3p and miR-141-3p (Figure 2e and Supplementary Figure S3b). However, NS1 of neither H5N1 nor H7N9 caused any significant change of the expression of miR-421 (Supplementary Figure S3c). Transfection of H5N1-NS1 and H7N9-NS1 expression vectors into HEK293T cells resulted in the downregulation of ACE2 protein levels (Figure 2f).

In addition, transfection of poly (I:C) also resulted in the downregulation of ACE2 protein expression, which was rescued by the transfection of inhibitors of miR-200c-3p (Figure 3d), indicating that downregulating ACE2 protein expression by miR-200c-3p may be a shared mechanism for RNA viruses. Induction of interleukin-6, interleukin-29 and interferon-\u03b2 by poly (I:C) was confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis (Supplementary Figure S4a). Previous studies have reported that LPS, which is the major constituent of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, can induce the downregulation of ACE2 and the upregulation of Ang II [33, 34]. However, the mechanisms are still unclear. By exposing A549 and THP1 cells (human acute monocytic leukemia cell line) to LPS, we found that LPS can induce the upregulation of miR-200c-3p (Figure 3b and Supplementary Figure S5a). LPS treatment also induced the downregulation of ACE2 protein expression (Figure 3e and Supplementary Figure S5c). Compared with inhibitors of negative control (NC), transfection of miR-200c-3p inhibitors significantly inhibited the downregulation of ACE2 induced by LPS (Figure 3e). Interestingly, LTA, which is the major component of the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria, can also induce the upregulation of miR-200c-3p (Figure 3c and Supplementary Figure S5b) and the downregulation of ACE2 (Figure 3f and Supplementary Figure S5d) in A549 and THP1 cells. Consistently, the downregulation of ACE2 protein was markedly inhibited by the transfection of miR-200c-3p inhibitors (Figure 3f). In poly (I:C)-treated cells, another miRNA previously reported targeting to ACE2 gene, miR-421, was measured slightly upregulated, whereas in LPS- and LTA-treated A549 cells, no significant changes of miR-421 were observed (Figure 3a\u2013c). Induction of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-6 and interleukin-1\u03b2 by LPS and LTA in A549 and THP1 cells were confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis (Supplementary Figure S4b and c and Supplementary Figure S5e and f). Collectively, our results suggest that miR-200c-3p is a crucial regulator of ACE2 protein expression in the above conditions and may be shared in certain types of viral and bacterial infections.",

            "text": "Viruses and bacteria are usually the precipitating factors of severe pneumonia, which may induce severe respiratory failure by triggering ARDS [35, 36], a clinical syndrome characterized by pulmonary edema, hypoxemia and the accumulation of inflammatory cells [1]. ARDS has a high mortality rate of 30\u201350%, thus demanding accurate prediction models [37, 38]. Because H5N1 virus, poly (I:C), LPS and LTA can all induce the expression of miR-200c-3p to downregulate ACE2 protein expression, we speculate that the expression of miR-200c-3p may be aberrant in severe pneumonia infection. To investigate whether miR-200c-3p is involved in severe pneumonia infection, we collected plasma from 56 severe pneumonia patients and 21 healthy volunteers and then detected the expression of miR-200c-3p in the plasma. The characteristics of the study subjects are shown in Supplementary Table S1. Of the 56 patients, 53 (94.64%) fulfilled ARDS criteria [39]. In accordance with our speculation, the plasma levels of miR-200c-3p were significantly elevated in severe pneumonia patients (Figure 3g). Downregulation of ACE2 may result in the elevated plasma level of Ang II, which is a major substrate of ACE2. Additionally, Ang II is claimed considerably increased in ARDS patients [40]. Consistent with this report, the plasma levels of Ang II were also markedly upregulated in severe pneumonia patients (Figure 3h). Notably, the plasma level of Ang II changed over miR-200c-3p in severe pneumonia patient (patient 48th) whose plasma samples were consecutively collected (Figure 3i), suggesting that miR-200c-3p may participate in the upregulation of plasma Ang II and then induces lung injury through Ang II type 1 receptor. Consequently, our results raise the possibility that miR-200c-3p can serve as a biomarker or therapeutic target for severe pneumonia.",

Besides, the determinant role of NF-\u03baB in the regulation of miRNA expression has been revealed by previous studies [43\u201345]. It is well known that the activation of NF-\u03baB signaling is essential in H5N1 infection and propagation [46\u201348]. Disabling the function of NF-\u03baB heterodimer with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (si-p65 and si-p50) or its specific inhibitors, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) and JSH-23, we found that the induction of miR-200c-3p by H5N1 infection was significantly repressed (Figure 4a and b and Supplementary Figure S6a). Considering that NS1 was reported to inhibit NF-\u03baB activation, we proposed that there is an NF-\u03baB-dependent manner for influenza virus to induce the expression of miR-200c-3p besides NS1-mediated induction of miR-200c-3p [49]. As influenza A virus infection-generated single-stranded viral RNA (vRNA) can be recognized by RIG-I to activate NF-\u03baB and induce multiple gene expressions [43], we transfected RNA extracted from H5N1-infected cells (H5N1-vRNA) into A549 cells with Lipofectamine 2000 to test whether vRNA can induce the upregulation of miR-200c-3p. Interestingly, we found that transfection of H5N1-vRNA significantly elevated the expression level of miR-200c-3p compared with transfection of RNA extracted from AF-treated cells (Supplementary Figure S6b). In addition, repressing the function of NF-\u03baB heterodimer with siRNAs (si-p65 or si-p50) or its specific inhibitors (CAPE and JSH-23) also resulted in the inhibition of the upregulation of miR-200c-3p induced by H5N1-vRNA transfection (Figure 4c and d and Supplementary Figure S6c), suggesting that H5N1-vRNA-induced expression of miR-200c-3p requires NF-\u03baB activation.",

Inhibition of miR-200c-3p significantly blocked the downregulation of ACE2 protein induced by H5N1 virus infection (Supplementary Figure S7a). ARDS induced by H5N1 virus in mice was used to mimic and investigate the pathogenesis of H5N1-induced human ARDS [53]. H5N1 virus infection results in lung edema, inflammatory cellular infiltration and lung injury in mice [53]. Our results showed that the expression of miR-200c-3p in the lung tissue of H5N1-infected mice was also markedly upregulated (Figure 5a). Previously, we reported that the expression of ACE2 protein was downregulated in H5N1-infected mouse lung tissue [16]. As inhibition of miR-200c-3p resulted in recovery of ACE2 protein level in H5N1-infected A549 cells, miR-200c-3p may be a therapeutic target for H5N1-infected mice. In fact, administration of miR-200c-3p antagomir (24 h before, 6 and 24 h after infection, intraperitoneally 10 mg kg\u22121) indeed improved wet-to-dry lung tissue weight ratio, which indicates the degree of lung edema (Figure 5b). In mice administered with miR-200c-3p antagomir, lung injury scores (including alveolar wall thickening, hyaline membranes formatting and airspaces filling with proteinaceous debris) [54] were decreased, and inflammatory cell infiltration was alleviated (Figure 5c). Moreover, administration of miR-200c-3p antagomir (1, 24 and 48 h after infection, intraperitoneally 20 mg kg\u22121) markedly improved the survival rate of mice infected with H5N1 virus (Figure 5d) and restrained the viral replication in the lungs (Figure 5e and Supplementary Figure S7b). The body weight loss of surviving H5N1-infected mice administered with miR-200c-3p antagomir was recovered (Supplementary Figure S7c). Administration of miR-200c-3p antagomir also resulted in the recovery of ACE2 protein level in the lung tissue (Figure 5f). Accordingly, treatment with miR-200c-3p antagomir markedly reduced the plasma level of Ang II of H5N1-infected mice as well (Figure 5g). In summary, our data demonstrated that inhibiting the function of miR-200c-3p improves lung injury and ARDS induced by H5N1 virus infection, rendering miR-200c-3p as a potential therapeutic target.",

Our previous studies have demonstrated that ACE2 protects mice against ALI induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus spikes, acid aspiration, sepsis and avian influenza virus [16, 18]. In this study, we showed that avian influenza virus, poly (I:C), bacterial LPS and LTA use a similar approach to reduce ACE2 level: the elevated miR-200c-3p directly downregulates ACE2 expression. Moreover, plasma levels of miR-200c-3p and its downstream effector Ang II were significantly elevated in severe pneumonia patients.",

Interestingly, here we found that pathogenic avian influenza virus can induce the upregulation of miR-200c-3p through both the expression of NS1 protein and the accumulation of vRNA (Figure 6). NS1 is a multifunctional protein that interacts with more than 50 proteins to regulate innate immune pathways, splicing and mRNA export [57, 58]. Unlike NS1 of human pandemic H1N1/2009, NS1 of avian highly pathogenic H5N1 effectively inhibits the polyadenylation of cellular pre-mRNA in A549 cells [59]. Batista et al. [60] have shown that the transcription of miR-200c/141 can be induced by the bypass of the usual PTPN6 polyadenylation. NS1 of pathogenic avian influenza viruses may induce the expression of miR-200c-3p and miR-141-3p by bypassing the usual PTPN6 polyadenylation, which needed to be further investigated. Moreover, a study has reported that NA protein of influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1, PR8) can downregulate ACE2 [61]; therefore, whether NA of H5N1 and H7N9 viruses can downregulate ACE2 requires further investigation.",

Viruses, bacteria, parasites and injury initiate distinct signal-transduction pathways to activate NF-\u03baB. Influenza virus can induce the activation of NF-\u03baB by the accumulation of viral products, including viral protein and vRNA [62, 63]. In this study, we found that transfection of RNA extracted from H5N1 virus-infected cells elicited the upregulation of miR-200c-3p, which can be suppressed by the loss of p65 function (Figure 6). However, the detailed molecular mechanism needs to be further investigated. The expression levels of miR-200c-3p have been found to be markedly upregulated in the livers of hepatocellular carcinoma patients [64]. Among these patients, nine patients were diagnosed with HBV infection and five patients were diagnosed with HCV infection, thus suggesting that HBV and HCV infection may induce the expression of miR-200c-3p. Whether HCV or HBV RNA can induce the upregulation of miR-200c-3p requires further study.",

In fact, we also noticed that poly (I:C), bacterial LPS and LTA can induce the upregulation of miR-200c-3p to downregulate ACE2 protein expression in an NF-\u03baB signaling pathway-dependent manner (Figure 6). Previous study has shown that overexpression of ACE2 protects against LPS-induced lung injury in rat [23]. The downregulation of ACE2 might be mediated by miR-200c-3p and inhibition of miR-200c-3p might protect against LPS-induced lung injury as well.
