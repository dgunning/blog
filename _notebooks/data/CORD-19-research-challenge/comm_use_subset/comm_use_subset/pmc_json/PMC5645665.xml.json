In response, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued warnings of the potential of serious disease through animal-to-human transmission, and expressed concern that once a pandemic had started, it would be too late to undertake many of the activities required to minimise its impact [3]. These threats of an imminent pandemic constituting a \u2018Public Health Emergency of International Concern\u2019 led to the publication of guidelines to assist its member states to prepare for a new pandemic in 1999 [3].",

Prior to this, there was an incident in Ntchisi, central region of the country in December 2005, where thousands of sick migratory birds (fork-tailed drongos) dropped dead from the sky, precipitating fear of an avian flu outbreak in the country. The large wetlands around the Lake of Malawi provide a high risk of HPAI, creating an ideal breeding ground for the avian virus in seasonal migratory birds. As a result of these threats, an avian preparedness team was established, led by the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) and supported by the Ministry of Health (MoH).",

The national plan, confirmed in 2006, was based on existing operational structures at the national level, including health service infrastructure, health committees, surveillance networks and coordination, and command structures. In the implementation plan, for example, district hospitals were designated to manage influenza cases, rather than all cases being referred to Influenza Assessment Centres (IACs).",

The first recognised case of 2009 H1N1 influenza was officially declared in mid-April 2009 in Mexico, by which time the influenza virus had been actively spreading for some months. The 2009 pandemic influenza was mild but fatal in children, pregnant women and people with underlying chronic illness. Epidemiological data on 2009 pandemic influenza in Malawi is scarce and during the 2009 pandemic influenza no death related to influenza was reported. The lack of reporting reflects underreporting and how poorly the infection was understood. Pandemic influenza is a global threat, and killed over 50 million people globally in 1918.",

The taskforce met regularly to discuss and provide scientific advice on the management strategies and operational emergency responses required should a pandemic be declared in Malawi. Despite these meetings, and the existence of a formal plan, progress towards influenza preparedness across the country was slow, with the MoH facing numerous practical challenges [7]. These included the lack of an effective influenza surveillance system to send early signals of impending influenza activity in human and animal populations, and the lack of mechanisms to provide information to health services at the district level for the prevention, treatment and control of influenza. These operational challenges raised concerns about whether specific responses to planning for and response to pandemic influenza (PRPI), as characterised in the national plan, were achievable. This problem was not unique to Malawi [7].",

However, little is known of how Malawi translated its national influenza plan into response actions, or the success of these responses. To our knowledge, the study we report here is the first to investigate the planning for and responses to the 2009 pandemic influenza in a low income country, where governance, infrastructure and health systems might all compromise health outcomes. In this article, we focus on the challenges and operational problems Malawi encountered. We draw on interviews conducted with policymakers involved in PRPI to broaden our understanding of country preparedness and the outcomes of the responses. We conclude by identifying areas where preparedness and future responses might be improved.",

The country has an estimated population of 17.2 million (2015), and while characterised as a developing market economy, it is consistently among the poorest nations in the world, with a GDP of around USD 900 per capita per annum. Health expenditure per capita per annum is around USD 29 (2014), accounting for 8.4% of total percentage of GDP; this amount is insufficient to meet the costs of essential health services provided by the MoH. The health system is therefore dependent on donor aid and there is no public social health insurance system. As a least-resourced country, Malawi provides a significant case study to assess how severely limited budgets constrain pandemic preparations and the response actions that arise from such efforts.",

A question guide for a relatively unstructured interview was adopted, enabling the interviewer to cover essential points, while modifying the order of questions depending on the context and flow of conversation. This method provided flexibility for respondents to critique, comment, explain and share their experiences, opinions and attitudes as they wished. The interview guide included the following questions: (1) How would you describe the influenza preparedness plan before 2009? (2) How did you translate the pandemic plan into response actions during the 2009 pandemic outbreak? (3) What were the main operational problems, challenges and lessons learnt from the 2009 pandemic? and (4) How did you resolve problems during the 2009 pandemic? Before each interview, the researcher introduced himself and explained the purpose of the interview. Interview duration varied but ranged from 48 to 145 minutes (mean 70). Extended interviews afforded us in-depth data rather than breadth data that would cover all themes. This enabled us to build a convincing analytical narrative [17].

Note taking was repeated after full transcription, during the coding of the data, and again at the time of writing.

We used the six thematic areas of preparedness and responses set out in the WHO checklist [18] as a framework of analysis to identify respondents\u2019 views on the levels of preparedness, responses, strengths and weakness. These included planning and coordination, surveillance, communication, public health interventions, patient management and maintaining essential services. With these thematic areas in mind, coding was adopted, with the text examined closely, line by line, to identify both pre-defined and new themes. Generating codes involved three stages. The first was open coding, where interesting features of the data were identified, labelled and defined. Initial codes matching data extracts were collated by labelling and assigning a selection of unique identifiers of text within each data item. The second phase proceeded by reviewing and refining themes in which the connections between concepts (such as planning and public health infrastructure) were explored to help build categories and interrelationships. Here, we considered whether predefined themes and sub-themes formed a coherent pattern and if not, whether this was problematic. Themes that did not fit particular data extracts were redefined or discarded. The third phase involved searching selective coding, where predefined themes were further defined and refined. Throughout the process, codes identified in the data, predefined themes and categories were subjected to an iterative process, involving constant testing of data, confirming or negating the concepts, until the patterns in the data were clearly understood. This provided structure to the extracted data and interpretation in the final analysis.",

Malawi also participated in the deployment of H1N1 vaccines funded by the WHO and other donors, an action not part of the initial preparedness plan but incorporated in response to donor recommendations. As part of the response, Malawi established influenza surveillance at ports of entry, with routine checks for suspected cases, and suspected samples were sent to Kenya for diagnostic confirmation. Hence, as one participant remarked, \u2018despite the lack of labs, we managed to set up surveillance networks within the country and this paid off by picking up four confirmed cases\u2019 (P21).

Preparedness prior to 2009 H1N1 had failed to account for other influenza viruses subtypes, such as H1, H2, H3, H7 or H9, although most policymakers believed these subtypes posed pandemic risks too.

However, in Malawi, key infrastructure was severely limited, hence the use of diagnostic laboratories in Kenya. Establishing new infrastructure such as laboratories during emergency situations is practically impossible, given that this would take several years. For most respondents, the only way to achieve responses that mirrored preparedness plans was to improve health services generally, but essential services to facilitate rapid diagnostic, care and monitoring of disease spread all needed strengthening. A few respondents identified existing infrastructures, such as the Health Management Information System (HMIS), an information technology system that could have been deployed and adapted to provide timely information on influenza outbreaks. Respondents across the interviews were aware that having a functional information technology system would ensure the easy flow of information about the pandemic outbreaks, specifically to inform public health policy about, for example, whether additional staff were needed. Several suggested linking this with the integrated disease surveillance response (IDSR) system for management of health information, including planning for and management of health services.",

In reflecting on the implications of this for continued country capacity to respond to pandemics, respondents argued that there was a need for a national influenza centre and/or regional IACs to carry out monitoring and assessment: \u2018To respond effectively, we need an influenza virology laboratory. This will assist with virus isolation and subtyping of the virus\u2019 (P1).

The 2009 HIN1 pandemic influenza arrived sooner than was expected, and the plan was activated in April 2009 with inadequate time for influenza drills, exercises and simulations to test the plan. Surveillance at the time, however, included only screening for possible influenza cases at country borders. Activities were incomplete prior to and during the pandemic, and were characterised by poor reporting, lack of surveillance systems and infrastructure. Adequate reporting would have required building the capacity of the virology reference laboratory to conduct appropriate tests and collect appropriate and timely data to characterise the epidemic by person, place and time. This can be done through influenza web-based reporting systems and where possible, the use of rapid test technology in rural areas to capture real time surveillance data.",

A number of important weaknesses were identified in the robustness of influenza surveillance systems intended to send early signals for health service response, including the lack of efficient and timely decision-making among policymakers to guide public health policy on influenza. The WHO recommends reinforcement of routine surveillance capacity both from an epidemiological and virological standpoint to monitor influenza. This requires collection of sickness reports combined with laboratory and clinical investigations as valuable indicators of the occurrence of influenza. It is essential to monitor for influenza-like illnesses (ILI), including severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) during influenza season and non-season periods. Unless these ILI and SARI are characterised and monitored, policymakers will not be well informed on the burden of respiratory diseases in order to prioritise resources and plan public health interventions to mitigate influenza infections. Institutions within existing systems, such as hospitals and laboratories, need to document and assess influenza data. This can be undertaken using surveillance techniques such as reporting ILI or SARI, and absenteeism in work place and schools.",

At the same time, pandemic influenza is a serious threat, with a large population at risk of infection in a relatively short period of time. Even mild to moderate illness in the population can significantly disrupt social life and economic activities, with one study suggesting that pandemic influenza could reduce GDP by 0.5\u20134.3% [22]. A WHO study conducted in Thailand, Uganda and South Africa, for example, suggested that the 2009\u20132010 pandemic influenza contributed to a GDP loss of up to 0.05% of these countries [23]. In many respects, where resources are limited, pandemic influenza can be responded to in the same way as seasonal influenza and other respiratory infections such as TB. However, if PRPI is to be sustainable and sensitive to context, there is a need for internal funding and the development of command structures that do not heavily rely on external funding. Business continuity planning is required by both health and non-health sectors to complement and consolidate national plans, and to ensure continuation of the vital day-to-day functions of the society. For example, a business plan in the health sector may need to consider alternative power sources, if routine supplies affect operations due to constant surges, blackouts, and/or chronic shortages of fuel.",

Proper assessment of the pandemic risk is needed in any context to alert decision-makers to issues related to timely response and guidance on public health policy on influenza. Due to the lack of country funds for the PRPI, policymakers fully endorsed and adopted the WHO universal guidelines on pandemic influenza, without taking into account the local context. We argue that it is not possible to simply apply a graded series of responses to emerging pandemic viruses; this requires the Pandemic Severity Index (PSI) to be calibrated to the case fatality ratio to determine actions ranging from limited to stringent measures [24].",

However, these activities continued only for a short period and were then suspended due to lack of funding. Such decisions highlight the need for consistent public health actions to aid early detection and control. Difficulties in governance reflect inadequate preparedness for a number of planning activities, including vaccination and behaviour communication.

According to Vaughan and Tinker, the success of planning for and responding to pandemic influenza rests clearly on three inter-related themes \u2013 information, education and communication [25].

While financial and human resources are also needed to operate surveillance activities that support regular diagnoses of influenza and monitoring seasonal-like influenza through sentinel surveillance and laboratory tests, setting up and managing a good surveillance system for influenza in Malawi would not be a small task. Thus we suggest a number of cheap alternative types of surveillance could be used to survey and monitor influenza. For example, Outpatient Illness Surveillance was not emphasised by authorities in clinics or hospitals, and no information was stored or collected on flu patients visiting these institutions prior to the pandemic. No efforts were made to engage with alternative providers, which might have been critical had hospitals and clinics been overwhelmed with an unusually high number of patients. Preparedness plans need to take account of how the health sector can engage with different publics, traditional healers or volunteers from non-health sectors to reduce the demand and burden of patient care in case of surge turnout in crisis situations.",

Consistent with findings by Ortu and colleagues [7] of pandemic plans elsewhere in Africa, there were serious gaps and mistakes in government efforts, priorities and service objectives impacting PRPI, and little political will from politicians. For example, the planning process laid out a one-off budget system as a cheap option for response activities, but, as argued in an editorial in Nature, this is an unsustainable way to address pandemic threats in the 21st century [27]. The 57th WMA General Assembly held in South Africa emphasised that the importance of political will to fund public health preparedness is paramount to dealing with pandemic threats [28].",

There are also concerns about how much they intrude on personal liberties. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in Malawi, people were forcibly vaccinated [31], despite evidence that voluntary vaccination, quarantine and isolation is possible and effective. A study in Canada found these measures were effective in Toronto during the SARS outbreak when over 27,000 affected persons were asked by public health officers to accept quarantine measures and the populace cooperated [32]. Gostin and Berkman argue that effective communication is critical for gaining public trust and participation in community containment measures [33], as would be needed for volunteer vaccination.

Although discrepancies are expected in any pandemic planning nationally or internationally due to the uncertainty associated with pandemics, it is important to have a consistent basis for planning, especially if it is to be applied at both local and national levels. While Malawi developed communication strategies, strengthened influenza surveillance and updated overall goals in PRPI, most response actions addressing the 2009 pandemic failed to achieve the important public health goals that the plans set out. We found that the national pandemic plan was not updated regularly and experts in influenza emergency management were rarely consulted. A number of gaps in national action were also identified, including poor coordination between national policymakers with local stakeholders, weak leadership in the influenza working committee and lack of surveillance structures such as IACs and diagnostic laboratories. There is need for coordination between the private and public sectors in order to continue providing essential services such as water, energy and safe transport. Cooperation on influenza activities would reinforce the implementation of PRPI, but this would require that responsibilities and actions are defined phase by phase. Influenza research focusing on the national and local context is important to manage challenges and problems that might be experienced during the influenza outbreak. In addition, there is need for political interventions to improve pharmaceutical logistics which in turn would improve the availability of vaccines and other drugs, enabling people to be vaccinated on time during seasonal and pandemic periods. However, there is also a need to ensure that the public is aware that influenza is a reportable disease. Most importantly, there is a need to upgrade laboratory networks and diagnostic capacity, to include active sentinel surveillance through the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) and other operational structures like FluNet. In general, PRPI operations can be strengthened through effective IEC activities such as communicating real time surveillance data or communicating the nature, spread, peak and decline of influenza (both seasonally and during pandemics) to the general public. This can be done by electronic means, phones and meetings. The regular dissemination of such information may change public attitudes and perceptions about influenza.",

Scott has suggested that emergency management begin at the local level because disasters are local [35]. In this study, policymakers identified finances as barriers to planning, and while we appreciate the significance of what money does, PRPI cannot be determined only by its budget. A number of financial agreements may need to be established with developmental partners in order to strengthen capacity in areas such as education and to resource laboratory surveillance.

Simulation exercises would be a particularly valuable tool to improve preparedness to ensure that specific tasks, functions and skills are met in real pandemic scenarios. Simulation exercises act as a policy tool that informs policymakers to take proactive and timely actions as part of response measures. A PRPI model that also takes into consideration the \u2018prevention of ethical problems\u2019 will enable policymakers to evaluate interventions that may maintain operational readiness during a pandemic. Most importantly, lessons could be drawn regarding the need to strengthen health systems for district health service planning in compliance with infection control standards and PRPI themes such as communication, monitoring and surveillance, and prevention. The best way to respond effectively to a pandemic is to prepare for the worst. Being prepared for, and responding to, influenza pandemics requires having well-trained epidemiologists, a functional public health service, reliable surveillance system, laboratories, and efficient communication channels.
