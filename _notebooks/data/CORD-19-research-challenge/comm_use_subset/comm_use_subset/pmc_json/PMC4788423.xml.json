            "text": "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading infectious cause of death worldwide. Respiratory viruses, whose pathogen role have been underestimated for many years, account for more than 22% of adult CAP cases [1, 2]. Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses, ubiquitous in the environment, and are also a common cause of respiratory infections. HAdV pneumonia typically is limited to newborns, immunocompromised hosts, and school or military camp populations [3]. Severe HAdV pneumonia has been frequently described in immunocompromised patients. Respiratory infection caused by HAdV in immunocompetent patients is usually thought to be mild and self-limited. However, with advances in modern molecular techniques, HAdV has been increasingly found to be involved in sporadic cases and outbreaks of severe CAP in healthy adults [4, 5].",

            "text": "To date, at least 69 HAdV genotypes have been recognized, and they are assigned to seven subgroups (A\u2013G) according to genetic, biophysical and biochemical characteristics [6]. Species B (HAdV-3, -7, -11, and -14) is the predominant HAdV specie associated with respiratory infections among adults. HAdV-55, a genotype recombination between HAdV-11 and HAdV-14, has been the reported cause of sporadic or outbreak events of CAP in Turkey [7], Singapore [8], Korea [9] and China from 2004. HAdV-55-related sequential outbreaks in several provinces and regions of China gained increased attention since 2006 [10\u201312]. As just one pathogen of CAP, HAdV accounts for 5% of adult CAP cases in northern China between 2010 and 2012, while HAdV-55 accounts for more than 40% of identified HAdV positive samples [2]. Comparative studies showed that the serotypes of HAdV may be one of the factors which determine the severity of adenoviral pneumonia. HAdV-55 was thought to be more closely associated with severe pneumonia as compared to other serotypes (HAdV-3, -7 and -14) [2]. Clinical understanding of severe CAP induced by HAdV-55 is still limited, though the pathogen has been fully characterized by whole-genome sequencing. Current knowledge of HAdV-55-induced severe pneumonia is mainly derived from single case reports or relatively small, single-center series.",

In our study, oseltamivir was used in all eight patients who received antiviral drugs, while ribavirin and gancyclovir were used in combination with oseltamivir in four and three patients, respectively. Ten out of 15 (66.7%) patients received adjuvant intravenous immunoglobulin for 3\u20135 days, while fourteen (93.3%) received corticosteroids for 3\u201310 days, including hydrocortisone or methylprednisolone. Hospital acquired pulmonary infections developed in seven cases, and Acinetobacter baumannii was the dominating pathogen. Four patients did not survive (26.7%). One case died of respiratory failure caused by ARDS and three other patients died of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome which mainly included respiratory failure and septic shock. The need for mechanical ventilation and/or vasopressors were similar between non-survivors and survivors. Length of ICU stay and duration of mechanical ventilation in non-survivors were less than that in survivors, but the differences were not significant.",

However, the proportion of HAdV CAP increased to 4.2%-5% in the following two years [2, 16], and HAdV-55 became the predominant culprit. HAdV-55 is thought to be closely associated with severe CAP, and the results of our study verified this phenomenon again. To the best of our knowledge, the number of patients needed mechanical ventilation (14 patients) in this report is significantly more than those of two to six cases in all recent investigations of HAdV-55 related severe CAP. Our study may provide some new understanding for clinical characteristics of HAdV-55 related severe CAP in immunocompetent adults.",

All patients presented with high fevers and cough. Common manifestations of HAdV infection such as diarrhea or conjunctivitis were not common in our patients. PSI scores, one of the most commonly used severity assessment tools for CAP, can also provide important prognostic information for HAdV-55 induced CAP [2]. In this report, absence of underlying diseases and abnormal laboratory findings such as decreased hematocrit, hyponatremia and hyperglycemia, highlight the contribution of abnormal respiratory rate and PaO2/FiO2 to the high values we saw in patients\u2019 PSI scores. Respiratory rate is an independent risk marker for in-hospital mortality of CAP [20]. Low CRP values are commonly considered to be associated with a less severe systemic inflammatory response, which should reflect a better prognosis. Interestingly, our data showed that among patients with ARDS caused by HAdV, a low initial serum CRP level at admission correlated to a fatal outcome. Interpretation of this result may be difficult, though a similar phenomenon was found in severe CAP caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae [21] and CAP patients with liver cirrhosis [22]. CRP is an acute phase protein, which is synthesized by the liver in response to tissue damage. It may be reasonable to speculate that severe HAdV CAP accompanied by slightly elevated CRP may indicate impairment of the protective inflammatory response.",

However, more and more research supports consolidation rather than interstitial infiltrates as the main imaging characteristic of adenovirus pneumonia in immunocompetent adults. To date, adenovirus is the only virus known to cause focal or lobar consolidation (the typical manifestation of bacterial pneumonia) as its main imaging abnormality. The initial image findings of adenovirus pneumonia, which resemble bacterial pneumonia may mislead diagnosis and treatment. As Gu concluded, single lobar or segmental consolidation was more common in patients without ARDS, while patients with ARDS had bilateral and multilobar lung consolidations [17]. Compared to survivors in this report, non-survivors had more extensive consolidations which correlated with respiratory rate and PaO2 /FiO2.",

Among patients needing mechanical ventilation in previous reports about severe HAdV-55 pneumonia, nine out of 22 (40.9%) cases died [2, 9, 17\u201319]. Early administration of cidofovir showed possible effect in six immunocompetent patients [9], but randomized controlled trials are lacking and cidofovir is not available in most hospitals in China. Mortality (26.7%) in our study is relatively low and corticosteroids were frequently used in this study. Adjuvant corticosteroids for CAP and ARDS remains controversial. Improved mortality and a good safety record for corticosteroids given to patients with severe CAP were seen by some meta-analyses [23\u201325]. However, corticosteroids have also been found to be an independent predictor of mortality or other poor outcomes in multiple studies of other viral pneumonias [26\u201328]. The effect of corticosteroids on severe HAdV CAP is still uncertain, although there have been a few case reports. One case of a fatal HAdV-3 pneumonia with hypercytokinemia, \u201cpulse\u201d methylprednisolone treatment resulted in the rapid amelioration of the patient\u2019s respiratory distress [29]. In a study focused on severe CAP caused by HAdV-55, 10 out of 18 patients received corticosteroids and total mortality was 5.9% [17]. However, given the small sample size and design of our non-controlled study, we can not conclude that corticosteroids are helpful in severe HAdV CAP.",
