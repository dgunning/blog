Caliciviruses cause a wide range of significant diseases in human and animals. At present, there are five recognized genera, i.e., Norovirus, Sapovirus, Lagovirus, Vesivirus, and Nebovirus with several additional candidate genera or species proposed and under evaluation by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) [1, 2] (http://www.caliciviridae.com/unclassified/unclassified.htm). In the Vesivirus genus, Vesicular exanthema of swine virus (VESV) and Feline calicivirus (FCV) are two species currently approved by ICTV. Several canine caliciviruses (CaCV) isolates have been identified and shown to be phylogenetically related to vesiviruses with features distinct from both VESV and FCV in phylogeny, serology and cell culture specificities. CaCV is a probable species in the Vesivirus genus, as stated by ICTV [2]. It is still unclassified to date and the evidence presented herein should facilitate the classification and acceptance of CaCV as a species of vesivirus.",

            "text": "Many viruses found in human and other animal species can also infect dogs asymptomatically or cause respiratory, digestive, neurologic and genital diseases with mild to severe symptoms. In response to the use of dogs in military services and laboratory studies, etiological studies of canine diseases were conducted in 1963\u20131978 at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) [3, 4]. In addition to several known canine viral pathogens [5, 6], four unidentified viruses were recovered in Walter Reed Canine Cells (WRCC) producing similar cytopathic effects (CPE). The isolates were not recognized by available human and dog reference virus antisera. Studies of their physicochemical properties and electron microscope observations identified the isolates as likely caliciviruses. Our recent whole genome sequencing of these canine isolates clearly identified them as vesiviruses and elucidated their genetic relationships to the other members of the Caliciviridae family. We herein report the viral isolation and characterization results, which were made in 1963\u20131978 canine diseases etiological study but were not published, and additional genomics analysis supporting the serological diversity of CaCV strongly suggesting that these isolates and similar CaCV are a unique species within Vesivirus genus [7\u20139].",

These findings indicate the isolates are non-enveloped RNA viruses with an estimated diameter of 30 nm. Isolates 3\u201368, L198 T and W191R were partially purified, negative stained and examined with the electron microscope. The viruses were non-enveloped, 42 nm, 36 nm and 30 nm in diameter respectively, which is similar to the 30 nm diameter of picornaviruses (Table 2). However, the isolated viruses have the cup-like surface structure typical of caliciviruses (Fig. 1) [18]. These characteristics are similar to the caliciviruses, e.g., feline calicivirus (FCV) [19], vesicular exanthema of swine virus (VESV) [20] and Norwalk-like virus (NLV, norovirus) [18].",

The phylogenetic position of the CaCV isolates were determined based on amino acid sequences of RdRP and VP1 (Fig. 2). Clearly the CaCV isolates A128T and L198 T are close to type I strain 48, while isolates 3\u201368 and W191R are close to type II strain 2117. These results showed that these CaCVs phylogenetically belong to genus vesivirus with clear separation from species FCV and VESV. The known CaCV strains and isolates possibly form two phylogenetic clades. Sequence divergences of CaCV from species FCV or VESV for both RdRP and VP1 proteins are closer to or larger than the distance between FCV and VESV (Table 3). Small genetic variations are seen among viruses within FCV and VESV species, with high amino acid identities of 92.5 \u00b1 1.9% and 93.4 \u00b1 1.6% for RdRP respectively. In contrast, CaCV viruses and San Miguel sea lion viruses (SMSV), despite the small number of identified isolates for each virus, are much more genetically diverse, with RdRP amino acid identities of 85.5 \u00b1 6.6% and 85.2 \u00b1 13.3% respectively. It is interesting that SMSV shared remarkable sequence identities with CaCV, having RdRP amino acid identities of 69.0 \u00b1 1.5% with type I viruses and 75.9 \u00b1 0.7% with type II viruses respectively, comparable to the identity of 72.0 \u00b1 0.7% between types I and II viruses. However, the VP1 sequences differ greatly between SMSV and CaCV, with identity of only 42.2 \u00b1 0.9%, compared to the 65.7% \u00b1 3.4% identity between types I and II viruses. This difference is comparable to the level of difference in VP1 proteins between species FCV and VESV.",

            "text": "Determination of each isolate\u2019s genome sequence clearly identified each isolate as a member of the vesivirus genus in the Caliciviridae family and phylogenetically separate from FCV and VESV species. CaCV apparently has two serologically distinct and genetically divergent types: type I which includes strains 48, isolates A128T and L198 T; and type II which includes strain Bari/212/07/ITA, isolates 3\u201368 and W191R as well as 2117 and several 2117-like vesiviruses. It is remarkable that CaCV type II viruses share very high amino acid identities for RdRP (98.7% \u00b1 0.5%), but substantially lower identities (87.5 \u00b1 3.2) for VP1. It is rational to speculate that the high divergence of VP1 associates with capsid structure variation, antigenic diversity and in consequence broadened host specificity. It has been shown that vesivirus 2117 has a capsid structure more similar to sapovirus and lagovirus than to vesiviruses and potentially alterations in receptor binding [32]. Vesivirus 2117 [7] and 2117-like viruses Allston 2008/US (GenBank accession GQ475302), Allston 2009/US (GQ475301) and Geel 2008/Belgium (GQ475301) were identified as viral contaminants causative of CPE in production line Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The origin of these viruses is unknown but possibly from dogs [33]. Vesivirus 2117 can readily grow and develop CPE in MDCK and CHO-K1 cells. CPE in BHK-21 is weak in the first passage and more obvious in the second passage [34]. In a previous study the virus propagated in CHO cells but not in other cells including MDCK and BHK [7]. In our study, isolates 3\u201368 and W191R were isolated from dogs and maintained in the WRCC dog cell line. Neither produced visible CPE in BHK-21 cultures in first passage. Isolates 3\u201368 and W191R have respective amino acid identities of 88.7% and 85.7% for VP1 with strain 2117. The divergence of capsid sequences may have contributed to the adaptation of strain 2117 to hamster cells. It is important that the strain 2117-like viruses from CHO cells at three different locations, i.e. Germany, USA and Belgium are significantly different from each other by 14.1 \u00b1 0.9% for VP1 proteins, a similar extent as the distances with other CaCV II viruses. The large heterogeneity of major capsid proteins of CaCV and the evidence of possible cross species infectivity indicates the potential zoonotic transmission of CaCV. Speculation of possible canine to human transmission is supported by the recent finding of Bari/212/07/ITA antibodies in 7.8% of human sera tested in Italy [35].",

CaCV antibodies against each isolate were found in acute sera from other dogs in each cohort and only one other dog with rising antibody titer (Table 1). The data clearly suggest the infections by CaCV occurred after the dogs arrived in their cohorts.",

Examination of the capsid genome of the four isolates and the 48 and 2117 strains reveals HVRs, i.e. nt429 to nt444 which may also be related to the antigenic differences among the newly reported genomes and possibly of significance in the development of specific neutralizing antibodies.",

The detailed analyses demonstrated the restricted cell tropism, antigenic diversity and genetic variation of the CaCV viruses. The genomes of the four isolates together with the previously reported canine 48 and Bari/212/07/ITA strains provide significant additional evidence to support the formation in the canine vesivirus genus of canine calicivirus (CaCV) species consisting of at least two clades/types. Identification of the antigenically distinct vesiviruses capable of growth in cell culture provides a valuable model for studying the role of specific neutralizing antibody in protection against infection and disease during calicivirus infections.",
