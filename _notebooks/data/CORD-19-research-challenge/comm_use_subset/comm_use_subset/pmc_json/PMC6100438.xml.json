Since chirality is a fundamental characteristic of nature, a large number of well-known therapeutic ingredients from natural products of TCMs are chiral. Here, one isomer possesses a desired therapeutic effect, whereas its paired enantiomer could be inactive or even have undesirable effects [2]. For example, S-ibuprofen, the first chiral drugs of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug approved in 1994, was over a 100-fold more potent as an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase 1 enzyme than R-ibuprofen [3]. Notably, 45 new drugs approved by the US food and Drug Administration in 2015 were single enantiomers, except for lesinurad [4]. For this reason, investigating the biological activities of specific enantiomers of chiral compounds in TCMs is becoming more important. Chiral analysis of the chemical constituents in TCMs is therefore urgent and desired.",

Isatidis and their chiral glucosinolates, such as epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, and R,S-goitrin, have attracted more attention due to their antiviral activity [11,12,13]. In our previous studies, the specific marker of R,S-goitrin has been used for quality evaluation of R. Isatidis and its granules, which has been recorded in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2015 Edition) [6,14,15]. R-goitrin and S-goitrin were separately transferred from epiprogoitrin and progoitrin via the effect of myrosinase and considered to be the most noteworthy glucosinolate-biotransformed products [16]. The contents of degradation products might be influenced by the procedures of traditional processing and extraction in crude drugs, decoction pieces, and granules of R. Isatidis [17]. Furthermore, the pharmacological properties of R. Isatidis is related to R-goitrin. The inhibitory effect of R-goitrin against influenza viral neuraminidase was revealed by fluorescent enzyme immunoassay method [11,13], while S-goitrin is known as an antithyroid factor [18].",

Several enantioselective chromatography such as reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) coupled with the type of Chrialpak\u00ae IC chiral column [19,20] and supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) have been used for chiral separation of R,S-goitrin in R. Isatidis [21,22]. However, these methods were limited owing to the complex operation, high cost, and lack of simultaneous quantification of other chiral glucosinolates.

Isatidis were performed using HPLC-UV-CD, which improved the limitation of high-cost chiral columns, complex operation of sample preparation, and simultaneous quantification of the characteristic glucosinolates. In the typical UV and CD chromatograms of R. Isatidis samples (Figure 1), R-goitrin and S-goitrin showed the same retention time, UV absorption feature, and overlapping peak. They could not be separated by UV detection without using the specific chiral columns (Figure 1A,B; upper). In contrast to that, R-goitrin and S-goitrin had completely opposite chromatographic profiles at the same retention time as shown in CD chromatograms (Figure 1A,B; lower). Notably, in the typical CD chromatograms, only R-goitrin could be detected in the mixed R,S-goitrin, crude drugs, decoction pieces, and granules of R. Isatidis. Therefore, the R-goitrin content could be quantified using CD detector, while the S-goitrin content was calculated using the mixed R,S-goitrin and the determined R-goitrin content. Combining the CD chromatographic properties with total content of the mixed R,S-goitrin, it provided an efficient method to determine the content of R-goitrin in the mixed R,S-goitrin without chiral separation.",
