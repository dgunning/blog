            "text": "Resveratrol (trans-3,4',5-trihydroxystilbene), a polyphenolic phytoalexin, is derived from some edible materials, including grape skins, peanuts, red wine, and other berries. It has been demonstrated that resveratrol displays diverse pharmacological activities, including anti-platelet [2], anti-carcinogenic [4], anti-viral [9, 18, 27] and cardio-protective effects [32, 33, 37, 43, 47]. Moreover, there is accumulating evidence indicating that resveratrol exhibits neuroprotective effects [8, 11, 23, 28]. For example, resveratrol attenuates kainic acid-mediated convulsions and the associated neurotoxicity [16, 42, 49, 54] and also protects against pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures [31, 40]. Furthermore, resveratrol has the ability to inhibit the electrical activity of neurons [26, 30, 50], enabling this compound ideal as a neuroprotective agent against excitatory effects on neurons. This compound can inhibit neuronal discharges in rat hippocampal CA1 area [25] and suppress epileptiform discharges mediated by glutamate [25]. In addition, resveratrol has the ability to produce a dose-dependent inhibition of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials [11]. These effects are likely associated with the alterations in neuronal cell membrane ion channel activities.",

Therefore, the present study examined the effects of resveratrol on BKCa currents and voltage-gated sodium currents by a voltage clamp setup in cortical neurons. Moreover, the effects of resveratrol on action potential firing rate and the BKCa channel inhibitor TEA (or paxilline)-induced hyperexcitability were also evaluated. Our data demonstrated that resveratrol activated BKCa channels, but inhibited voltage-gated sodium currents. Moreover, the action potential firing rates evoked by the depolarizing current and BKCa channel blockers were remarkably decreased by application of resveratrol. These results suggest that alterations of BKCa channel activity and sodium currents by resveratrol may contribute to its reducing effect on action potential firing rates of cortical neurons.",

The BKCa channel currents in response to resveratrol were examined in the condition of the extracellular solution containing TEA (1 mM), a BKCa channel blocker, to block BKCa channel currents. The net currents subtracted before and after treatment with BKCa channel blockers were defined as BKCa channel currents. For these experiments, the cells were depolarized from \u221250 to +70 mV. The amplitude of potassium outward current was measured at the end of the depolarizing pulses. The NS1619, a BKCa channel activator, was taken as a positive control.

When activated by cell membrane depolarization and elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration, BKCa channels allow the efflux of K+ out of the cell, thus repolarizing and hyperpolarizing the membrane potential. This turns off voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and thus inhibits the influx of Ca2+ into the cell. These negative feedback mechanisms allow BKCa channels to play an important role in regulating firing properties. BKCa channels are expressed in various brain neurons where they play important roles in regulating action potential duration, firing frequency and neurotransmitter release [34].

In particular, the Nav1.1, Nav1.2 and Nav1.6 sodium channels are expressed in cortical tissue [55], which are all TTX-sensitive [5]. Consistently, we found that the sodium currents recorded in the rat cortical neurons are totally blocked by TTX.

Inhibition of sodium currents by resveratrol may account for its analgesic effects [12, 14, 44]. The present study demonstrated that resveratrol can inhibit the TTX-S sodium currents in rat cortical neurons. Several lines of evidence revealed that the pathophysiology of both acquired and inherited epilepsy is associated with abnormal expression or function of voltage-gate sodium currents [29]. The Nav1.1 or Nav1.2 mutations are associated with generalized epilepsy and inherited epilepsy [6, 19]. Together with the observations that the protective effects of resveratrol against seizure activities caused by kainic acid or pentylenetetrazole [16, 45, 46, 48], our findings suggest that in addition to activation of BKCa channels, blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels in the cortical neurons might also contribute to the anti-seizure effects of resveratrol.",
