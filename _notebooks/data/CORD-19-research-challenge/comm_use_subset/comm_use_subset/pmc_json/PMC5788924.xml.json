As a member of the Poxviridae family the genus Orthopoxvirus (OPV) comprises complex enveloped DNA viruses, including the smallpox-causing Variola virus (VARV), Vaccinia virus (VACV), which was used for smallpox eradication7, and several animal-borne viruses with zoonotic potential like Cowpox virus (CPXV)8\u201310. Having caused the death of hundreds of millions of people, VARV is the most prominent member of OPV. Although VARV has been eradicated in 1979, it is still a global health threat because of its possible release in the context of a bioterrorist attack and the emergence of VARV-like viruses from circulating OPV by natural evolution11. CPXV are well suited to fill the niche that was created by VARV eradication, since it has the largest OPV genome including homologous open reading frames of all VARV genes. Currently, the number of zoonotic infections in Europe caused by CPXV is increasing, illustrating the need for a comprehensive understanding of the virus biology, especially the interaction with the host cell12,13.",

            "text": "In contrast to VACV, the role of the UPS during CPXV infection has been barely investigated so far. Treatment of CPXV-infected cells with proteasome inhibitors prevents late protein expression and reduces viral titers3 but it remains unknown to what extent results generated with VACV apply to CPXV. Hence, we aimed to characterize the role of ubiquitin and the UPS in CPXV infection in a more comprehensive way. We initially verified the inhibition of proteasome activity by MG-132 and Bortezomib in HeLa cells and excluded cytotoxic effects. Subsequently, we showed that proteasome inhibition impairs CPXV replication by prevention of viral core degradation, resulting in early but not in late viral protein expression. Therefore, we hypothesized that proteasomal degradation of K48-linked polyubiquitinated core proteins is the mechanism underlying CPXV uncoating, as previously suggested for VACV4. Since this hypothesis has not been verified yet, we aimed to prove it by conducting the first global LC-MS/MS-based ubiquitinome analysis of OPV IMV proteins. Using purified CPXV IMV particles, we identified 137 conserved ubiquitination sites in 54 viral proteins among five CPXV strains. As hypothesized, CPXV major core proteins were extensively ubiquitinated. But surprisingly, we were unable to detect their proteasome-dependent degradation upon infection. Instead, 54 other viral proteins were degraded in a proteasome-dependent manner early in infection, including all proteins associated with the formation of viral pre-replication sites23. Most notably, we detected the proteasomal degradation of the uncoating factor E5 (VACV D5), which is likely a prerequisite for OPV genome uncoating23.",

Both compounds inhibit primarily the chymotrypsin-like site of the 26 S proteasome but may also act on the caspase-like site in a concentration-dependent manner24. A complete inhibition of proteasome activity was only observed using 10 \u00b5M MG-132 and 1 \u00b5M Bortezomib, which represented the highest inhibitor concentrations tested (Fig. 1a). These concentrations have already been applied in previous studies, though proteasome inhibition has not been shown2,3. Analysis of the ATP amount revealed about 80% cell viability of inhibitor-treated cells after 24 h of treatment (Fig. 1b). Inhibitor-induced release of lactate dehydrogenase, as a measure of cytotoxicity, was below 5% (Fig. 1c), confirming acceptable conditions for infection experiments.",

Inhibition of late protein expression has only been shown using MG-1323, while inhibition of VF formation has not been shown for CPXV at all. HeLa cells infected with a recombinant CPXV strain expressing differently fluorescent proteins under control of an early and a late viral promotor revealed the absence of late protein expression in inhibitor-treated cells while early protein expression was still detectable (Fig. 3a). Additionally, VF were only detected in control cells with non-inhibited proteasome, while VF were absent in cells with inhibited proteasome (Fig. 3b). Taken together, we demonstrated that the effects of proteasome inhibition observed for VACV replication are transferable to CPXV.",

Furthermore, VF were found in 77% of cells with non-inhibited proteasome, while no VF were detected in MG-132-treated cells (Fig. 3c).

Using a confocal microscopy-based core stabilization assay, Satheshkumar and colleagues still observed 40\u201345% of uncoated cores in cells treated with MG-132. Although they additionally observed a more than 2-fold increase in intact virus cores in the presence of MG-132, they concluded that the inability of uncoating is not sufficient to account for the complete replication inhibition of VACV observed in proteasome-inhibited cells2. However, virus attachment to cells at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h without the presence of MG-132 prior to 37 \u00b0C incubation in the presence of proteasome inhibitor, as done by Satheshkumar and colleagues2, may result in uncoating even before complete proteasome inhibition is achieved. This may explain the observed 40\u201345% of uncoated cores in the presence of MG-1322. We still observed residual proteasome activity after 1 h of MG-132 treatment (data not shown) verifying this assumption and hence we pretreated cells for electron microscopy with proteasome inhibitor prior to infection. Confirming that proteasome inhibition prevents CPXV core degradation, we aimed to identify ubiquitination sites in structural core proteins, which are a prerequisite for their proteasome-dependent degradation. Therefore, we conducted the first global LC-MS/MS-based ubiquitinome analysis of virion proteins.",

Besides the cell culture-adapted CPXV strain Brighton Red (BR) representing the best-characterized CPXV strain, we analyzed four CPXV strains that were isolated between 2007 and 2009 in the German Consultant Laboratory for Poxviruses at the Robert Koch Institute, Germany. All of these four strains led to documented zoonotic infections. If the hypothesis of ubiquitinated core proteins is true, ubiquitination sites in corresponding proteins should be identifiable. Therefore, we purified CPXV mature virions by density gradient ultracentrifugation, lysed the purified particles and digested the proteins with trypsin.

As expected, the proportion of missed cleavages was greatly increased for peptides with diGly(K) residue since trypsin cleavage is prevented by diGly(K) remnants26. Furthermore, it was not surprising that about 58% of ubiquitinated peptides (based on peptide area quantification) originated from ubiquitin itself. Viral peptides made up 34% of ubiquitinated peptides while only 8% originated from the host or contaminants (Supplementary Table S2). Hence, ubiquitin is probably derived from viral rather than host proteins. The ubiquitin-like proteins ISG15 and NEDD8 also result in diGly(K) remnants after trypsin digestion26, but since these peptides together made up less than 0.2% of all peptide areas, diGly(K) residues were considered to be ubiquitin specific.",

All of the seven ubiquitin linkages possible were identified in all five CPXV strains, except for K33 which was not identified in the CPXV RatHei sample. Quantitative approximation of lysine linkages using peptide areas of linkage-specific ubiquitin peptides revealed K48-linked polyubiquitin as the most abundant ubiquitin linkage in CPXV IMV particles, with a mean of 53% of all ubiquitin linkages. K63 was identified to be the second-most abundant linkage, with a mean portion of 33% in CPXV mature virions. K11 and K6 represented about 8% and 4.5%, respectively, while K27 and K29 linkages made up less than 1% each (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table S3).

This supports the hypothesis of K48-linked polyubiquitinated core proteins. It should be noted that peptide area quantification of ubiquitin linkages relies on the comparison of non-identical peptides and hence represents only a rough approximation. Moreover, from our results, it is not possibly to determine the precise ubiquitination linkage of distinct virion proteins. However, in agreement with our results, Mercer and colleagues identified K48-linked polyubiquitin in VACV virion core fractions by Western blotting but, in contrast to our results, they were not able to detect K63-linked polyubiquitin chains4. This might be attributed to the lesser abundance of K63 linkages which may not be detectable using Western blot but it may also represent a biological difference between VACV and CPXV. It should be noted further that fractionation of purified IMV particles in core and membrane fraction by incubation with detergent and reduction agents4,20,30 as performed by Mercer and colleagues4 may result in incomplete separation since LBs may be still associated. Pederson and colleagues compared proteins of cores prepared with NP-40/DTT to those isolated from infected cells treated with actinomycin D which inhibits uncoating. Only the NP40/DTT-treated cores were positive for the LB protein F17, which indicates incomplete LB removal by NP40/DTT treatment25. Although LBs may be partially removed by trypsin digestion20, no conclusion can be drawn which distinct viral proteins are ubiquitinated when analyzing core and membrane fraction by immunoblot. The LC-MS/MS-based ubiquitinome analysis performed in this study enabled us to map ubiquitination sites in viral proteins precisely, with diGly(K) residues providing direct evidence of ubiquitination.",

Another eleven viral proteins contained ubiquitination sites in all five CPXV strains but no conserved lysine residues were identified (Supplementary Table S6). More than half of the 54 viral proteins with conserved ubiquitination sites contained one or two diGly(K) sites, while other proteins showed up to ten sites (Fig. 4b). As expected, proteins with conserved diGly(K) sites tended to be essential for virus replication (59.5%) and conserved in OPV (70.4%). In addition, most viral proteins with conserved ubiquitination sites belonged to the functional term host\u2013virus interaction and transcription but also proteins belonging to the core were identified (Fig. 4c). The identification of ubiquitination sites in CPXV proteins of diverse functions indicated an underestimated regulatory function of ubiquitin during OPV infection. Because the elucidation of ubiquitination sites in CPXV core proteins was a major objective of the present study, it is discussed in the following. Nevertheless, remarkable results were obtained for viral proteins of other functional classes. Our data, for example, indicates a ubiquitin-dependent transcriptional regulation of CPXV. Therefore, viral proteins with conserved ubiquitination sites that belong to functional classes other than the core are depicted in the Supplementary Discussion.",

A7 and N4 are known to locate inside the core, while A11, A4 and A5 are part of the outer core structure, making them likely targets for ubiquitination25,35.

A11 contained ten conserved diGly(K) sites and a mean of 20 diGly(K) sites, considering also non-conserved sites. Additionally, the major core protein A4 contained six conserved diGly(K) sites, ranking third-highest in the number of conserved ubiquitination sites.

Furthermore, distinct ubiquitination sites were elucidated in viral proteins which have been associated with ubiquitin before, but whose modification sites were previously unknown. However, there are some discrepancies between known ubiquitination sites in VACV and those identified in CPXV that may reflect species-specific differences. For example, it has been reported that VACV C6 (CPXV C14) and B14 (CPXV B12) are not covalently ubiquitinated39. Indeed, for the CPXV BR strain we were unable to identify any ubiquitination site in C14 or B12, but all other analyzed CPXV strains contained ubiquitination sites on one or both proteins. Hence, ubiquitination may contribute to species- and strain-specific differences of OPV. As ubiquitination may also depend on the host, it possibly also contributes to OPV adaptation to new hosts.",

However, this did not lead to any results. Also, the sequence logo analysis implemented in Perseus revealed no primary amino acid motif for ubiquitination. Therefore, it may be concluded that ubiquitination site specificity of CPXV mature virion proteins is independent of a distinct amino acid motif near target lysine residues. It is not completely understood what determines ubiquitination site specificity but recently it was suggested that proteins destined for the proteasome contain three factors which are referred to as tripartite degron architecture41. These consist of a primary peptide motif recognized by an E3-ubiquitin ligase (degron), target lysine site(s) for ubiquitination and a disordered degradation initiation site. The degron can be distant from the target ubiquitination site, which could explain why no ubiquitination motif was identified near the lysine residue.",

Recently, 396 unique phosphorylation sites among 83 VACV proteins have been identified43. Strikingly, about 70% of CPXV proteins with conserved ubiquitination sites were identified to contain phosphorylation sites in homologous VACV proteins. This correlation may be important since cross-talk between phosphorylation and ubiquitination has been described, e.g. the regulation of proteasomal degradation by phosphorylation44. Interestingly, the data from Ngo and colleagues43 revealed the greatest number of phosphorylation sites in VACV core proteins p4A and p4B with 17 and 34 unique phosphorylation sites, respectively, indicating that core proteins are packaged in a phosphorylated state in mature virions. Since it is known that phosphorylation motifs, so-called phosphodegrons, can serve as recognition signals for E3 ligases44, it can be hypothesized that OPV proteins may contain phosphorylation motifs representing binding signals for ubiquitin ligases. Although Ngo and colleagues43 did not detect a phosphorylation motif in VACV proteins, they observed protein areas with frequent phosphorylation identifications, so-called phosphorylation clusters, which were also found in major core proteins p4A and p4B.",

            "text": "As multiple ubiquitination sites in CPXV core proteins were elucidated, we next aimed to show their proteasome-dependent degradation in HeLa cells. For this purpose, we performed an LC-MS/MS-based quantitative analysis of ubiquitinated peptides in CPXV-infected HeLa cells in the presence or absence of MG-132 early in infection (2 h post infection). Control and inhibitor-treated samples were prepared in triplicate each, which show clear separation in hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (Fig. 5a,b). Statistical analysis revealed significant abundance differences of ubiquitinated peptides in cells with non-inhibited versus inhibited proteasome, with most viral peptides being stabilized in the presence of proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Table S7). Stabilization of proteins as a result of proteasome inhibition implies that these proteins are degraded by an active proteasome. Controversially, one peptide of the viral RhoA-signaling inhibitor G11 protein was identified to be degraded by the proteasome, while two peptides of G11 were identified as not being degraded. Since it cannot be inferred from the present data which ubiquitination linkage is present at the respective lysine linkage, the ubiquitin linkages in G11 may be not linked by K48 and, hence, may be not associated with proteasomal degradation. However, peptides of all other viral proteins showed clear tendencies for either degradation or not. Functional categorization of CPXV proteins degraded by the proteasome revealed mostly proteins of unknown function, followed by proteins belonging to host\u2013virus interaction, transcription and DNA replication. Although proteins associated with host\u2013virus interaction and transcription were also abundant among CPXV proteins with conserved ubiquitination sites, only few correlations between viral proteins degraded by the proteasome and conserved ubiquitination sites were observed (Supplementary Table S7). Out of 54 viral proteins degraded by the proteasome, 45 are part of the CPXV mature virion proteome17 but only 11 were identified with conserved ubiquitination site.",

Surprisingly, we observed the opposite. Major core proteins A11 and A4 were unchanged or even less ubiquitinated when the proteasome was inhibited, disproving their direct proteasomal degradation. The outer core protein A5 was not identified in this experiment, which is consistent with the fact that no ubiquitination sites in A5 were identified in the ubiquitinome analysis in the CPXV BR strain used in this experiment. Besides structural core proteins, proteins that showed a downregulation upon MG-132 addition were primarily host proteins. Generally, the downregulation of ubiquitination upon proteasome inhibition may be catalyzed by deubiquitinating enzymes. It is not known how ubiquitination of proteins is altered during CPXV infection. However, since no deubiquitinating enzyme in CPXV has been described, host deubiquitinating enzymes may be involved.",

            "text": "Subsequently, we focused on the identification of CPXV proteins other than core proteins that could explain the inhibition of viral replication as a result of proteasome inhibition, and another class of viral proteins attracted our attention. Using siRNA screening, Kilcher and colleagues identified 15 viral candidate genes that impaired intermediate but not early VACV gene expression23. Out of these 15 candidate genes, four reduced the number of pre-replication sites, meaning precursor sites of viral DNA replication, by more than 40%. Strikingly, all of these four proteins were found to be stabilized by proteasome inhibition in our study. These proteins include the serine/threonine-protein kinase B1 (CPXV B1), the putative nuclease G5 (CPXV H5), the ssDNA-binding phosphoprotein I3 (CPXV L3) as well as the primase D5 (CPXV E5). Kilcher and colleagues identified the VACV D5 protein as the genome uncoating factor the depletion of which leads to accumulation of intact cores in the cytoplasm23. D5 has been shown to possess N-terminal primase as well as C-terminal NTPase activity in vitro45\u201348. While both activities are essential for viral DNA replication, only the latter is essential for uncoating23. D5 is expressed early during infection and recruited to VACV cores in cells with inhibited proteasome but not in cells with non-inhibited proteasome, indicating a temporary localization which is reversed by the proteasome23. CPXV E5 and VACV D5 share about 98.5% amino acid identity. In this study we provide evidence that the CPXV D5 homologue is ubiquitinated at two conserved lysine residues and degraded by the proteasome early in infection, supporting the hypothesis of a proteasomally regulated D5-core interaction. It has been proposed that D5 may assist uncoating by actively contributing to global core degradation or by acting at defined core channels23. Our data do not exclude the proteasome-dependent degradation of CPXV core proteins at a later stage of infection but indicate that the proteasomal degradation of other viral proteins, probably the uncoating factor D5 homologue, is a prerequisite. Other viral proteins that were identified to be proteasomally degraded early in infection are discussed in the supplements.",
