            "text": "Pneumonia remains a leading cause of mortality globally: 4.2 million pneumonia deaths were recorded in 2004 [1]. The highest incidence of disease occurs in young children [2,3]. An estimated 156 million pneumonia episodes occur annually in children less than five years old. Over 95% of these occur in the developing world, where the incidence of clinical pneumonia is estimated to be 0.29 episodes per child-year. Almost three-quarters of childhood pneumonia deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia [4]. Bacterial pathogens, most notably Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type B, are important vaccine-preventable causes of pneumonia [5]. Viruses, in particular influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), are also responsible for a large number of pneumonia cases each year [6]. Using global population data for 2005, for children under the age of five years, it was estimated that RSV was responsible for over 30 million episodes of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), with ~3 million of these requiring hospital admission, and 66,000-199,000 deaths [7]. By similar analyses of data from 2008, influenza viruses were estimated to cause 20 million LRTI and 1 million severe LRTI, with 28,000-111,500 deaths, in children aged less than five years [8]. In both of these reviews, 99% of deaths from either influenza\u2013or RSV\u2013associated LRTI occurred in the developing world. These viruses may be responsible for up to 35% of LRTI (RSV 22% [7] and influenza 13% [8]) in children under the age of five years. Other viral pathogens associated with childhood pneumonia include adenoviruses, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and parainfluenza viruses [5,9].",

These definitions were designed to have optimal sensitivity for the diagnosis of potentially life-threatening bacterial infection in resource-poor settings [15]. It was accepted that some over-diagnosis and unnecessary treatment would occur [37]. As was demonstrated in a South African study, where virus-associated pneumonias were reduced by a third in children given a nine-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, a proportion of virus-positive individuals would have had a secondary bacterial infection [38], but many will have received an unnecessary course of antibiotics. Recent work from Pakistan has confirmed that placebo and amoxicillin had equivalent efficacy for WHO non-severe pneumonia and that oral amoxicillin at home is an acceptable alternative to hospital admission and parenteral antibiotics for severe pneumonia [39,40]. In Maela, almost all patients were treated with at least one antimicrobial drug, yet over a third (excluding adenovirus) had a proven viral infection. Collectively, these findings point to the likely over treatment of viral infections in children with WHO defined pneumonia, which may contribute to the rising prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in the developing world [41].",

            "text": "The enhanced surveillance system had several limitations. Not all hospitalised pneumonia episodes were captured and therefore it was not possible to calculate virus-specific incidence rates. Estimating the representativeness of the patients enrolled by comparison of enhanced surveillance results with routine surveillance figures is problematic. However, as we note, if a direct comparison is made, enhanced surveillance included 47.8% (640/1,340) of all LRTI episodes identified through routine surveillance in children under five years of age but only 9.2% (68/741) of episodes in patients aged five years or older. Differences in case definitions used in the routine surveillance compared with enhanced surveillance is the most likely explanation for this discrepancy [21]. For the under-5 age group the definitions were almost identical (i.e. WHO-based) but for the older age group LRTI was defined in routine surveillance by the presence of a fever plus cough or sore throat and shortness of breath/difficulty breathing. Absence of a requirement for abnormal chest signs likely resulted in inclusion of many non-pneumonia cases within the LRTI category. The low number of deaths recorded in the HIS system suggests that severity was not a significant reason for non-inclusion. Also, since PU-AMI hospital was the only general medical admissions unit within the camp, there were not significant numbers of patients missed as a result of admission to other hospitals. However, it remains possible that the older participants were not representative of the entire hospitalised pneumonia patient group. Additional severity data (e.g. need for supplemental oxygen and length of stay) and outcome data were not collected, which further limit the conclusions that can be drawn from the surveillance and the comparisons that can be made with other studies. The panel of viruses tested for included the key pathogens for which evidence of an association with pneumonia is proven, but inclusion of PCR assays to detect additional respiratory viruses would have added value and may have identified a higher prevalence of multiple infections. Studies using multiplexed virus PCR assays have detected both an increased proportion of children with single and multiple viral lower respiratory infections [42]. Both human bocavirus and rhinoviruses may be detected in a large proportion of pneumonia cases, although data regarding causality from case\u2013control studies are still limited [36,43]. Despite this, it was demonstrated that influenza virus and/or RSV were associated with a third of hospitalised pneumonia episodes in Maela.",
