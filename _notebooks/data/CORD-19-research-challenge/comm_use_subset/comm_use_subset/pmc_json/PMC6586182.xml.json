Although some uncontrolled studies suggested that NIV was effective and safe in management of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),13, 14, 15 others have highlighted concern of increased transmission risk to healthcare workers when patients with SARS are treated with NIV.16 Use of NIV in AHRF caused by pandemic H1N12009 virus (pdmH1N1) infection has been reported from several countries,17, 18, 19 with reported NIV failure reaching up to 85%.17 All studies were limited by their retrospective nature and, often, small sample size.",

However, it is important to note that the process responsible for higher requirement for inhaled nitric oxide in patients treated with NIV could be related to timing of transition from NIV to invasive mechanical ventilation (ie, if transition were delayed) rather than the use of NIV per se. Finally, the confidence interval around the point estimate for the association of initial NIV and 90\u2010day mortality is wide; therefore, a real difference cannot be entirely be excluded in either direction. However, given the very high failure rate, our data therefore indicate that use of NIV in patients with MERS should generally be avoided unless it was used for patients with the least severity of illness.",

This is the largest cohort examining ventilation practices among critically ill patients with MERS that contains detailed demographic, baseline characteristics, physiology, interventions, and outcomes. Our study is also subject to several limitations. Due to the retrospective nature of the study, we do not have detailed settings of NIV (eg, PEEP and driving pressure), data on patient tolerance, the type of NIV mask interface (nasal or full\u2010face mask), pre\u2010ICU use of NIV, and reasons for intubation. We do not have data to address the association of NIV vs invasive ventilation with subsequent nosocomial pneumonia. Our study was not designed to address infection control issues related to NIV and risk of transmission to healthcare workers, and therefore, we cannot report on this outcome that is important to healthcare workers and other patients. Although we adjusted for imbalances in baseline characteristics using propensity score, the effect of residual unmeasured confounding cannot be excluded. Given the retrospective nature of our study, the potential effect of indication bias exists. For example, our data show that less severely ill patients as reflected by SOFA were more likely to have been managed by NIV. Nevertheless, we accounted for SOFA in the propensity score, and if residual bias exists, it would likely favor (show better outcomes with) NIV, making our findings a conservative estimate of any potential risks associated with NIV. In addition, the potential for lead\u2010time bias exists. Patients receiving NIV may have presented with less advanced disease, and the disease may have merely progressed while on NIV to the same point at which patients with more advanced had already presented and required invasive ventilation from outset. Due to limited number of patients who avoided intubation, we were not powered to identify independent predictors for NIV success.",
