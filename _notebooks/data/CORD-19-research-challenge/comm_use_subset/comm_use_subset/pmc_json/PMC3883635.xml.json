However, a non-tagged p7 showed cytoplasmic orientation for its C-terminus, compatible with a form with only one TM domain [21], [22]. More recently, two very different CD spectra (SRCD), one consistent with an \u03b1-helical form, and another that was not assigned to any particular structure, both showing some channel activity, were obtained when p7 protein was reconstituted in membranes with varying PC\u2236PE ratios [23].

We have used attenuated total reflection Fourier Transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, a technique that is especially suitable for studies in lipid bilayers. We have used three methods of reconstitution in lipidic membranes. The first two methods co-reconstitute p7, after the protein is dried from a solvent, with lipids, either with the aid of detergent \u2013 \u2018dialysis\u2019 method \u2013 or without detergent \u2013 \u2018direct\u2019 method \u2013. These two procedures may be followed by a freeze-thawing and extrusion protocol. In the third method, \u2013 \u2018addition\u2019 method \u2013 p7 is added directly from solvent to preformed liposomes, as in the CF-release assay [7], [24]. All of these methods have been used previously in the literature. The ability of p7 to elicit CF release and proton transport has been tested in the controled conditions where the p7 conformation was known, which allowed to infer that the \u2018\u03b1-helical hairpin\u2019 form is responsible for proton transport, but not of CF release.",

In contrast, when recombinant p7 was solubilized first in methanol, a band centered at 1627 cm\u22121 appeared prominently, indicating an approximate 60/40% mixture of \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-strands, respectively (trace M in Fig. 3A, henceforth referred to as form B). Similar differences were observed using a synthetic form of p7 (not shown). Thus, regardless of the sample origin, a dramatic increase in \u03b2-structure is observed when the protein was pre-solubilized and dried from a methanol solution. For the \u03b1-helical form A, analysis of the amide I region showed that \u03b2-structure constitutes approximately 10\u201315% of the total, whereas the \u03b1-helix content was 73%, i.e., \u223c48 amino acids. This \u03b1-helical content is consistent with the reported 62% obtained for recombinant p7 in DHPC micelles [14], the 70% obtained for synthetic p7 dissolved in 50% TFE [12], and a recent NMR structure of a p7 variant in DPC micelles [20], which is also mostly \u03b1-helical and roughly consistent with an \u03b1-helical hairpin model with two \u03b1-helical TM domains. In contrast, form B obtained after methanol solubilization showed \u03b2-structure and \u03b1-helical content of 40% and 55%, respectively. This corresponds to \u223c37 residues forming \u03b1-helices, too short to account for the two predicted \u03b1-helical TM domains, but too long for a single TM domain. Therefore, this sample is likely to contain incompletely, or incorrectly, reconstituted p7 protein.",

In the first case, p7 was almost completely \u03b1-helical, whereas in the second case, p7 contained more than 50% of \u03b2-structure. However, the CD spectra of p7 in HFIP or methanol solution show no differences, with a high (\u223c70%) percentage of helical structure (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that it is the drying procedure than induces \u03b2-structure formation, and not the solvent per se. This \u03b2-structure is retained even after reconstitution in lipids, unless the sample is extruded repeatedly afterwards. This also explains that when added to preformed liposomes, p7 adopts \u03b2-structure regardless of the solvent used (Fig. 3C); while p7 is predominantly \u03b1-helical in any of these solvents, poor incorporation of p7 in the bilayers after being briefly exposed to the aqueous environment results in \u03b2-structure formation.",

Thus, to compare the conformation of the fraction of p7 incorporated to liposome membranes using the dyalisis method - after extrusion -, and that using the addition method, we initially attempted to use a FLAG-p7 and detection by Western-Blot. However, the flagged construct did not elicit CF release using the addition method, even though it was purified in the same way as the non-tagged p7 and that it was pure (not shown). Therefore, further work to test the presence of p7 in the liposomes was performed with the non-tagged p7 protein, and the presence of p7 was directly monitored using SDS-PAGE of the pure protein.",

This suggests that the PEL fraction is not merely protein precipitate, but it must also contain lipid. To test this, we analyzed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) the contents of the flotation tube, from top to bottom, in 400 \u00b5L fractions. The results showed that liposomes were also present at the bottom of the tube in both samples (Fig. S6 in File S1). The latter suggests that a fraction of the liposomes contains an excessive proportion of p7 protein incorporated, and sinks to the bottom of the tube. The estimated density of the lipid fraction in PAESC liposomes is 1.03 g/mL [35]\u2013[37], whereas the density of the three phases used in the sucrose gradient, 0, 10 and 20%, are 1.01548, 1.05534 and 1.09827 g/mL, respectively. Therefore, pure liposomes should accumulate at the interface between 0 and 10% of sucrose. At the lipid-to-protein ratio molar used in the experiment (100\u22361), and assuming uniform incorporation, the density of the liposomes should be 1.0499 g/mL, therefore these liposomes should still accumulate at the 0\u201310% interface. However, if the incorporation is not homogeneous, e.g., if the lipid to protein ratio is between 70\u22361 and 20\u22361, the liposomes would be found in the 10% section. The results observed (Fig. S6B in File S1) indicate that some liposomes contain more p7 than that corresponding to a ratio 1\u223620, as they are found at the bottom of the 20% sucrose section.",

For comparison, we used a similar hydrophobic protein with a single transmembrane (TM) domain, the peptide M2 (18-60) from influenza A, which caused only a minor CF release (Fig. S7 in File S1), suggesting that CF release may be specific for the C-terminal region of p7. In summary, these results show that correct incorporation and native conformation of full length p7 is not necessary to elicit CF release, and that insertion of the TM2 fraction of p7 into lipid bilayers may be sufficient, based on the more hydrophobic nature of TM2. We note that in a recently published structural model of p7 [20], TM1 and TM2 would correspond to three helical segments H1\u2013H3, i.e., H1 and first half of H2 (TM1), and second half of H2 and H3 (TM2).

However, after removing non incorporated CF, no significant differences in fluorescence were observed between the CF-loaded control (without p7) and sample (with p7) liposomes (Fig. 5C, white bars). Differences were not observed even 1 h after removing non-incorporated CF. Most or all CF was still encapsulated, as shown by the large increase in fluorescence after Triton X-100 addition in both preparations (Fig. 5C, grey bars), and kinetics of CF release were also similar to the addition of only methanol to the liposomes (Fig. 5D).

Regions in and around the loop contain abundant \u03b2-branched side chains (V, I), and bulky residues (Y, F,W), which disfavor \u03b1-helical conformation [39]\u2013[41].

This is supported by the observed direct interaction between the inhibitor amantadine and TM2 leucines 51\u201357, which have been shown unequivocally to be part of a membrane inserted \u03b1-helix [20], [47], and Leu to Ala mutations at this region of TM2 produced an amantadine resistant p7 mutant [32]. However, amantadine and rimantadine have also been reported to interact with some residues in TM1 when forming an \u03b1-helical hairpin [20], [32], [47]. Thus we propose that these drugs interact with membrane-inserted TM2, possibly increasing its rigidity (and preventing CF release) when form B is present, and interact with both TM1 and TM2 (inhibiting proton channel activity) when form A is present. Indeed, that amantadine is able to interact with both TM1 and TM2 has been recently confirmed experimentally using p7 in DPC micelles, although the strain used is quite different from ours [20]. The p7 sequence (subtype 5a, strain EUH1480) in that report is less than 50% identical to the sequence used here (1a, H77). Overall, our results suggest that, although a CF release assay may be able to detect p7 channel inhibitors because of the proposed dependency of CF release on membrane-inserted TM2, a proton or ion transport assay is more relevant to discover channel blockers.",

However, although a recent NMR based model places TM1 as lining the lumen [20], this is still a controversial point. Support for this arrangement is found in the physico-chemical properties of TM1 and molecular dynamics simulations [16], [19], and the observed partial inhibition of p7 channel activity by Cu2+, but not by Mg2+\n[17]. Peptides corresponding to TM2 or TM1, e.g., p7(35-63) or p7(1-34) easily aggregate, so that individual channel activity of TM1 or TM2 cannot be properly measured [12]. In the latter paper, peptide TM1 p7(1-34) showed some channel activity that was probably non-specific, because inhibition data was not reported, and the peptide had not been purified [12]. Other reports were unable to measure channel activity for this peptide [5], and we show that purified peptide p7(1-26) is not even \u03b1-helical in presence of lipid bilayers after methanol exposure, and it is only partially helical after HFIP exposure.",

This is not rare in viral proteins; the N terminus of HCV NS4B has been reported to assume dual TM topology, with possible distinct functions, on each side of the ER membrane [48]. In addition, the hepatitis B virus surface L-glycoprotein also adopts different TM topologies, acting during virus assembly as a matrix-like protein, and in virus entry as a receptor-binding protein [49].
