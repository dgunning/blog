ARV is a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus, and the genome consists of 10 segments packaged into a non-enveloped icosahedral double-capsid shell, with a diameter of 70\u201380 nm [1, 2]. The genome of ARV is comprised of three large (L1, L2, and L3), three medium (M1, M2, and M3), and four small (S1, S2, S3, and S4) segments, which encode proteins of the \u03bb, \u03bc, and \u03c3 classes, respectively [3\u20136]. The first seven bases (5\u2032-GCUUUUU-3\u2032) of the 5\u2032 non-coding regions (NCRs) and the last five bases (5\u2032-UCAUC-3\u2032) of the 3\u2032 NCR of each ARV genome segment are highly conserved across all ARV strains [7].",

The signs of ARV infection in waterfowl include general weakness, diarrhea, serofibrinous pericarditis, and a swollen liver and spleen with small white necrotic foci [10, 16, 17]. Waterfowl-origin reovirus (WRV) was first identified as a pathogen in South Africa in 1950 [18]. It was subsequently isolated from Muscovy ducks in France in 1972 and was designated as classical Muscovy duck reovirus (MDRV) [10]. Classical MDRV first emerged in China in 1997. It mainly infects Muscovy ducklings at 10 days of age, and the infection persists until the ducklings are 6 weeks old. The mortality rate ranges from 10 to 30% [19]. However, many researchers have reported that classical MDRV isolates are non-pathogenic in shelduck ducklings, Pekin ducklings, and other duckling varieties [19, 20].",

Unlike classical MDRV infection, this disease is mainly characterized by severe hemorrhagic, necrotic lesions in the liver and spleen, with a mortality rate ranging from 5 to 50%. The virus can infect a variety of duck species, such as Pekin, Muscovy, and domesticated wild duck. Goslings have also been infected in some parts of China [21\u201323]. Because of the different clinical signs and cytopathic effects compared to chicken-origin ARVs and classical MDRVs, the causative agent of this disease was named as novel Muscovy duck reovirus (N-MDRV). Phylogenetic analyses based on the amino acid sequences encoded by the S2 and S3 segments also demonstrated that N-MDRVs are significantly different from chicken-origin ARVs and classical MDRVs [24].",

The genomes of the two viruses were organized similarly to the genomes of the WRVs among Avian orthoreovirus species (Table 1). The complete genomes of MDRV-SH12 and MDRV-DH13 were 23,418 bp in length, and divided into the following 10 segments: L1 (3959 bp), L2 (3830 bp), L3 (3907 bp), M1 (2283 bp), M2 (2158 bp), M3 (1996 bp), S1 (1568 bp), S2 (1324 bp), S3 (1202 bp), and S4 (1191 bp). All 10 segments exhibited approximately 50% G + C content. To determine the coding regions of these two viruses, each segment sequence was used as a query in a BLASTp search of the non-redundant protein database. The proteins encoded by these two viruses included at least eight structural proteins (\u03bbA, \u03bbB, \u03bbC, \u03bcA, \u03bcB, \u03c3A, \u03c3B, and \u03c3C) and four nonstructural proteins (\u03bcNS, p10, p18, and \u03c3NS). These proteins were 97\u20131293 aa in length. ORF prediction and homology searches showed that 9 of the 10 genome segments encoded a single ORF.
