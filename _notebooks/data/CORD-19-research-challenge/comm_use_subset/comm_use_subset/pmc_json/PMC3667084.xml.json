            "text": "\nC. jejuni is a Gram-negative, microaerophilic bacterium possessing a helical-shaped morphology [1]. In industrialized countries, C. jejuni has been one of the primary causal agents of gastroenteritis. In 2012, in Germany alone 62626 cases have been reported [2]. Campylobacteriosis predominantly induces mild, self-limiting diarrhoea, however severe cases have been reported [3]. Several studies have shown the potential contribution of Campylobacteriosis in the development of neuropathies such as the Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome [4], [5]. The prominent route of infection is the improper handling and insufficient cooking of poultry [6]. The broad distribution of this pathogen in combination with a high clinical relevance necessitates fast and reliable diagnosis. Although several genomic typing methods exist [7], [8], these are often time-consuming and inappropriate for a point-of-care application. Instead, a direct approach detecting the whole bacterium is beneficial. This can be achieved by using specific antibodies to membrane-associated antigens similar to the Latex-Agglutination-Test that is already available for several bacterial pathogens including Campylobacter\n[9].",

The HaloTag\u00ae provides several advantages to other commonly used tags as it enhances the amount of soluble proteins expressed [14] reducing the formation of inclusion bodies. In addition, the interaction of tag and its specific ligand is based on covalent binding [15]. This negates the need for additional purification steps as the crude lysate can simply be spotted onto coated microarrays. Only the target proteins presented as fusion constructs bearing a HaloTag\u00ae will bind to the surface, whereas the remaining proteins are washed off.",

Bacteria only posses a poly(A)-tail on their mRNA in rare cases [18], [19]. Although methods exist to isolate mRNA from bacteria [20], [21], it is generally considered to be more challenging as compared to eukaryotic RNA, where Oligo(dT) primers are sufficient [22]. Therefore, we refrained from isolating the mRNA prior to reverse transcription. Instead, the generated cDNA was normalized, i.e. trimmed down, afterwards by the use of a duplex-specific nuclease [23]. This approach has been shown to effectively reduce the amount of rRNA-derived molecules, thereby altering the overall composition in favour of the mRNA-derived cDNA without including a bias [24]. Further optimization of library construction was achieved by using a ligation-independent cloning as well as electroporation, which have been shown to enhance overall cloning efficiency [25], [26].",

After comparing the median value and the standard deviation of each sample to the values of the positive references, a selection of 192 clones were picked to be sequenced. Generally, we grouped clones into three categories after screening. Group I included samples showing a higher median contrast value than all the positive references used, group II encompassed the samples with median contrast values in between those of different positive references and group III the remaining samples which albeit below the lowest positive reference were still above all the negative reference signals. After screening 1536 clones, 32% fell into group I, 15% encompassed group II and 4% made up group III while the remaining 50% were below the negative controls. The sequenced clones were \u201cblasted\u201d against the genome of C. jejuni NCTC 11168 (RefSeq: NC_002163) to identify the corresponding genes and proteins. For further experiments, known antigens of C. jejuni found within the sequenced clones were discarded and we focused solely on 22 novel potentially immunogenic proteins. Several of the identified clones carried only truncated fragments of the corresponding genes. In addition, some of the sequenced inserts possessed a frame shift.

Summing up these results, Table 1 shows the respective mean Q values and errors (n = 25) for each of the proteins identified. The highest scores were attained by cj0926 and cj0927 with 1.77\u00b10.75 and 2.23\u00b10.58 respectively, indicating a potentially stronger immunogenicity as compared to the known immunodominant proteins HisJ and CjaA. However, we restrained from further characterizing the former two proteins via epitope mapping as both are highly conserved and show multiple homologies in cellular organisms (cj0927) or epsilonproteobacteria (cj0926) according to the NCBI protein cluster database [30]. The same rationale was applied for cj1576, which is conserved in cellular organisms and peaks at 1.55\u00b10.43. Instead, we focused on cj0623, cj1575 and cj0669, which are highly conserved in Campylobacter only as well as cj0920c and cj1380, which in turn are conserved in Campylobacteraceae. Cj1380, cj0623 and cj1575c represent proteins with high mean Q values of 1.57\u00b10.39, 1.33\u00b10.47 and 1.21\u00b10.46 respectively.

Finally, two proteins showing relatively low mean Q values of 0.40\u00b10.13 and 0.34\u00b10.14 for cj0476 and cj1723 were picked to complete the selection of proteins for epitope mapping.",

Although, the structural information is merely based on modelling, the z-values of this model fall within close proximity to zero (\u20130.88) commonly associated with x-ray crystallographic results [37].

These findings are supported by further calculations performed using the EMBOSS garnier and EMBOSS antigenic algorithms. These results underline the antigenic potential of the consensus sequence TLIKELKRLGI as well as predicting almost identical secondary structures as the automated SWISS MODEL.

The region encompassing amino acids 27 \u2013 38 SPFAVWKFLDAL seems to be the most promising as its rfi values are high in microarray experiments. Furthermore, the prediction tools determined this sequence to be antigenic and located extracellularly, thus easily accessible. This is not true for the other two regions detected from cj0920c, which are either lacking antigenic potential or are located within the cell or in transmembrane regions. Still, the results indicate non-specific binding to contribute mainly to the positive signal. This exempts SPFAVWKFLDAL from a suitable diagnostic application; however, further analysis might be helpful to investigate the full potential of this sequence as a specific epitope.",

For C. jejuni the generation of monoclonal antibodies against cj0669 is mandatory to further investigate the affinity and kinetics of the observed binding event by BIAcore. This might grant further insight whether or not this sequence is a suitable candidate for specific detection in a biosensor or if cj0669 is a suitable vaccine candidate. Mutagenesis of cj0669 might help to illuminate the function of this protein and its potential role if any in pathogenicity. Once this is determined, a monoclonal antibody might be used to cocrystallize the antigen for X-ray crystallography to assign a measured structure to the predicted model.

For optimization, the control tube was subjected to 7, 9, 11, and 13 cycles with 12 \u00b5l aliquots taken every two cycles. The optimization samples were analyzed by gel electrophoresis (1% agarose, TAE, 100 V) and the optimal cycle number determined. The remaining three tubes were subjected to 9 + X cycles with X being the differential of the optimized cycles to the originally performed seven cycles. After the second PCR, the experimental reactions were compared to the optimal control reaction using gel electrophoresis as above. Reactions showing a successful normalization were combined and used in a third PCR reaction. After the final PCR, the reactions were purified by QIAquick PCR Purification Kit.",

Peptides 44 and 45 of cj0669 show mean rfi values of approximately eight and six thousand A.U. respectively after incubation with polyclonal anti-Campylobacter antibodies. However, using E.coli antibodies the signals are almost gone amounting to less than 500 A.U. in rfi.

The median is represented by a horizontal line within each box and the small rectangle corresponds to the mean of each sample. The original sequence TLIKELKRLGI shows a mean fluorescence intensity of about 10000 A.U. For most amino acids within this sequence, replacement by alanine has no to little effect. However, if glycine is replaced by alanine the peptide loses most of its binding activity, clearly seen by a drop of mean rfi to less than 1000 A.U.

Next, screening is performed using polyclonal antibodies and potentially immunogenic proteins are selected. The corresponding clones are sequenced and the genes and proteins identified, either by exact match (sequenced strain) or homology (clinical isolate). A set of candidate proteins is selected focusing only on previously unknown antigens, while known antigens are discarded. Immunodominant nature of each full-length protein is assessed by ELISA and microarray analyses to further narrow down the number of proteins to be tested via epitope mapping, if desired. Linear epitope mapping reveals potential antigenic sites, which are tested for specificity and in alanine scan. Finally, bioinformatic tools are used to model the 3-dimensional structure, accessibility and antigenicity of each protein. Afterwards, the most promising candidates can be used in future applications including but not limited to monoclonal antibody generation, kinetic measurements, structural and functional analyses and diagnostic applications.",
