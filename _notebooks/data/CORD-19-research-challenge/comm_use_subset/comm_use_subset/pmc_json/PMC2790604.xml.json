            "text": "As a member of the Flavivirus genus in the Flaviridae family, DV is a small, positive strand RNA enveloped virus. There are four serotypes of dengue virus (DV1-4). Their genome encodes a polyprotein precursor of at least seven non-structural proteins and three structural proteins which are the capsid protein (C), the membrane protein (M) and the envelope glycoprotein (E) [1]. The polyprotein is processed co- and post-translationally by cellular signalase in the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and by a viral protease in the cytosol [1], [2], [3]. The nascent C protein contains a C-terminal hydrophobic domain that acts as a signal sequence for translocation of the immature form of M, the prM, into the lumen of the rough ER. Two adjacent prM C-terminal transmembrane domains are responsible for prM membrane anchoring and E translocation into the ER [2]. prM and E associate into heterodimers at ER membranes [4], [5] where they assemble with the viral RNA/C complex to form progeny virions [1]. During the egress of virions through the secretory pathway, prM protein is cleaved by the trans-Golgi resident furin protease to form the M envelope protein and the soluble pr segment, which is released into the extracellular medium upon particle secretion [6]. prM cleavage marks maturation of flavivirus virions [7], [8]. Cleavage of prM is intimately correlated to change of conformation of envelope protein complexes. Although it was thought that prM cleavage is a prerequisite for E dimerization, recent studies show that change of conformation most probably occurs at low pH in the TGN and allows cleavage of prM by furin [6], [9], [10].",

Subviral particles and infectious virions are co-produced in infected cells, assemble in an immature form, and subsequently undergo the same maturation process and display similar fusion activity as infectious viruses [17], [18]. Therefore, subviral particles could be a precious tool for research on cell biology of DVs. Although there have been attempts by several groups to obtain DV RSPs, either their production was inefficient or the sequence of DVs structural proteins had to be substantially modified [19] before they could efficiently generate RSPs. For example, the furin cleavage site on prM had to be mutated to establish the DV2 RSPs producing CHO cell line because it was found that the DV2 RSPs cause cell-cell fusion [20], [21]. Others replaced a portion of the carboxy-terminal region of DV1 and DV2 E genes with the corresponding sequence of JEV to observe significant RSP secretion [22], [23]. In either case, these modifications may interfere with the interactions with cytosolic proteins and, possibly, with the maturation and folding of the structural proteins.",

            "text": "Here we describe the efficient production of native RSPs of the four DV serotypes by using a codon optimization strategy. Codons of the DV prME gene were replaced with those preferentially used in mammalian cells. Optimization was first applied to the DV1 prME gene. We found that this experimental approach could efficiently increase the intracellular expression level of the E glycoprotein in human cells and therefore enhance the production of DV1 RSPs. We have established a DV1 RSPs producing stable cell line (HeLa-prME). Our data by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy show that most of E protein co-localizes with markers of the ER, where RSPs accumulate. Biochemical analysis of secreted RSPs demonstrates that they contain E homodimers and M, indicating that RSPs have trafficked through the secretory pathway and that maturation process has occurred. Using the HeLa-prME cell line, we have developed a semi-quantitative assay to screen a 122 genes cellular membrane trafficking siRNA library and identified genes that may be involved in the secretion of DV. From our screen, 23 genes show a significant reduction in DV1 RSPs secretion whereas for 22 genes RSPs levels were increased in cell supernatants. These data provide a proof of concept that RSPs of DVs and the producing cell line are safe tools that can be used in the study of viral egress. Finally, the optimization strategy was applied to DV2, DV3 and DV4 prME, and RSPs for all four DV serotypes were efficiently produced. These native RSPs are, therefore, a safe mimicry of virions that can be used to study viral and cellular requirements for virus assembly and egress.",

E protein was detected in transfected cells at low expression level (Figure 1A). Analysis of the prME gene sequence revealed that 15% of nucleotide triplets were rarely used in mammalian cells so that its codon usage was not adapted for efficient expression in this cell system. Thus we designed and synthesized an optimized DV1 prME (prMEopt) gene in which the rarely used codons were replaced with those preferred by mammalian cells, without changing the amino acid sequence (Figure S1). More than 70% codons were modified for prME optimization. In addition, we also removed the negative cis-acting sites (such as splice sites, poly(A) signals, etc) which might have negatively influenced expression. The optimized gene resulted in high and stable expression levels in transfected mammalian cells (Figure 1B). Both the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) and percentage of positive cells increased by almost 3 fold. E protein was hardly detected without cell permeabilization, indicating that its localization was intracellular and was not expressed at cell surface (data not shown).",

As expected, the DV1 E glycoprotein mainly distributed in the ER in HeLa-prME cells, as shown by immunofluorescence, where it colocalized with Erp72 (Figure 2A\u2013D), whereas it showed no colocalization with ERGIC-53 (Figure 2E\u2013H) and Golgin 97 (Figure 2I\u2013L).

In order to verify whether this ER staining reflects the presence of E-containing assembled particles, we analyzed the HeLa-prME stable cell line by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on thin sections of fixed, epon-embedded cells (Figure 3A). We found that HeLa-prME, but not control HeLa cells (data not shown), displayed dilated ER membranes with aligned round particles and elongated parallel tubules. Particles were \u223c20 nm in diameter and homogenous in size and shape. The aligned particles that we have observed in HeLa-prME cells are similar to the stacked viral particles which have been described in cisternae of the rough ER in infected insect and mammalian cells [25], [26], [27], [28]. To confirm that these structures contain viral proteins, we labeled thawed cryosections with the 4G2 antibody that recognizes the E protein (Figure 3B\u2013D). We found antibody binding for the E protein present in the lumen of cisternae, where it is localized to electron lucent, round particles and tubular structures. In addition, E protein is also found on amorphous, electron dense material present in these cisternae (Figure 3B). To confirm the nature of these cisternae by other than morphological criteria we performed a double labeling of the 4G2 antibody with the ER resident protein calreticulin. We found antibody binding for calreticulin present on the 4G2 positive cisternae (Figure 3C), unequivocally identifying them as ER. In addition, we found a lower but significant amount of label for the E protein present in the Golgi stack and in vesicles in the Golgi area (Figure 3D).",

Cell lysate (CL) and clarified supernatant (SN) concentrated by ultra-centrifugation were analyzed by Western blotting followed by incubation with either the anti-E monoclonal antibody 4E11 (Figure 4A\u2013B) or an anti-DV1 serum from a human patient (Figure 4C\u2013D). In CL samples, a 50 kDa monomeric form of the E glycoprotein was predominantly observed (Figure 4A,C), whereas high levels of 100 kDa E glycoprotein homodimers were readily detected in SN samples (Figure 4A\u2013D). This suggests that whereas in HeLa-prME cells the majority of viral proteins are localized in the early pre-Golgi secretory pathway in an immature state, secreted RSPs have passed through maturation stages in the Golgi apparatus thus resulting in homodimerization of E proteins. To further confirm the presence of E dimers in SN and exclude the possibility that dimerization resulted from treatment for electrophoresis, the SN were incubated in the presence or absence of a cross linker (3, 3\u2032-dithiobis [sulfosuccinimidylpropionate]; DTSSP) and then subjected to Western blotting using the anti-E 4E11 antibody. Under these conditions, we observed that E dimer/monomer ratio was lower in non-treated RSPs compared to the DTSSP treated (data not shown). These data indicate that, in SN, a significant proportion of E protein is present as a homodimer and detection of E monomers most likely results from partial dissociation under the denaturing conditions of electrophoresis. E homodimers were no longer detected when samples were heated in presence of dithiothreitol (Figure 4B). In addition, the prM protein could be readily detected with the anti-DV1 serum in CL but not SN samples (Figure 4C). By contrast, when the HeLa-prME cells were treated with NH4Cl, which inhibits acidification of the trans-Golgi compartment and, hence, the activity of furin protease and prM cleavage, prM was also found in SN (Figure 4D\u2013E). To our surprise E dimers were also detected in these conditions. Interestingly, the E monomers from SN exhibited slower electrophoretic mobility than those of CL samples, which suggests that E glycoproteins have acquired complex N-glycans in the Golgi apparatus. This was confirmed by N-Glycosidase F (PNGase F) and endoglycosidase H (EndoH) digestion (Figure 4 F\u2013G), which cleaves nearly all types of N-glycan chains or only high mannose and some hybrid N-glycan chains from glycoproteins, respectively. Whereas E protein in CL was sensitive to both treatments, only PNGase F digestion increased the electrophoretic mobility of E protein in SN, demonstrating that RSPs had acquired EndoH-resistant, complex N-glycans in the Golgi apparatus before secretion. Moreover, we found that secretion of DV RSPs was altered by incubation of cells at 15\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C, which block cargo transport from ERGIC to cis-Golgi and exit from the trans-Golgi, respectively, and by brefeldin A treatment, which inhibits exit from ER and induces fusion of Golgi membranes with ER (data not shown). Altogether, homodimerization of E, acquisition of complex sugars and efficient cleavage of prM indicate that prM and E viral proteins have correctly assembled in the ER into RSPs which have trafficked through the secretory pathway before secretion into the cell medium.",

Detection of prM or M in this assay results from co-immunoprecipitation and, therefore, indicates efficient interaction with E protein. Secretion of E and M proteins was detected from the 8 hours time point on, with a significant increase at 24 hours post-chase (Figure 5A). Consistently, high levels of E and M proteins were found in cell lysates at all time points with a substantial diminution at 8 and 24 hours post-chase (Figure 5B). Two major protein products were found in cell lysates, with an apparent molecular weight corresponding to E and prM proteins. Bands of higher molecular weight were also present and could be oligomeric forms of E and prM or M. Interestingly, the pattern of immunoprecipitated proteins from cell supernatant was slightly different. Higher proportions of E dimers were found and a band corresponding to the molecular weight of M but not prM was detected at the 24 hours time point, indicating that most secreted RSPs are mature.

As expected, Triton-X100-solubilized E protein and RSP-associated E protein appeared in distinct fractions of a discontinuous 20 to 60% sucrose gradient (Figure 6). The amount of E glycoprotein in each fraction was quantified. E glycoprotein in non-treated sample sedimented in fractions containing 20% to 30% sucrose (Figure 6, black bars) whereas in Triton-X100 treated samples, E protein was solubilized and detected in fractions at the top of the gradient (Figure 6, white bars). These data further confirm that the RSPs formed in HeLa-prME are secreted into culture medium from which they can be easily purified by ultracentrifugation. Moreover, we have obtained preliminary evidence that DV1 RSPs and DV1 viral particles isolated from HeLa-prME and mammalian infected cells, respectively, sediment at similar densities on 10\u201360% continuous gradient of sucrose (Dr Philippe Despres, Institut Pasteur, personal communication).",

To identify host factors that could either enhance or reduce production of DV RSPs, we first developed a quantitative assay to relatively quantify levels of secreted particles in supernatant of HeLa-prME cells. The chemiluminescence dot-blot (CLDB) assay is based on the concentration of RSPs from cell supernatant on PVDF membranes, followed by detection of E with a specific horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody and quantification of substrate-induced luminescence using a luminometer. Our data using purified E protein of known concentrations showed that, when ranging between 400 pg to 40 ng, E protein on PVDF membrane displayed a very good linear correlation with the luminescence density in CLDB assay (Figure 7A). The CLDB was first used to estimate the RSPs yield from HeLa-prME cell line, and we found that the concentration of E protein in supernatant of HeLa-prME cell line was around 500\u20131000 ng/ml under the culture condition used for siRNA transfection (data not shown). We then screened a siRNA library that consisted of 122 genes which target cellular membrane trafficking using the HeLa-prME cell line. Non-targeting siRNA (NT) and siRNA targeting DV1 prME were added as controls. Library and control siRNAs were transfected in triplicates on 96-well plates. Levels of RSPs secreted by siRNA transfected HeLa-prME were measured by CLDB assay from 40 microliters of supernatant from each well. Levels of E protein in cell supernatant were expressed in relative luminescence units and ratios to that of NT controls were shown in Figure 7B. T test was used to assess the statistical significance of differences between each sample and NT. Differences were considered statistically significant when P<0.05. We observed that targeting of 23 genes resulted in significant reduction of DV1 RSPs amounts in supernatants whereas targeting of 22 other genes induced a significant increase. For instance, our results showed that down-regulation of ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1), which regulates secretory membrane transport [30], resulted in 3 fold decrease of DV1 RSPs in cell supernatant, suggesting its involvement in the secretion of DV. Some genes whose down-regulation enhanced levels of DV RSPs in the supernatant are involved in endocytosis, such as the three dynamins which show a 2 to 4 fold increase in dengue RSPs secretion. These proteins are involved in the budding process or in the transport of vesicles [31]. Such an enhancement might have been due, at least in part, to a blockade in the re-internalization of secreted RSPs by HeLa-prME cells. Although further experiments are required to confirm the screening data, our study validates the use of DV RSPs-producing HeLa-prME cell line in combination with the CLDB-based quantification strategy as a promising system to facilitate the identification of cellular factors involved in DV secretion.",

RSPs of the four serotypes were first produced in 293T cells by transient expression of prME genes. Particles were purified and detected by Western blotting using either the anti-E 4E11 monoclonal antibody or a mixture of sera from four patients who were infected by all dengue serotype (Figure 8A\u2013B). With the anti-E 4E11 antibody, monomeric and dimeric forms of the DV1 E protein could be readily detected whereas weaker signals were observed for the other three serotypes, because of limited affinity of the antibody (Figure 8A) [32]. E proteins of all DVs were detected using the mixture of sera (Figure 8B) with a signal of similar intensity, which suggested that RSPs of four serotypes could be generated to comparable levels. Monomeric E proteins of four serotypes displayed slightly different electrophoresis mobility, which could be due to a differential level of N-glycosylation. E glycoproteins of DV1 and DV3 have two N-glycosylation sites at Asn 67 and Asn 153, whereas those of DV2 and DV4 have only one at Asn 67 [33]. Dimeric E protein was observed in DV1, DV3 and DV4 but not in DV2. Besides E, the prM protein was also detected in RSPs produced by transient transfected 293T cells. Recently, we have established HeLa-prME and 293T-prME cell lines of DV1, DV2 and DV3 using the same procedure described for DV1 HeLa-prME. We have compared the maturation of RSPs produced by both cell types using SDS-PAGE and silver staining of the gel (Figure 8C). Supernatants from parental HeLa and 293T cells were used as controls in the experiment. We found that, whereas only a small fraction of prM was cleaved in the RSPs produced by 293T-prME cell lines, cleavage of prM was much more effective in RSPs from the HeLa-prME cell lines. This result indicates that efficacy of maturation is cell type dependent. RSPs of the four serotypes were further analyzed by sucrose gradient. As for DV1, RSPs of DV2, DV3 and DV4 were concentrated in fractions containing 20% to 30% sucrose (Figure 8D). Altogether, our results demonstrated that the strategy of codon optimization was successful in leading to the production of RSPs of all serotypes with comparable efficacy and similar sedimentation properties.",

Previous studies had reported the production of DV RSPs in which the glycoproteins were mutated either to avoid host cell fusion or to delete the ER retention signal. For example, DV1 RSPs were not secreted effectively and DV2 RSPs could not form unless the transmembrane domain of the E glycoprotein, which contains an ER retention motif was replaced with that of JEV [22], [23], [34]. Our ability to obtain the efficient production of RSPs of all serotypes without any change in the amino acid sequence is likely the result of codon optimization for expression in mammalian cells, which has been proven to be an effective method to increase the expression level of glycoproteins from various viruses [35], [36]. Thus, gene optimization significantly enhanced expression of prME glycoproteins in transfected cells, and this over-expression increased both RSP production and secretion. However, it is also possible that using other viral strains may result in different efficacy of RSPs production, regardless of codon optimization. To our knowledge, this is the first report of RSPs using the native prM and E envelope proteins for the four serotypes of DVs in mammalian cells.",

Sucrose gradient and sedimentation analysis demonstrated that the DV1 RSPs are concentrated in fractions containing 20\u201330% sucrose and are sensitive to detergent treatment. Although prM/E heterodimers were not found in our experiments, possibly because prM/E interaction is weak, we observed processing of prM into M protein in HeLa-prME cells. This cleavage was sensitive to NH4Cl treatment, which inhibits acidification of the trans-Golgi compartment and, hence, the activity of furin protease. Newly synthesized E proteins first form heterodimers with prM proteins in the ER of host cells and then rearrange as homodimers during the process of secretion [37], [38]. The rearrangement from heterodimer to homodimer was first thought to require cleavage of prM by furin in the trans-Golgi to form M and soluble pr proteins [39]. A recent study, however, has shown that such rearrangement is mainly caused by the progressive acidification of the milieu along the secretory pathway, which facilitates prM cleavage by furin [6], [10]. If rearrangement is a pre-requisite for prM cleavage to occur, it could explain, at least in part, why E homodimers were still observed in our study following treatment with the acidotropic reagent NH4Cl. The precise mechanism underlying their presence in RSPs under these experimental conditions, however, requires further investigation. Finally, we found by pulse-chase experiments that 8 hours are necessary for production and secretion of RSPs. Altogether, these results show that mature DV1 RSPs are efficiently produced by the stable HeLa-prME cell line.",

By immuno-staining of fixed cells and fluorescence microscopy, we have shown that most of the E protein is localized in the ER compartment, where dengue glycoproteins are synthesized [1]. The fact that we did not detect any significant signal of E in ERGIC and Golgi apparatus could be explained by a very low amount of protein in these organelles. In these conditions, saturating signals in the ER would mask its detection in other compartments along the secretory pathway. The fluorescent microscopy results were in accordance with our electron microscopy data. Analysis of cell sections by transmission electron microscopy has revealed that E proteins in the ER are associated with both round particles and tubular structures. The tubules could either be intermediate forms of RSPs assembly or result from accumulation of prM and E proteins in the ER. Budding of virions from cellular membranes depends on assembly of viral structural proteins that generate pushing and/or pulling forces simultaneously to induce curvature of membranes, which is necessary for particle formation and membrane fission. It is possible that assembly of overexpressed prM and E proteins in the ER allows formation of long tubules but that the fission event is a limiting factor. The secretion pathway was also investigated by temperature block or pharmacological experiments. Incubation at either 15\u00b0C, to stop traffic between the intermediate compartment and the cis-Golgi, or at 20\u00b0C, to block exit from the trans-Golgi network, or BFA treatment, to block the exit from ER, significantly reduced secretion of RSPs. These results demonstrate that RSPs traffic through ER, ERGIC and Golgi compartments before being secreted out of the cell.",

We have validated our assay by using a siRNA library preferentially targeting genes involved in cellular transport. As expected, a number of genes involved in the secretory pathway resulted in reduced release of RSPs in the cell supernatant, whereas other factors were associated with an opposite effect. Clearly, the identification of cellular factors involved in the egress process will be helpful to understand the maturation of DV and its pathogenicity.
