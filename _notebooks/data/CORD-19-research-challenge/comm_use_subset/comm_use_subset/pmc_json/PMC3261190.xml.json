Pigs are also susceptible to and show clinical signs when infected with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus (referred to hereafter as H1N1pdm) [12], which emerged in April 2009 in North America [13], arising at least in part from contemporaneous SIV. To date H1N1pdm has been found in a few swine farms [12], [14], [15], which further demonstrates a two-way process of both gene and virus trafficking between humans and pigs. Though H1N1pdm has remained antigenically and genetically stable in humans since its emergence, a novel reassortant SIV containing a H1N1pdm-like NA and seven other genes from triple-reassortant H1N2 and European \u201cavian-like\u201d H1N1 viruses was identified in early 2010 [16], and that same year H1N1pdm was shown to be evolving genetically at a faster pace in pigs than it was in humans [12], [15], [17]. Effective control of circulating influenza viruses in swine populations is key to reducing consequent genesis of novel pandemic strains that threaten the health of both humans and animals.",

            "text": "Studies have been conducted to identify proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-12, and IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b3, which are upregulated in lung or bronchoalveolar secretions in SIV-infected pigs [18], [19], [20], [21] and may be correlated with clinical manifestations. In an alveoli macrophage-depleted pig model, macrophages appeared to be indispensible to effective clearance of SIV from lungs. A higher frequency of cytotoxic T, \u03b3\u03b4 T, and Treg cells were also detected in infected pig lungs [18], which together with the induction of cytokines, contribute to pathogenesis of influenza infection in pigs. Exploring the mechanism of regulation of host responses is crucial for understanding the pathogenesis of SIV and for controlling swine influenza in pigs. Macrophages residing beneath the respiratory epithelium and surrounding alveoli are part of the first line defenses against influenza viruses. During influenza viral replication in bronchial epithelial cells, macrophages are one of the earliest targets to be infected. Together with dendritic cells, macrophages coordinate innate immune responses, which subsequently lead to adaptive immunity by initiating antigen presentation and lymphocyte activation. Macrophages are indispensable in alveolar host defense and controlling influenza virus in pulmonary organs in pigs [22]. While protective in launching host antiviral responses and restricting virus spread, induced proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines are also the cause of pathogenicity for the host and may lead to acute respiratory failure (ARF), a major cause of death in highly pathogenic H5N1 or H1N1pdm-infected humans [23]. Needless to say, the roles of macrophages are critical to pathogenicity as well as host protection in SIV-infected pigs. However, little is known about the mechanisms of how host responses are regulated in pigs or their macrophages.",

In this report, we will demonstrate that swine macrophages are susceptible to infection by H1N1pdm. We will show a unique pattern of proinflammatory cytokine responses to the infection, which are distinctly regulated by swine mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. We have also observed cross-talk between MAP kinase and NF\u03baB pathways, and our data indicate that MAP kinase ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 may impact the activation of NF\u03baB through the induction of RIG-1, leading to IFN-\u03b2 induction in H1N1pdm-infected swine macrophages.",

The sampling procedure was performed in accordance with the rules set by the Institutional Review Board at the Hospital. The eight genomic segments of this virus have been fully sequenced and the raw data are deposited at Genbank under accession numbers JQ173100 through JQ173107. The virus was grown in 9-day-old embryonating chicken eggs; virus allantoic fluid (VAF) was harvested 48 hrs after inoculation, then titrated with standard haemagglutination tests (HA) and plaque assays in MDCK cells for HA and infectious viral titers, respectively [24]. For viral infection, the 3D/4 cells were trypsinized, resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS, and plated on 6-cm tissue culture plates at 5\u00d7106 cells per plate 12 hrs before infection. The cells were infected with H1N1pdm inocula in VAF at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. After 1 hr of adsorption, the virus inocula were discarded and 3 ml of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium containing TPCK-trypsin (1 \u00b5g/ml, Sigma) was added. The cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for various time points before cell lysates or total RNA extraction were prepared.",

This result demonstrated that H1N1pdm retains the ability to infect and replicate in swine macrophages, and can reach 1.8\u00d7104 PFU/ml as shown in a replicative curve (Fig. 1B). Apoptosis occurred and proceeded through the course of the infection, as we observed cleaved/activated caspase-9 as well as the emergence of downstream executioner caspases-6, -7, and -3, which eventually destroyed the infected swine macrophages (Fig. 1C). Clearly, cytochrome c was released into the cytosol (Fig. 1E), which activated mitochondria-mediated intrinsic apoptosis as early as 3 hrs post infection. Bak, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, was upregulated as detected in the infected cells (Fig. 1D), and may be involved in the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria in swine macrophages.",

We further examined the induction of RIG-1 and MDA-5 and their relevance to MAP kinases. To do this, we pre-treated the cells with inhibitors of MAP kinases. As shown in Figure 8C, the induction of RIG-1 was completely abolished by the inhibition of ERK1/2 or JNK1/2 inhibitors, and to a much lesser extent, by the p38 inhibitor, suggesting that the induction of RIG-1 was dependent on ERK1/2 and JNK1/2, but not as much on p38. This differentially regulated pattern of RIG-1 induction by ERK1/2, p38, and JNK1/2 was similar to the suppression of NF\u03baB phosphorylation/activation by MAP kinases (Fig. 8A), suggesting that the induction of RIG-1 was associated with ERK1/2 or JNK1/2 activation, but to a much lesser extent with p38. Since NF\u03baB could be downstream activated by RIG-1/IPS-1 [29], [30], we postulate that ERK1/2 or JNK1/2 may activate NF\u03baB through the activation of RIG-1/IPS-1 during H1N1pdm infection in pig macrophages.",

In contrast, IL-1\u03b2 was not induced, and was barely detectable in pig macrophages. This pattern differs from that in bronchoalveolar secretions of SIV-infected pigs in which IL-1\u03b2 was induced but IL-8 was not [19], [20], [21], [22], [25]. The different cell types involved (macrophages and epithelial cells) may account for the difference. It has previously been reported that in human immune cells and patients a weak innate immune response, evidenced by a poor induction of proinflammatory and antiviral cytokines including IFN-\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, has been observed in human monocyte-derived DCs and macrophages infected with H1N1pdm, compared to seasonal H1N1 infection [31]. Highly pathogenic H5N1 viral infection in human macrophages induced higher expression of IL-6 and CCL5 (RANTES) than pH1N1 [32], which may explain generally mild clinical disease among H1N1pdm-infected patients.

However, our data clearly demonstrate that ERK1/2 plays a major role in the regulation of IFN-\u03b2 in pig macrophages, which may indicate that the regulation of IFN differs in different cell types. We noted that basal level activities of both ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 were constitutively present in non-infected 3D/4 cells, which may be important in the induction of proinflammatory and antiviral cytokines at the early stages of infection.

Basal level phosphorylation of both ERK1/2 and JNK1/2, which may affect certain cytokine production, would be minimal in primary monocytes. However, specific inhibitors used in the study completely wiped out phosphorylation of both ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 (Fig. 4). The effect of MAP kinase phosphorylation and activation on the regulation of affected cytokines as observed in our study with the inhibitors is, therefore, valid, even though the cells were not primary cultures.",

The Fas-mediated extrinsic apoptotic pathway is apparently triggered by TNF family ligands. While both FasL and TNF-\u03b1 were induced vigorously upon the viral infection, induction of TRAIL was rather mild in H1N1pdm-infected swine macrophages. We knew previously that FasL and TNF-\u03b1 were barely detectable, while the level of TRAIL remained high prior to the infection based on our realtime RT-PCR data (Ct) (Xing et al., unpublished data). We can therefore presume that H1N1pdm-induced apoptosis may be mainly attributed to FasL and TNF-\u03b1, while pig macrophages could be resistant to TRAIL, since the cells remained intact despite the presence of a high level of TRAIL before infection. Furthermore, we were also able to determine that both ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 were involved in the induction of FasL, TNF-\u03b1, and TRAIL. FasL is also regulated by ERK1 in chicken macrophages infected with an H9N2 avian influenza virus [34].",

            "text": "Both toll-like receptors (TLR) and RNA helicases, such as RIG-1 and MDA-5, are critical to antiviral innate immunity [35], [36]. As a cytosolic sensor, RIG-1 binds to dsRNA and viral ssRNA that contain a 5\u2032-triphosphate not present in host RNA, and then is recruited to mitochondrial protein IPS via the CARD domain, leading to activation of NF\u03baB, IRF-3/-7, and induction of IFN [37], [38], [39]. RIG-1 can be induced by viral infection [40]. In this study, we observed a robust induction of RIG-1 and MDA-5 in H1N1pdm-infected swine macrophages, which appeared to be suppressed completely by inhibitors of ERK1/2 or JNK1/2, but to be a much lesser extent, by the inhibitor of p38. This indicates that the induction of RIG-1 or MDA-5 depends on the activation of ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 in pig macrophages. We postulate a mechanism, therefore, that the cross-talk between MAP kinase and NF\u03baB pathways is through the regulation of RIG-1 and maybe MDA-5, and that ERK1/2 controls the activation of NF\u03baB, leading to the induction of IFN in swine macrophages.",
