The peripheral ER is composed of a single continuous membrane that branches from the nuclear envelope and consists of two main structural domains, flat membrane cisternae (also called sheets) and tubules, which are dynamic structures (6). ER sheets are covered with ribosomes and support synthesis, translocation, and folding of proteins. Tubules, whose function is less well understood, associate with significantly fewer ribosomes and may be sites for lipid synthesis and communication with other organelles (7). It is not known how the ER maintains this dynamic network of sheets and tubules, although the process requires contributions from motor proteins, the cytoskeleton, proteins that mediate ER-ER fusion, and membrane-bending proteins (8). Collectively, ER shape is influenced by a surprisingly small set of proteins (9).",

These viruses infect humans throughout their lifetime (19) and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of celiac disease (20). Reovirus replication, transcription, and assembly occur in large cytoplasmic structures termed viral inclusions (VIs) (21). Inclusions were generally thought to be membrane-free structures, but they contain smooth membranes attached to mitochondria (22). ER cisternae surround reovirus inclusions, and ribosomes are distributed within these structures (21, 22). These findings point to the potential participation of the ER in VI formation and architecture.",

Fluorescence confocal microscopy showed that reovirus infection triggers a massive transformation of the ER that becomes thin, undulated, and fragmented (Fig. 1A and B). Three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of serial transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that groups of thin, undulated ER tubules concentrate around VIs (Fig. 1C). Similar findings were obtained in studies of reovirus-infected mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). ER membranes were observed surrounding and inside VIs using confocal microscopy (Fig. S1A). TEM of VIs at various magnifications showed rough ER (RER) surrounding and contacting the VIs, and membrane fragments were often seen inside VIs (Fig. S1B).",

Colocalization of dsRNA with PDI also was observed (Fig. 2E). To localize viral RNA synthesis relative to VIs, we assessed bromouridine (BrU) incorporation via immunogold labeling of Tokuyasu cryosections (Fig. 2F). BrU labeling was observed in inclusions associated with viral particles, marking viral RNA that had accumulated during the 5-h labeling window (Fig. 2F). These particles are viral cores in which genome replication takes place (28, 29) but also likely mature virions, which may retain signal due to the prolonged labeling window. BrU labeling also was associated with membranes inside VIs (Fig. 2F). Although BrU was maintained in the cell culture medium for 5 h, BrU signal was found only in VIs. A total of 258 labeled structures in VIs from 5 cells were photographed. BrU labeling was detected in viral particles (35%) and membranes (46%) as well as in some labeled structures that were not clearly identified (19%). Double labeling with antibodies specific for BrU and the \u03bb3 viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which resides in the virion core, showed that inside VIs, both antibodies label viral particles (Fig. 2G and H) and membrane fragments (Fig. 2G, inset). These results suggest that the ER-derived, tubulovesicular membranes inside VIs support viral replication and assembly. Considering that genome replication of Reoviridae viruses occurs inside viral cores (28, 29), the significance of membrane fragments labeled with anti-dsRNA or anti-BrU antibodies inside VIs is uncertain. Nonetheless, our findings raise the possibility that reovirus genome segments associate with membranes prior to assortment into viral particles inside VIs.",

HeLa cells engineered to express mCherry fused to \u03bcNS residues 1 to 230 and metallothionein (MT) (mCherry-\u03bcNS-MT) were adsorbed with reovirus, incubated with gold and silver, fixed, and embedded in resin. Ultrathin sections were stained and imaged using TEM (Fig. 5D and S4). Gold-silver particles bound to MT revealed the precise location of MT-tagged \u03bcNS molecules. We observed that prior to VI assembly, mCherry-\u03bcNS-MT distributes with vesicles near the nucleus where the mCherry fluorescent signal concentrates (Fig. 5D); mCherry-\u03bcNS-MT gold-silver molecules also distributed to thin, strangled ER cisternae where they distribute with near-uniform spacing (Fig. 5E). Together with the confocal images shown in Fig. 5C, this finding suggests a role for \u03bcNS in ER fragmentation. Results from gene silencing experiments using either \u03c3NS- or \u03bcNS-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in reovirus-infected cells showed only minor ER remodeling. This finding is consistent with the observation that \u03bcNS expression is diminished following \u03c3NS silencing and vice versa (Fig. S5). The ER morphological changes caused by reovirus infection or ectopic expression of \u03c3NS and \u03bcNS were quantified microscopically (Fig. 6). In this analysis, \u03c3NS causes a thinning of the tubular ER, whereas \u03bcNS disrupts the branches of the thin tubules and cleaves those structures into small pieces. At later stages of infection, the ER collapses and aggregates, leaving large gaps in the cytosol.",

In polarized intestinal Caco-2 cells, rotavirus particles enter ER cisternae on the periphery of rotavirus factories, which are called viroplasms. Virions later exit the ER and incorporate into small smooth vesicles that are transported to the cell surface. This nonconventional vesicular transport mechanism bypasses the Golgi complex and mediates rotavirus nonlytic egress (34). Rotavirus RNA synthesis occurs in viroplasms (35), which are dynamic structures that move perinuclearly during infection and fuse with each other in a process dependent on microtubules (36, 37). To generate a unifying model of Reoviridae inclusion morphogenesis, it will be important to determine whether viroplasms formed during rotavirus infection (as well as the factories formed by other members of the Reoviridae) also consist of membranes.",

In this regard, only a few cellular proteins are known to participate in ER transformation during viral infection. Reticulons, which are ER-shaping proteins, function in the assembly and stabilization of spherules containing viral replication complexes of brome mosaic virus (38). Reticulons also induce tubules and vesicles of positive curvature and enhance replication of enteroviruses (39). Rab18, a small GTPase that cycles between the cytosol, ER, and lipid droplets, participates in the recruitment of lipid droplets to hepatitis C virus replication sites in ER membranes, bringing together several components required for viral replication and morphogenesis (40). Finally, the ER-resident vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)-associated protein and oxysterol-binding protein, a lipid transfer protein located at ER-Golgi membrane contact sites, are used by several RNA viruses to mediate lipid exchange between the ER and other organelles (41, 42). These lipid flows modify membrane composition and stabilize viral replication complexes (43). However, viral proteins that induce ER remodeling are not known.",

Reovirus nonstructural proteins \u03c3NS and \u03bcNS are the minimal viral components required to assemble inclusions. Although the precise functions of these proteins are not clear, each is required for viral genome replication (44). Our study demonstrates that the ER remodeling necessary to build reovirus inclusions is mediated by these proteins. By expressing these proteins together or individually in the absence of viral infection, we found that \u03c3NS transforms the ER into thin tubules, while \u03bcNS eliminates branches and fragments the tubules into small pieces. Both proteins likely modify the ER simultaneously during infection, with \u03c3NS inducing tubulation and \u03bcNS disturbing the three-way junctions to produce unbranched, thin tubules, followed by scission of the tubules into smaller fragments (Fig. 7). Thinning of the ER by \u03c3NS may generate tension in the tubules just before fragmentation. Since \u03bcNS also can mediate formation of thin tubules, the synergistic effect of both proteins in thinning the ER likely facilitates tubule fragmentation by \u03bcNS. \u03c3NS and \u03bcNS could transform the ER by interacting with lipids in ER membranes or interfering with ER-shaping proteins, such as reticulons, Rab GTPases, or lunapark (8). \u03bcNS also could target proteins at the three-way junctions such as atlastins (45). Although confocal and superresolution STED microscopy showed that during infection \u03c3NS and \u03bcNS distribute to the ER in abundance, the protein concentration required for the observed ER remodeling need not be large. For example, occupation of as little as 10% of the tubular ER surface by bending proteins can induce pronounced ER curvature in yeast (46).",

The large membrane surface generated by ER fragmentation would provide an adequate shelter for reovirus replication complexes, which are protected inside viral cores (18, 47), as well as the reovirus translation machinery (21). We hypothesize that (i) viral cores actively replicating the genome are bound to membranous tubules, (ii) newly synthesized viral RNAs exit the cores and attach to these membranes via specific interactions with viral proteins, and (iii) assembly of the inner core and outer capsid to build progeny viral particles occurs around vRNPs anchored to these sites (Fig. 7). High-resolution studies showing the precise localization and movement of molecules inside VIs will be required to understand how viral genome replication and particle assembly are coupled inside the VIs.",

(B) Comparative analysis of ER alterations under different experimental conditions. Cells at 14 h postinfection and 24 h posttransfection were included in the quantification. This quantitative analysis confirms that \u03c3NS causes a thinning of the tubular ER, whereas \u03bcNS disrupts the branches of the thin tubules and fragments those structures into small pieces. At later stages of infection, the ER collapses and aggregates, leaving large gaps in the cytosol.",

(B) \u03bcNS binds to thin tubules, eliminates their branches, and severs them into small membranous pieces that aggregate, attach to the remodeled ER, and form VIs. Inside inclusions, replicating viral cores and newly synthesized vRNPs bind to membranes that most likely serve as assembly sites for new viral particles.
