MERS-CoV transmission had been known to occur via animals-to-humans; however, subsequent cases of human-to-human transmission have resulted in households and health care facility outbreaks have been documented [2\u20138]. The disease appears to have been transmitted from camels to humans, and recent studies have revealed an association among the virus found in humans with that found in camels [9]. Additionally, some studies have found antibodies to the virus in camels located in Africa and the Middle East [10]. In 2012, dozens of cases of people infected with MERS-CoV were reported in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) [9]. It has been reported that the disease has been fatal in 40% of confirmed cases [11].",

It is suspected that people with pre-existing chronic medical conditions (comorbidities) are more prone to being infected by the illness or to developing a severe case resulting in fatality [12]. Patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes, chronic lung disease and heart conditions especially older males are at higher risk [13, 14]. Strong links between health-care facilities and the outbreak of the disease has also been found in Jeddah, where the majority of patients were in contact with other patients or health-care workers [15]. Elsewhere, the transmission of MERS-CoV in household contacts revealed that an outcome of approximately 5% as the rate of secondary transmission occurred at home [12].",

The epidemic has understandably caused serious travel panic among the general public as well as among health-care workers and policy makers worldwide. Going by the number of new cases of international occurrence of MERS-CoV outside the Arabian Peninsula [19], the question that should be on everyone\u2019s mind right now is, especially since the disease was reported in South Korea, is what is the likelihood of similar outbreaks in countries in close proximity with the origin of the disease?",

The analyses of the disease outbreaks will be a versatile tool for studying and understanding transmission and spread of the disease. It will be useful in cubing its upsurge, and possibly its containment or eradication. Yesterday, it was AIDS, today Ebola, MERS-CoV and Zika. What will it be tomorrow? It is, therefore, a matter of urgency to examine the likelihood of fatality as a result of MERS, keeping in mind the associations of individual- and work-related risk factors with the disease. The present paper aims to use geoadditive regression model [21] to elucidate the epidemiological risk factors and geographical distribution of the transmission and severity of the outbreak. Specifically, we investigated the effect of comorbidity and other individual- and work related- level risk factors including the geographical spread of mortality from MERS-CoV across the regions of KSA.",

SaTScan is widely used for local cluster detection, which is good for detecting large clusters as well as to evaluate outliers when the outlier pattern is very strong or a small maximum search window is used [28]. The idea of Poisson model based SaTScan circular version is to recognize sets of regions where the disease count is significantly larger than expected [29]. SaTScan\u2019s Poisson log likelihood ratio statistics was applied to regional aggregated MERS counts in circular windows of increasing radius centered at each region centroid with a maximum cluster size of provinces covering 50% of the national population. Clusters with the largest test statistics were tested for statistical significance. This significance was assessed using the default 999 Monte Carlo trials drawn under the null hypothesis that the observed case count represents the census distribution. If the p-value derived by ranking a test statistic calculated from observed data against the 999 statistics calculated similarly for the Monte Carlo trials was below our alpha level of 5%, then the observed cluster was considered significant [27\u201329]. Additionally, the Wang\u2019s q-Statistics [30, 31] was used to test the global stratified spatial heterogeneity of occurrence of MERS disease. In all analyses, p-values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant in all tests.",

Our research findings and those similar, further warrant the need for effective and successful campaigns to combat chronic illness in the ageing population, not only to reduce mortality and defenselessness against novel and emerging infections, but also to improve the quality of life of these individuals. This is yet another reminder that older and sicker patients are the most vulnerable of all and, thus, require that extra care and watchfulness. Additionally, what makes the situation even more serious is that with today\u2019s unhealthy routine, including occupational and sedentary lifestyle and the abundance of processed and fast foods, more and more people are prone to develop serious comorbidities at a younger age. The Gulf region is indeed not immune to all that as childhood obesity, diabetes and other non-communicable diseases are showing no signs of slowing down. A study from Saudi Arabia showed that more than 50% of Saudi people older than 50 years have diabetes [43]. However, in the studies by Assiri et al., [12] and Mackay et al., [13] the large number of people with MERS-CoV infection and chronic disease might have been due to the hospital outbreak where patients were first admitted. Our results are inline with a recent case-control study where previous medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, heart disease, and smoking, were each independently associated with MERS-CoV disease [14]. Further case-control studies are needed to define the effect of comorbidities on susceptibility to, and associated mortality from, MERS-CoV infection.",
