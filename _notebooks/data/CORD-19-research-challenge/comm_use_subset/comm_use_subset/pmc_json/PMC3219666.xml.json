The latter method [8], which was based on the spike gene region of the FCoV genome, is a multiplex-nested PCR using 2 \u03bcL of the first PCR product as the template and nested primers [5] for discrimination of Type I and II FCoVs.

All six Korean type II FCoVs (08K-609, 08K-656, 08K-1154, 08K-1553, 08K-559/II and 08K-1429/II) was shown to be originated from the same lineage as F20-54-II isolated from Japan (Figure 2).",
