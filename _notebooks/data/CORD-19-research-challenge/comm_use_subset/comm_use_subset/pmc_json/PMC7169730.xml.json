            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV) was first detected in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, and it causes severe acute respiratory illness with fever, cough and shortness of breath (Zaki, van Boheemen, Bestebroer, Osterhaus, & Fouchier, 2012). Up to date, it has caused 1952 human infections, including 693 related deaths (World Health Organization (WHO), 2017). Dromedaries are the natural reservoir of MERS\u2010CoV (Sabir et al., 2016). However, other animal species such as non\u2010human primates (rhesus macaques and common marmosets), members of the family Camelidae (alpacas and llamas), rabbits and pigs have been demonstrated to be susceptible to MERS\u2010CoV infection (Crameri et al., 2016; Falzarano et al., 2014; Haagmans et al., 2015; Munster, de Wit, & Feldmann, 2013; Vergara\u2010Alert, van den Brand, et al., 2017; de Wit et al., 2013, 2017). The finding that pigs can be infected with MERS\u2010CoV would suggest that other Suidae might be susceptible to the virus. Indeed, common warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus), bushpig (Potamochoerus larvatus) and wild boars are commonly found in the Greater Horn of Africa or the Middle East, sharing the same habitats and water sources with dromedaries (Cumming, 2008; Vergara\u2010Alert, Vidal, Bensaid, & Segal\u00e9s, 2017). A recent study in alpacas demonstrated efficient animal\u2010to\u2010animal transmission (Adney, Bielefeldt\u2010Ohmann, Hartwig, & Bowen, 2016) but, to our knowledge, evidence for transmission between animals from other species has not been reported. To study whether MERS\u2010CoV might be transmitted between pigs, an experimental transmission study in this animal model was designed and performed under direct and indirect contact settings.",

All MERS\u2010CoV\u2010experimentally infected animals (P1\u2013P5) shed viral RNA at least from 1 to 4 days PI, and three of five pigs had detectable viral RNA until 7 days PI (Figure 2a). Most importantly, all five animals shed infectious virus during the first 4 days PI (Figure 2b). Viral RNA was detected in four of five cohoused, direct contact animals (G2) at least one time PI. The MERS\u2010CoV RNA load of G2 pigs, however, was lower than those of G1 (Figure 2a). No viral RNA or infectious virus was detected in swabs from G3 (P11\u2013P15) and control pigs (P16\u2013P18).To test whether seroconversion occurred, serum samples were tested with a specific recombinant MERS\u2010CoV S1\u2010ELISA and for neutralizing antibodies against MERS\u2010CoV. All five MERS\u2010CoV infected animals (P1\u2013P5) had detectable levels of S1\u2010antibodies 2\u2010 and 3\u2010weeks after the infection (Figure 2c). The specificity of the response was confirmed by virus neutralization assay. In P1\u2013P4 (but not in P5), serum neutralizing MERS\u2010CoV\u2010specific titres (1:40\u20131:160) were detected at 1\u2010 and 2\u2010week PI (Figure 2d). However, at week 3 PI, the virus neutralizing antibodies decreased (1:20\u20131:40). No MERS\u2010CoV\u2010specific antibodies were detected in serum of G2, G3 and control pigs. In environmental samples, very low levels of viral RNA were detected at different time points, with a peak at day 5 PI (Table 1).",

However, transmission studies have only been performed in alpacas. Here, no MERS\u2010CoV effective transmission was observed between pigs, as sustained by two main facts. First, viral RNA was detected from four of the five cohoused animals (G2), but at levels relatively similar to those found in environmental samples, and during a shorter period time than G1. Second, seroconversion was only observed in MERS\u2010CoV\u2010infected group pigs (G1), but specific antibodies were not detected in G2 or G3.",
