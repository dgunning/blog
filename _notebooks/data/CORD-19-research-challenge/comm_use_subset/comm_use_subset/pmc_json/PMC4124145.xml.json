The 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus spread worldwide through reassortment that exchanged a gene segment between pigs and humans [1]. Recently, cases of influenza A virus H7N9 transmitted from birds to humans have been reported [2]. The 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak originated from the transmission of a novel bat coronavirus [3]. For the sporadically endemic Ebola virus, bats are suspected to be the natural reservoir, but this is still controversial [4]. Vector-borne zoonoses caused by transmission of viruses through mosquitoes and ticks have also become a public health concern. The 1999 outbreak of West Nile virus (WNV) that occurred in New York was caused by the transmission of the WNV among birds, horses and humans via mosquitoes [5]. Similarly, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) was found to be due to a virus transmitted by ticks [6].",

The method is based on the assumption that valid hits, the match of viral sequences to viral genomic sequences, raise the probability of finding other similar genomic sequences in the BLAST search.

A previous study showed that the rodent host was infected with Luna virus, which belongs to the Old world arenaviruses\n[15]. Totally, 99.9% of the sequences were derived from eukaryotes, including sequences from the rodent host. The reptile host in dataset 2 was infected with Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (Figure 3B). This result was consistent with the closest virus described in the literature [16]. In dataset 2, 99.5% of the sequences were probably derived from the reptile host. According to the literature concerning dataset 3, the simian host was infected with a novel simian adenovirus, which is close to Simian adenovirus 3, Simian adenovirus 18 and Simian adenovirus 21 with about 55% pairwise nucleotide identity [17]. We found Simian adenovirus 49, Simian adenovirus 18 and Simian adenovirus 1 in dataset 3 (Figure 3C), suggesting results similar to those in the literature. Similarly, in dataset 3, most of the sequences (95.1%) were likely derived from the simian host.",

Therefore, we used the customized viral database for a BLAST search to investigate how much the computational time was reduced and whether the conventional LCA could identify the infecting viruses. In Figure 4, the top 3 assigned reads show the capturing of infecting viruses. However, most of the assigned taxa were false positives (Figure 4). At the 6th taxonomic level of assignments in dataset 1, 98.7% of the reads were assigned into Choristoneura occidentalis granulovirus and Spodoptera litura granulovirus, and only 0.4% (1,518/383,939) of them were assigned into Luna virus (Figure 4A). In the case of BLAST-NT, we failed to identify Luna virus but detected Old world arenaviruses, with 1,245 reads at the 5th taxonomic level, including the following relatives: Mobala virus, 125 reads; Morogoro virus, 73 reads; and Mopeia virus, 56 reads. In dataset 2, 8,387 reads were assigned into 141 viral taxa at the 7th taxonomic level, and 573 were assigned into Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (Figure 4B). In the case of BLAST-NT, 454 reads were assigned into Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. These results showed consistency between BLAST viruses and BLAST-NT. Of the 5,952 reads assigned into viral taxa at the 7th taxonomic level in dataset 3, 468 were assigned into Simian adenovirus 49 (Figure 4C). The most assigned taxon in BLAST viruses was Simian adenovirus 49, but 99 reads in BLAST-NT were assigned into the closest relative, Simian adenovirus 18. Although the assignments with BLAST-NT were more favorable than those with BLAST viruses, the coverage of the identified Simian adenovirus 49 was sufficient to perform the subsequent analysis. These results showed that the sensitivity of the LCA with BLASTN viruses outperformed the LCA with BLASTN-NT, suggesting that the BLAST search of the viral database was sufficient for subsequent analysis.",

The difficulty in applying this approach directly to virus identification was the increase of false positive assignments (Figure 4). We tested several ways to solve this problem. As shown in Additional file 1: Figure S1, changing the threshold of the E-value dependent on the size of the database is probably not effective for discriminating between true and false assignments. The criteria for evaluating breadth coverage, i.e. the proportion of reads mapped across the hit genomes and the depth coverage (the number of reads mapped at a position), also failed to identify the target viruses (Additional file 1: Figure S2). On the other hand, ELM analyzed how sequence similarity to the relatives changes. This extension of the LCA method suppressed the rise in false positive assignments. A limitation of ELM would be the false-negative errors because ELM cannot detect viruses distantly related to other relatives (Table 4). Therefore, viruses without relatives should be carefully handled without the inflation index.",

In surveillance for pathogenic viruses, taxonomic assignment of the host sequence is not necessary for the initial screening. For this, sensitivity for detecting viruses is particularly required. Our results suggest that ELM recovers most reads assigned to target viruses. Therefore, we can apply these results to further sophisticated analyses. ELM will contribute to analyses of NGS data for limited targets such as the direct diagnosis of viral infections.",
