            "text": "Macrophage (MO) apoptosis during Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection has focused much attention on its possible role in disease pathogenesis. A number of findings support this view; it has been shown that virulent mycobacterial strains are less apoptogenic than their attenuated counterparts [1] and MO proapoptotic genes are downregulated by virulent strains while the opposite occurs with avirulent mycobacteria [2]. In contrast with latent infection, in active TB patients the expression of genes that promote apoptosis is diminished [3]. These data and the identification of genes that inhibit MO apoptosis in some Mtb mutants [4] have added further support to the view that the ability of Mtb to prevent the apoptotic death of host cells is a virulence trait aimed to preserve its cellular niche. On the other hand, that MO apoptosis represents an innate immune response of the host is suggested by decreased viability of bacilli in apoptotic MO [5\u20137]. There is also evidence that dendritic cells that have ingested apoptotic MO infected by Mtb can activate T cells through a process known as cross-priming which results in the activation of CD8+ T cells [7, 8]. It is also of interest the identification of Mtb proapoptotic mutants that induce higher T cell immunity which favors the control of infection [9].",

Initially, it was characterized as extrinsic type, caspase-dependent apoptosis with TNF-\u03b1 activation [10, 11]. More recent studies have come to show that MO apoptosis in mycobacterial infection is a complex and variegated process. Some reports document the participation of the intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway. Infection with attenuated Mtb strains results in mitochondrial outer membrane permeability with release of cytochrome c and activation of caspase 9 [12, 13]. Recently, the endoplasmic reticulum stress and lysosome pathways have been implicated in macrophage apoptosis provoked by mycobacteria [14]. It has been also reported that host cell death might show features of necrosis particularly with increased bacillary loads [15]. These observations could suggest that mycobacteria instead of apoptosis favor necrosis as a mechanism of dissemination and survival.",

We undertook this study with the aim of knowing better the biochemical pathways used by LpqH to induce MO apoptosis, specially to know if mitochondrial factors were involved. LpqH is interesting for several reasons; it is one of the few mycobacterial proteins, which in addition to acyl groups possess mannose residues [20]. Recently, we demonstrated that LpqH behaves as an adhesin that interacts with the mannose receptor to promote phagocytosis of mycobacteria [21]. LpqH induces T cell-mediated immunity, although it might also behave as a TLR2 agonist that downregulates antigen presentation to T cells [22].",

The mouse mAb used were: to human TNFR1 (1 \u03bcg/mL, dilution 1/100), human TNFR2 (2 \u03bcg/mL, dilution 1/100), human Fas (1 \u03bcg/mL, dilution 1 : 100), and human FasL (0.5 \u03bcg/mL, dilution 1/100). After apoptosis induction, cells were extensively rinsed and incubated for 1 h with each of the above antibodies. For control, irrelevant isotype antibodies were used. Thereafter, cells were rinsed with PBS and incubated for 1 h with peroxidase-labeled goat or mouse anti-IgG antibodies diluted 1/1000. Finally, 100 \u03bcLof ABTS solution were added to the cells. Optical densities at 405 nm was read by an ELISA reader (Asys Expert Plus, HyTech, Austria).",

To investigate if this occurred in LpqH-treated MO, we carried out inhibition assays with blocking antibodies to these receptors. In cells preincubated with a mAb to human TLR2 and then exposed to 5 \u03bcg LpqH, there was a significant reduction in apoptosis levels (Figure 2; P < 0.01). This finding indicates that apoptosis is induced by the interaction of TLR2 with motifs present in the mycobacterial lipoprotein. Apoptosis of cells that were preincubated with a mAb to human TLR4 was not modified, a finding in keeping with the fact that this receptor is activated preferentially by LPS motifs and not by lipoproteins [25].

In contrast, membrane-bound FasL was significantly increased (P < 0.01; Figure 3(a)).

            "text": "In view of the implication of mitochondrial factors in the induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis, we considered possible that caspase-independent factors could be also involved in LpqH-induced MO death. Therefore, we carried out assays with the pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (Figure 6(a)). In cells treated with LpqH for 1 h, there was 49.08% reduction in apoptosis (P < 0.05), while in cells treated with LpqH for 24 h, apoptosis reduction was of only 19.41% (P < 0.05). This suggested a role for a caspase-independent mechanism. It is well established that after a variety of apoptotic stimuli, AIF is rapidly released from the mitochondria and relocated to the nuclei to induce chromatin condensation and cell death which is unresponsive to caspase inhibitors [32, 33]. Therefore, we investigated by immunoblot the subcellular distribution of AIF in cells treated with LpqH for 24 hr. In nuclei and cytosol, a doublet band was observed, one of them of 57 kDa, a molecular weight that corresponds to activated or truncated AIF (Figure 6(b)); the upper band corresponds to uncleaved AIF [32, 33]. To confirm these findings, we performed immunofluorescence with a CY5-labeled mAb to AIF; many confocal microscopy photographs taken at the central part of the cell were examined. In cells treated with LpqH for 1 and 24 h, translocation of AIF was seen in many nuclei as magenta fluorescent spots or massive fluorescence (Figure 6(c)); magenta fluorescence results from the colocalization of CY5 (red fluorescence) which labels AIF and DAPI nuclear staining (blue fluorescence). Unaffected or not treated control cells showed AIF emitting CY5 red fluorescence, localized to the cytoplasm, with a punctate pattern characteristic of mitochondrial labeling (Figure 6(c)). Epifluorescence was used to quantitate AIF nuclear translocation in 3 independent experiments; photographs were taken in several randomly chosen fields, and for quantitative analysis at least 500 cells per condition were scored as showing or not AIF in nuclei (Figure 6(d)); similar percentages of cells were positive for AIF at 1 (67.7%) and 24 h (59.5%).",

            "text": "Although the apoptogenic capacity of LpqH has been reported before [16, 17], this study gives new insight about the mechanisms involved. It is shown that both extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms, including AIF relocation, act together to provoke the apoptotic death of human MO challenged with LpqH. In the extrinsic or receptor-mediated pathway, a novel observation was the overexpression of membrane-bound FasL, a protein that is cleaved with high efficiency from the cell surface by metalloproteinases [26]. It is interesting that membrane-bound FasL is a considerably more potent inducer of apoptosis than soluble FasL [34]. This property could be relevant in TB since tuberculous granulomas contain numerous macrophages that express surface FasL [35]; this raises the possibility that these FasL armed cells may kill by direct contact Fas-expressing cells within the granuloma. Another new observation was the upregulation not only of TNF-\u03b1 but also of both TNFR1 and TNFR2 receptors; this increased expression was significant as shown by inhibition assays with blocking mAb which reduced apoptosis levels significantly. This finding poses the question of how TNFR2 participates in LpqH induced cell death considering that in contrast to TNFR1, TNFR2 lacks a death domain. It has been reported that TNFR2 may participate in apoptosis by inducing endogenous TNF-\u03b1,depleting antiapoptotic signals, or increasing TNFR1 expression [27, 28].",

The motifs in LpqH that active TLR2 are unknown; acyl groups in the lipoprotein are likely candidates, as suggested by studies with artificial bacterial lipoprotein motifs [36].

            "text": "An interesting finding of this study was the apparent cooperation found between extrinsic and intrinsic pathways to provoke MO apoptosis. Indeed, activation of caspase 9 and cytochrome c released from mitochondria into the cytosol were demonstrated. When a given apoptotic stimulus induces outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) permeability, cytochrome c is released from the mitochondria to the cytosol where it mediates apoptosome formation; this macromolecular complex results from the interaction of APAF-1, ATP, and procaspase 9, which is cleaved into its activated form. In turn, active caspase 9 cleaves and activates procaspase 3, thereby triggering the executioner phase of caspase-dependent apoptosis [29]. In addition, as shown by flow cytometry using the lipophilic fluorochrome DiOC6 a reduction of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential was found; this change indicates permeabilization of the inner membrane, an apoptosis feature less frequent than OMM permeabilization but frequently associated with cytochrome c release [37]. The mechanism interconnecting the extrinsic pathway with the mitochondrial pathway in apoptosis induction requires further study. It has been described that caspase 8 might cleave Bid (BH3-interacting domain death agonist), a proapoptotic Bcl2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) family member; then truncated Bid localizes to the OMM where it promotes Bax (Bcl-2-associated X protein) activation, resulting in release into the cytosol of proapoptotic or antiapoptotic molecules from the mitochondria [38].",

Since it is well recognized that mitochondria can also release factors involved in caspase-independent cell death [37], we considered this possible. This was also entertained by the limited effect of a pancaspase inhibitor to avoid apoptosis in LpqH-challenged cells. Among the proapoptotic molecules released with OMM permeability is AIF, which has been shown to be frequently involved in caspase-independent apoptosis [39]. AIF is a mitochondrial flavoprotein with a twofold function, in the mitochondria it participates in oxidative phosphorylation, a life function, and, when out of the mitochondria, it provokes cell death [39]. After an apoptotic stimulus, AIF can be cleaved by calpains or cathepsins yielding a truncated 57-kDa form which, once released in the cytosol, relocates to the nucleus to promote chromatinolysis and programmed cell death [33]. In this study, in cells treated with LpqH, AIF was seen by immunoblot in the nuclei and to a lesser extent in the cytosol. In both locations, two bands were detected, one of 57 kDa, possibly corresponding to truncated AIF. In addition, by epifluorescence and confocal microscopy, translocation of AIF to the nuclei of most cells was seen at 1 and 24 h. As far as the mechanisms involved in AIF release, it has been shown that overexpression of PARP-1 generates PAR polymers which colocalize with the mitochondria where they induce liberation of AIF to the cytosol with subsequent translocation to cell nuclei [40]. Another factor that may connect caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways is caspase 3, which might cleave nuclear PARP-1 [41].",

It also shows the high complexity of the cell death process and how extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis cooperate. The most interesting and previously unreported observation was the participation of the mitochondrial apoptosis factor (AIF) in the macrophage death triggered by a Mtb lipoprotein. It follows to study the molecular mechanisms and the significance of the cooperation between death-receptor and mitochondrial mediated apoptosis.",
