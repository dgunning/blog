The viruses associated with ARIs are classified as \u201cold respiratory viruses\u201d and \u201cnovel respiratory viruses.\u201d The \u201cold respiratory viruses\u201d include respiratory syncytial virus A/B (RSV A/B); influenza virus A and influenza virus B (InfV\u2010A, InfV\u2010B); parainfluenza virus 1\u20103 (PIVs 1\u20103); adenovirus (AdV); and rhinovirus (RV).3, 4 The \u201cnovel respiratory viruses\u201d were identified more recently and comprise metapneumovirus A/B (MPV A/B), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, coronavirus NL63, coronavirus HKU1 , coronavirus OC43, coronavirus 229E (CoV\u2010NL63, CoV\u2010HKU1, CoV\u2010OC43, and CoV\u2010229E), PIV\u20104, and bocavirus (BoV). In recent years, more respiratory viruses, such as enterovirus genus (EV), parechovirus genus (PeV), InfV\u2010A (H1N1), and influenza virus C , have appeared more frequently as the cause of ARIs.5 In addition to viral infections, bacteria like Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) have been the most associated bacteria with ARIs.6 Fungal ARIs in children are rare and are found mainly in immunocompromised patients.7\n",

            "text": "The acquisition and spreading of ARIs vary among study populations in different countries. This may be due to children\u2019s malnutrition, the low socioeconomic status of the country, cultural habits in the community, patient\u2019s immune deficiency, local/regional geographical and climate change, and the variability of the health care systems in public and private hospitals. Consequently, the morbidity related to ARIs is mostly observed in the developing world.8 On the other hand, the expanding number of pathogens identified as a causative agent of ARIs might be due to the introduction of molecular techniques such as the multiplex real\u2010time polymerase chain reactions (qPCR, qRT\u2010PCR) in routine. These assays have increased the sensitivity and specificity of detection and allow the identification of a wide range of viruses and bacteria in one reaction. This will be helpful for the better understanding of the pathogenesis of ARIs.9 However, in most developing countries, the application of multiplex assays has not been fully implicated in the routine laboratory testing due to their high costs. As far as the Arab Maghreb is concerned, laboratories perform mostly enzyme immunoassays, rapid diagnostic tests, or latex agglutination techniques for some frequent pathogens, but no routine tests using qPCR assays are generally available. Owing to the absence of detailed diagnostic testing, infections are managed empirically by antibiotic regimens, resulting in an overuse of broad\u2010spectrum antibiotics, favoring the development of bacteria (bacterial resistance).10\n",

No statistical significance was revealed between viral infection and patient's gender or age (P = 0.49 and P = 0.66, respectively). Supporting Information Table S1 describes the distribution of individual viral infection by gender and age: RSV A/B was the single virus found to be statistically associated with gender (38.0% RSV A/B male cases vs 28.3% RSV A/B female cases, P = 0.02) and MPV A/B, BoV, as well as AdV infections, increased with the increasing age of patients (more frequent within the G3 group, P < 0.001). Table 4 describes the distribution of S. pneumoniae infections according to the demographic data of the infected subjects. S. pneumoniae was found to be more frequent in infants (39.1% vs 19.0% of neonates, P < 0.001, OR = 2.75) and male cases (32.4% vs 28.3% female cases, P = 0.32, OR = 0.82). S. pneumoniae was found to be age\u2010dependent (P < 0.001): it was predominant in cases aged 6 to 12 months (41.8% vs 37.9% of cases aged 28 days to 6 months vs 19.0% of cases aged 0\u201028 days).",

The CoVs subtypes were described for the first time in Tunisia and revealed that CoV\u2010229E was the most frequently detected. In spite of the common knowledge that RSV A/B is the most common respiratory agent responsible for ARIs, RV was found to be more prevalent in this population, which highlights the interest of cost benefits studies concerning its implementation in the routine laboratory testing. Given the multiplicity of these findings, this study provides a useful starting point for a better understanding about the circulation of these pathogens in the area of Sousse and the seasonal/demographic attributable to viral/bacterial infection. It will contribute data relevant to the development of prevention strategies, which will help in clinical decisions and allow considering antiviral therapy in clinical routine.
