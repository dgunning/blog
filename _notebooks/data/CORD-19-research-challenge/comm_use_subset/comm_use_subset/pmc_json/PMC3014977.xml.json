There are four serotypes of dengue viruses (DEN types 1\u20134). Classic DF is a self-limited illness characterized by fever, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, and abdominal pain. Since the 1950s, a more severe form of the disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), has been recognized worldwide [1]. Patients who develop DHF typically have initial symptoms similar to those in DF patients, but develop cytokine-storm-like plasma leakage manifested by hemoconcentration, thrombocytopenia, ascites, and pleural effusion near the defeverence stage [2]. DHF pathogenesis has been attributed to viral virulence versus immune enhancement; however, that has been the subject of debate for many years [2], [3].",

One of these SNPs represents a guanine (G) to adenine (A) transition at position \u2212336 within the CD209 gene promoter (rs4804803). This variant has been associated with an increased risk for parenteral acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection [15], severity of dengue infection [16], and confered high susceptibility to tuberculosis in a South African cohort [17]. Nevertheless, Vannberg et al. found that G variant allele of rs4804803 was associated with protection against tuberculosis in individuals from sub-Saharan Africa [18]. This variant affects CD209 promoter activity with multiple transcription factor binding sites for the Sp1/GATA1/CACCC- and CAC-binding transcription factors in a transfection study [16]. As an in vitro study of promoter activity might not reflect an actual functional association, we aimed to test whether the rs4804803 SNP in the promoter region of CD209 was associated with the susceptibility to DF and/or DHF in Taiwanese, and whether monocyte-derived DCs from humans with various genotypes of rs4804803 would reveal differences in DC-SIGN membrane expression and implicate the viral replication and immune reactions after DEN infection.",

The TaqMan minor groove binder probe sequences were 5\u2032-TACCTGCCTACCCTT G-3\u2032, and 5\u2032-CTGCCCACC CTTG-3\u2032. The probes were labeled with the TaqMan fluorescent dyes VIC and FAM, respectively. The PCR was conducted in total volume of 15 \u00b5L using the following amplification protocol: denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 20 s, followed by annealing and extension at 60\u00b0C for one minute. After the PCR, the genotype of each sample was determined by measuring the allele-specific fluorescence in the ABI Prism 7500 Sequence Detection System, using SDS 1.1 software for allele discrimination (both Applied Biosystems). To validate the genotyping by real-time PCR analysis, 100 PCR products were subject to restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis with MscI restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA) and showed 100% identical result between these two genotyping systems.",

IP-10 has also been known to inhibit the binding ability of DEN in immortalized cells [28]. In our MDDC model, cells from individuals with AG genotype exhibited an augmented innate immune reaction, showing higher IP-10 production, post-infection (Figure 3C). Based on these results, we hypothesized that DEN-infected MDDCs with AG genotype produced higher levels of IP-10, which might block viral entry or viral replication in MDDCs. We used an anti-IP-10 neutralizing mAb to block endogenous IP-10 production by MDDCs. With both genotypes, the viral replication 24 h post DEN infection increased significantly more in the presence of neutralizing antibody than in the absence of neutralizing antibody (p = 0.034 and 0.040, respectively; Fig. 4A). IP-10 production by MDDCs from individuals with AG genotype significantly decreased (795.3\u00b1368.1 pg/mL vs. 273.8\u00b187.8 pg/mL; p = 0.037), but it did not decrease in MDDCs from individuals with AA genotype (329.8\u00b1114.2 pg/mL vs. 201.8\u00b187.0 pg/mL; p = 0.091; Fig. 4B). These results suggest that IP-10 produced by MDDCs is involved in the viral replication of DEN infection.",

The inconsistency between these studies regarding the protection for DHF or DF may result from two possibilities. First, the frequency of G allele in Chinese population is 3.8%; while in Thailand, it is 9.5\u201310.4% [16], [34]. Second, definition of DF and DHF might be also different. We defined DF and DHF according to WHO criteria, while in the study by Sakuntabhai et al., DF was defined by criteria of severe dengue fever syndrome with hemorrhage but no plasma leakage, excluding patients with flu-like symptoms or those having only fever. Moreover, the rs4804803 SNP was demonstrated to be in linkage disequilibrium with three other intronic polymorphisms in a Thai population, and these might also have contributed to the susceptibility of DHF [16].",

These results differ from a previous study by Loach et al. who demonstrated that the DC-SIGN expression levels on Raji cells after transfection of various DC-SIGN cDNA constructs were significantly correlated to the infection rate of DEN-1 [35]. DC-SIGN is an endocytic receptor shown to induce endocytosis of several pathogens, including dengue [36]\u2013[38]. The difference between these two studies might be due to different cell types and ex vivo culture systems. In our study, it was found that MDDCs from subjects with rs4804803 AG genotype had higher surface DC-SIGN expression with higher production of chemokines such as IP-10, which could limit DEN-2 replication (Fig. 4A); however, the higher surface DC-SIGN expression in subjects with AG genotype decreased remarkably 24 h post-infection (Fig. 2A). In the study by Loach et al., ectopic expression levels of DC-SIGN on Raji cells enhanced DEN-1 replication, which might be related to a higher quantity of receptors or lower production of IP-10 favoring DEN replication. Results from these studies suggest that the correlation of viral replication to higher or lower DC-SIGN expression depends on genetic factors in the host, cell type, and dynamic changes in the receptor following DEN infection.",

The addition of anti-IP-10 neutralizing antibody blocked the production of endogenous IP-10 and significantly enhanced the replication of DEN-2 (Fig. 4A).

This study provides new evidence that CD209 rs4804803 SNP, correlated to cell surface expression on dendritic cells, mediates augmented immune responses against DEN-2 infection and is implicated in the susceptibility of DHF. Further studies are warranted, particularly with regard to the genetic variants of CD209 on the DC polarization of adaptive immunity, and how they may promote or protect the development of DHF.",
