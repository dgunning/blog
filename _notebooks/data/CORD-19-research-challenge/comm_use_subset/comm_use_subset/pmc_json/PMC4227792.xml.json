            "text": "The RNA degrading exosome is a protein complex found in eukarya and archaea (1\u20133). It is composed of a structurally conserved nine-subunit core, which also shows similarities to bacterial polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), and contains additional subunits (4\u20139). The nine-subunit core of the eukaryotic exosome is essential but catalytically inactive and additional eukarya-specific subunits are responsible for the ribonucleolytic activity (9\u201311). In contrast, the archaeal nine-subunit exosome is a 3\u2032\u20135\u2032-exoribonuclease like PNPase (4,8) and strongly interacts with a protein annotated as DnaG (3,8,12,13). The archaeal exosome and bacterial PNPase have not only structural but also functional similarities \u2014 they degrade RNA phosphorolytically using inorganic phosphate and producing rNDPs, and in a reverse reaction they synthesize heteropolymeric RNA tails (8,14\u201316). It was suggested that the heteropolymeric RNA tails found in prokaryotes destabilize RNA enabling efficient binding of 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exoribonucleases including PNPase or exosome (15,17). Such destabilization mechanism is known for short poly(A)-tails synthesized by poly(A)-polymerase in enterobacteria (18,19) and by non-canonical poly(A)-polymerases in eukaryotes, where the polyadenylation of rRNA precursors is a prerequisite for their degradation by the eukaryotic exosome (20,21).",

            "text": "While the structure and function of the archaeal nine-subunit exosome is well understood (4,5,22\u201324), little is known about the role of archaeal DnaG in the context of the exosome. Its annotation is based on its central topoisomerase/primase (TOPRIM) domain (25,26) and nothing is known about the function of its N-terminal and C-terminal domains (NTD and CTD, respectively, Figure 1A). The archaeal nine-subunit exosome is formed by orthologs of the eukaryotic exosomal subunits Rrp41, Rrp42, Rrp4 and Csl4. The RNase PH-domain containing subunits Rrp41 and Rrp42 are arranged in a catalytically active hexamer, on the top of which a trimeric cap composed of the RNA-binding proteins Rrp4 and Csl4 is bound (Figure 1B; 4,5,22\u201324). The RNA-binding cap increases the efficiency of degradation of poly(A) and heteropolymeric RNA by the recombinant archaeal exosome (8,27\u201330). While in vivo the exosome contains both Rrp4 and Csl4 (31), in vitro complexes with homotrimeric, Rrp4 or Csl4 containing caps (Rrp4 exosome or Csl4 exosome) can be reconstituted (Figure 1B; 5,8). Their comparative analysis revealed that Rrp4 confers poly(A)-preference to the exosome of the hyperthermophilic and acidophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus (32), while Csl4 is needed for the interaction of the complex with DnaG (33; Figure 1B). Furthermore it was shown that DnaG preferentially binds poly(A) RNA in electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and increases the poly(A)-preference of the S. solfataricus exosome even in the presence of Rrp4 (33). This suggested that DnaG is a part of the RNA-binding platform of the S. solfataricus exosome and modulates its substrate specificity (33). However, it remained unknown how DnaG interacts with the exosome and with RNA substrates.",

            "text": "The tight interaction between archaeal exosome and DnaG was documented for several archaeal species (3,8,12,13), and fractionation of cell-free extracts followed by co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) strongly suggested that in S. solfataricus DnaG is an indispensable part of the exosome (31). On the other hand, DnaG is ubiquitous in all genome-sequenced archaea, while the exosome is missing in Methanococci, Halobacteria and some Methanomicrobia (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure S1; ref. 2,15,34). The high conservation of DnaG in archaea can be explained by the assumption that it plays an important role in RNA metabolism even in the absence of exosome, and/or by its putative role as a primase, in accordance to its annotation and recent biochemical data (35,36). The primase synthesizes de novo short RNA primers during chromosome replication. (37). Archaea possess a two-subunit primase PriS/PriL of eukaryotic type, which was characterized in vitro (38,39). This primase shows strong interactions with components of the archaeal replication network in pull-down assays with Thermococcus kodakarensis cell-free extracts, while the putative bacterial-type primase DnaG interacts with the exosome instead (13). However, it was published that DnaG of S. solfataricus exhibits primase activity in vitro, and this activity is decreased by mutations of conserved residues in the TOPRIM domain. Furthermore, an interaction was detected between S. solfataricus DnaG and the archaeal minichromosome maintenance (MCM) helicase in yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro pull-down assays. Based on this, it was suggested that archaeal DnaG may have a dual function in the cell, as a part of the exosome and as a bacterial-type primase (35,36).",

Assuming that a primase needs a DNA-binding domain while a protein important for RNA metabolism should possess an RNA-binding domain, we decided to characterize the NTD and CTD of S. solfataricus DnaG. We found that the NTD is a conserved archaeal RNA-binding domain cooperating with the TOPRIM domain in binding of RNA substrates, while the CTD is important for the binding to the exosome. Furthermore, we show that in vitro the exosome needs DnaG for post-transcriptional tailing of native rRNA, and that heteropolymeric tails enhance the degradation of rRNA transcripts. Our data strongly suggest that DnaG is a conserved archaeal RNA-binding protein, which participates in the degradation of stable RNAs in S. solfataricus.",

Native 5S rRNA was purified and labeled as follows. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol, separated on 10% polyacrylamide-urea gel and stained with ethidium bromide. The gel slice containing 5S rRNA was cut out, and RNA was eluted overnight in buffer composed of 500 mM NaOAc (pH 5.2), 1 mM EDTA and 2.5% phenol/chloroform. After phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, 5S rRNA was labeled at the 5\u2032-end using [\u03b1-32P] ATP. For the generation of internally labeled 5S rRNA (sequence according to the Comparative RNA Web Site and Project, http://www.rna.ccbb.utexas.edu, ref. 43), the 5S rRNA gene was amplified with the primers indicated in Supplementary Table S1 and in vitro transcription in presence of [\u03b1-32P] ribonucleoside uridine triphosphate (rUTP) was performed as described (30,33). The sequence of the 20 nt heteropolymeric tail added at the 3\u2032-end of the 3\u2032 16S rRNA and 5S rRNA transcripts is AAAGGGGGAUAAAAUAAAGA and corresponds to a tail previously detected in S. solfataricus (15).",

To learn more about the evolution of the archaeal DnaG proteins, we created a phylogentic tree based on the sequences of DnaG proteins from 39 representative archaeal species (Figure 2) and compared this tree to the 16S rRNA-based phylogenetic tree of 120 genome-sequenced archaea (Supplementary Figure S1). Both trees are congruent in the delineation of the phyla Euryarchaeota, Crenarchaeota, Nanoarchaota, Korarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota. Interestingly, the absence of exosome leads to major differences in the DnaG subtree of Euryarchaeota, which comprise exosome-containing and exosome-less representatives, when compared to the 16S rRNA tree. An informative example are Methanomicrobia. In the DnaG tree, exosome-less Methanomicrobia form a well-delineated cluster together with the exosome-less Halobacteria, while exosome-containing Methanomicrobia cluster together with Archaeoglobi and other exosome-containing archaea (Figure 2). This is in contrast to the 16S rRNA tree, where Methanomicrobia and Halobacteria are in a cluster well separated from Archaeoglobi and other Euryarchaeota (Supplementary Figure S1). Methanococci, which accordingly to the 16S rRNA tree are distantly related to Methanomicrobia and Halobacteria, also do not have an exosome. This may explain other differences between the DnaG- and 16S rRNA-based subtrees of Euryarchaeota (compare Figure 2 to Supplementary Figure S1).",

We found that the conservation of the NTD of DnaG is very high and is comparable to that of the TOPRIM domain. The CTD is less conserved and the conservation is even lower in exosome-less archaea. Additional alignments were performed with 14 DnaG sequences from exosome-less archaea only (Supplementary Figure S2) and with 16 DnaG sequences from exosome-containing archaea only (Supplementary Figure S3). These alignments confirmed the highly conserved nature of the NTD and the TOPRIM domain, and the lower conservation of the CTD, especially in exosome-less archaea. Three invariant residues were found in the CTD of exosome-less archaea, but it should be taken into account that in this case only sequences from Euryarchaeota were compared (Supplementary Figure S2). These residues are also present in DnaG from the exosome-containing Euryarchaeota and the Crenarchaeon S. solfataricus shown in Figure 3. In the last 100 aa of the CTD of exosome-containing archaea belonging to all five archaeal phyla, an invariant aspartate residue (D329 in S. solfataricus) and a cluster of conserved residues (F360 to D367 in S. solfataricus) were detected. This cluster is present in all analyzed exosome-containing species but Nanoarchaeum equitans (Supplementary Figure S3). The data suggest that in exosome-containing archaea with exception of N. equitans, the CTD of DnaG is involved in the interaction with the exosome.",

Figure 4B shows that both truncated His6-tagged DnaG variants but not His6-Rrp41 were detected using the DnaG-specific serum.

Since DnaG from S. solfataricus binds poly(rA)30 (33), we assumed that the NTD may be involved in binding of RNA. This assumption was strengthened by the similarities between the NTD of archaeal DnaG and other proteins interacting with RNA found by Phyre2 (Supplementary Table S2, Figure 3). There are several invariant amino acid residues in the NTD of archaeal DnaG, among them are the Lys(K)6 and Tyr(Y)7 in DnaG from S. solfataricus (Figure 3). Tyr and Lys were reported to play key roles in binding of RNA in several RNA-binding proteins (46,47). Therefore we decided to generate a K6AY7A mutant of DnaG and to test its RNA binding activity by EMSA. The non-tagged, mutated protein was purified and analyzed by circular dichroism spectroscopy in comparison to the recombinant, wild-type DnaG, which carries a His6-tag at the C-terminus. No disorder of the secondary structure was detected (Figure 5A and B), allowing us to conclude that the mutated protein is suitable for our analyses.",

We also performed competition experiments with excess of poly(dA)30. Figure 5E shows that 25 pmol of unlabeled poly(dA)30 did not have any influence on the strong binding of the labeled RNA by wild-type DnaG, while 2.5 pmol of unlabeled poly(rA)30 abolished the binding of the labeled RNA.

Indeed, the Csl4-NT exosome degraded poly(rA)30 faster than the Csl4 exosome and even faster than the Csl4 exosome containing wild-type DnaG (Figure 6B and C). The faster RNA degradation by the Csl4-NT exosome was not due to RNase contamination of the Csl4-NT protein fraction used for reconstitution of the complex, since incubation of poly(rA)30 with the Csl4-NT only did not result in degradation (Supplementary Figure S5). Actually, contamination of the degradation assays by spurious RNases originating from E. coli were excluded in our assays performed at 60\u00b0C (30). Similar results were obtained from degradation assays with an A-rich transcript of 59 nt, which corresponds to a native RNA tail of S. solfataricius (Figure 6D).

Csl4 was detected in the elution fraction together with His6-Rrp41, His6-Rrp42 and DnaG-K6AY7A (Figure 7A, lane 11).

To test whether DnaG influences the interaction of the exosome with the 3\u2032 16S rRNA transcript, we performed degradation and polyadenylation tests using the Csl4 exosome with or without DnaG. Interestingly, DnaG enabled polyadenylation of this substrate by the exosome. Even after 15 min of incubation in the presence of rADP, the 3\u2032 16S rRNA substrate was not polyadenylated by the Csl4 exosome (lanes 1 to 3 in Figure 8A), while after 10 min of incubation with the DnaG-containing Csl4 exosome, the majority of the substrate was prolonged (lanes 4 to 6 in Figure 8A). In contrast DnaG did not enable degradation of the 3\u2032 16S rRNA transcript by the exosome (Supplementary Figure S6).",

Less substrate was polyadenylated by the DnaG-E175Q containing exosome (lanes 7 to 9 in Figure 8A) and the DnaG-K6AY7A containing exosome did not polyadenylate at all (lanes 10 to 12 in Figure 8A). This suggests that binding of the 3\u2032 16S rRNA transcript by DnaG is necessary for its polyadenylation by the exosome. To test directly whether DnaG binds this transcript, EMSA analyses were performed (Figure 8B). The transcript was completely shifted by the wild-type DnaG and the exosome containing wild-type DnaG, while no comparable shift was observed when the DnaG-K6AY7A protein was used, alone or in the context of the exosome. When DnaG-E175Q was used, the RNA shift was weaker than with the wild-type DnaG, resembling the results obtained with poly(rA)30 (compare Figures 5C\u20138B).",

In accordance with this, the native 5S rRNA was strongly shifted by DnaG alone or in combination with the Csl4 exosome in EMSA assays, while no shift was observed when the mutant protein DnaG\u2013K6AY7A was used, and a very weak shift was observed with the Csl4 exosome alone (Figure 8D). Furthermore, we verified that DnaG is also needed for the polyadenylation of in vitro transcribed 5S rRNA (Figure 8E). We noticed that although similar amounts of substrate and enzyme were used in the assays shown in Figure 8C and E, the in vitro transcript was polyadenylated with higher efficiency than the native 5S rRNA. In contrast to the wild-type DnaG, the double mutant DnaG-K6AY7A and the single mutants did not enable polyadenylation of the 5S rRNA transcript by the exosome (Supplementary Figure S4C).",

However, our analysis also shows that the presence or absence of exosome had an influence on the evolution of DnaG in Archaea. Previously archaeal DnaG sequences were used for phylogenetic analysis of methanogenic consortia leading to very similar results when compared to 16S rRNA-based analysis (49). Probably this was due to the phylogenetic homogeneity of the studied archaeal group, in which no differences in respect of the exosome content are expected. We found substantial differences in the subtree of Euryarchaeota comprising archaea with and without exosome. Thus, despite its high conservation, archaeal DnaG is not suitable as a phylogenetic marker.",

An involvement of the CTD in binding of DnaG to the exosome is also supported by the sequence comparisons shown in Figure 3, Supplementary Figures S2 and S3, since higher conservation of the CTD was found in exosome-containing than in exosome-less archaea. Not only DnaG-\u0394CT but also DnaG-\u0394NT is impaired in its interaction with the Csl4-exosome (compare Figures 4D\u20137A). Thus, the integrity of DnaG is important for a strong binding to the exosome. Most probably the conformation of the CTD is changed in the truncated DnaG-\u0394NT protein preventing efficient binding to the protein complex. Alternatively or in addition, each domain may contribute to the interaction with the exosome. It is known that the TOPRIM domain of the RecR protein from E. coli is responsible for the interaction with other protein partners and with DNA (50). The overall spatial structure of the archaeal DnaG-containing exosome is still not known. In exosome-less archaea the CTD of DnaG may contribute to the integrity of the protein and/or to the interaction with other proteins.",

            "text": "Our data clearly show that the NTD is a novel, conserved archaeal RNA-binding domain, which is essential for the interaction of S. solfataricus DnaG with RNA (Figure 5). The experiments with the chimeric Csl4-NT protein revealed that the NTD of DnaG is a separate RNA binding domain with poly(A)-preference, which can exert this function in the context of different proteins (Figure 6). We also show that the NTD is needed for strong binding of 5S rRNA and rRNA-derived transcripts (Figure 8B and D). Thus, despite its poly(A)-preference, this protein domain is a general RNA-binding domain necessary for interaction of archaeal DnaG with heteropolymeric substrates. Interestingly, we found that the TOPRIM domain is also involved in the interaction of DnaG with RNA. Notably, the conserved residue E175 in the TOPRIM domain, which is crucial for the primase activity of the protein (35), is important for strong RNA binding by DnaG (Figures 5 and 8). These results strongly suggest that the NTD and TOPRIM domains cooperate in binding of RNA substrates. Cooperation of multiple RNA binding domains, each with a weak affinity for RNA, is known to result in a strong RNA binding by other proteins involved in RNA metabolism like Lin28, a major regulator in mammalian cells, and the eukaryotic mRNA export factor Tip-associated protein; Tip is a tyrosine kinase-interacting protein (TAP) (51). The TOPRIM domain is characteristic for bacterial type primases, topoisomerases, OLD family nucleases and RecR proteins, altogether proteins involved in interactions with DNA (26). However, archaeal DnaG is not the only protein with a TOPRIM domain which binds RNA. A prominent example is ribonuclease (RNase) M5 from Bacillus subtilis, in which a TOPRIM domain contains the active site. Both the TOPRIM and the CTD of RNase M5 are important for binding of RNA (52).",

            "text": "Binding of RNA by DnaG is important for the observed faster degradation of poly(rA)30 (Figure 7) and is a prerequisite for the polyadenylation of rRNA and rRNA-derived transcripts by the DnaG-containing exosome in vitro (Figure 8). Therefore we propose that in archaea harboring exosome DnaG not only participates in the efficient interaction of A-rich RNA with the exosome (33), but is also responsible for the polynucleotidylation of rRNA. It is assumed that the heteropolymeric, A-rich RNA tails in exosome-containing archaea have destabilizing function (15,17) like the short poly(A) tails in enterobacteria and eukarya (18,19,53,54). Our data, showing that a heteropolymeric tail leads to faster degradation of rRNA transcripts by the exosome in vitro, are in agreement with this assumption. The destabilizing effect of the heteropolymeric tail was comparable to the effect of a poly(A) tail of the same length (Figure 9B). Similarly, both a heteropolymeric tail and a poly(A) tail equally enhanced the degradation of structured RNA by the bacterial degradosome in vitro (54). Analyses of the nucleotide composition of bacterial and archaeal heteropolymeric RNA tails suggested that the tails do not have potential to form strong secondary structures (32,55). Together, these data support the view that prokaryotic, heteropolymeric tails function as single stranded regions enabling fast initial interaction of RNA substrates with 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exoribonuceases. Although in vivo data demonstrating the destabilizing role of heteropolymeric tails in prokaryotes are still missing (55), we suggest that DnaG plays an important role in degradation of rRNA in exosome-containing archaea. This suggestion is based on the data shown in Figures 8 and 9. Degradation of rRNA in the course of the quality control during ribosome biogenesis or as adaptation to changing environmental conditions is of pivotal importance for the cell (18,20,56).",

This can be explained by the failure of some in vitro transcripts to adopt the native rRNA structure. Additionally, missing RNA modifications can lead to lower stability RNA structures (57) and this can lead to higher accessibility of the 3\u2032-end of the transcript for tailing by the exosome. Furthermore T7 polymerase adds a non-templated nucleotide at the 3\u2032-end of in\nvitro transcripts (58), which may facilitate addition of poly(A) by the DnaG containing exosome. We also observed that the 5S rRNA transcript is polyadenylated much faster by the DnaG/Csl4 exosome than the DnaG/Csl4/Rrp4 exosome (compare Figure 8E, lane 6, to Figure 8F, lane 3). Most probably this is due to the lower amount of DnaG in the Rrp4 containing exosome (Figure 1B)). In vivo exosomal complexes with different stoichiometric amounts of Rrp4 and DnaG/Csl4 are present (31). Probably archaeal exosomes of different compositions exhibit different functions, and it is possible that the exosomal complexes with higher relative amounts of DnaG are responsible for tailing of stable RNA.",

            "text": "Our results characterizing S. solfataricus DnaG as an RNA binding subunit of the archaeal exosome do not necessarily exclude a function of DnaG as a primase in the cell (35,36). It is possible that archaeal DnaG is a moonlighting protein like some other proteins with more than one function in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (59). However there are several reasons to believe that it is rather involved in RNA metabolism than in replication (60,61). The strong in vivo interaction with the exosome in several archaea was already mentioned in the introduction (8,12,13,31). In vitro this interaction leads to a clear and strong effect of DnaG on the polynucleotidylation of native rRNA and rRNA-derived transcripts by the exosome (Figure 8). In comparison, the documented interaction between S. solfataricus DnaG and the MCM helicase is weak (36). Importantly, this interaction does not influence the priming activity of DnaG and specifically inhibits the helicase activity of MCM (36). This is in contrast to the enhanced helicase activity of DnaB and the priming activity of DnaG upon interaction between bacterial DnaG and DnaB (62\u201364). Additionally, the Phyre2 analysis of the NTD and CTD domains of DnaG from the exosome-containing S. solfataricus and the exosome-less M. jannaschii revealed similarities between archaeal DnaG and bacterial and eukaryotic proteins involved in RNA metabolism (Supplementary Table S2), but no connection to the archaeal replication network was found. Together with the high, exosome-independent conservation of the NTD in archaea, the strong affinity of this NTD for RNA but not DNA, and the involvement of the TOPRIM domain in RNA binding, this implicates that DnaG functions as an RNA binding protein even in archaea lacking an exosome. In exosome-less archaea DnaG may play a role in the process of RNA degradation together with archaeal homologs of the bacterial RNases R and J, or of the eukaryotic cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (34,65\u201368). According to our data, DnaG is most probably involved in tailing and degradation of stable RNAs in exosome-containing archaea.",
