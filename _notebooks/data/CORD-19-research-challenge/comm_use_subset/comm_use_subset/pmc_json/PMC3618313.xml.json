This fatal bovine respiratory infection is a multi-factorial disease associated with a primary viral infection followed by a secondary bacterial infection. It is frequently characterized by concurrent infections of several pathogens. The etiologic agents related to feedlot pneumonias include bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 and 2 (BVDV-1 and BVDV-2), bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1), bovine parainfluenza-3 virus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine adenovirus, bovine coronavirus, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni and Mycoplasma spp. [3-6]. Resistance to respiratory disease in cattle requires host defense mechanisms that protect against viral and bacterial pathogens that have also evolved sophisticated strategies to evade the host immune responses, including among others an altered pulmonary macrophages (M\u03a6s) function or the induction of profound inflammatory responses that cause lung injury and sepsis [6].",

Briefly, twenty-four Friesian calves (8\u20139 months old), BVDV and BHV-1 antigen and antibody (Ab) free, were housed in the Animal Experimental Center of Cordoba University (Spain). The animals had an adjustment period of one week before the study started and were separated into three groups based on the inoculation protocol: twelve calves were inoculated intranasally with 10 mL of a suspension of non-cytopathic BVDV-1 strain 7443 with a titration of 105 tissue culture infective dose 50% (TCID50)/mL (courtesy of the Institute f\u00fcr Virologie, TIHO, Hannover, Germany). Twelve days later, when the calves showed neither clinical signs nor BVDV viraemia, they were challenged with 2 mL of BHV-1.1 strain Iowa containing 107 TCID50/mL (courtesy of the Hipra Laboratories, Girona, Spain) (BVDV/BHV-1 group). Two calves of this group, BHV-1.1-free, were used as BVDV infection controls. At the same time, ten calves were inoculated only with BHV-1.1 (BHV-1 group). Two un-infected (UI) animals were used as negative controls and received intranasally 2 mL of tissue culture fluid free of viruses. The time point of BHV-1.1 inoculation was defined as day 0.",

The changes indicative of this activation were an enlarged and deformed shape of the cells, a partial or total decrease in granule numbers and a dilation of the open canalicular system. The most common form of platelet aggregation was the appearance of mosaic-like clusters comprising fully degranulated platelets with fusion of cytoplasmic membranes. Occasionally, these membranes completely disappeared, giving rise to a finely granular structure with low electron density, containing vestiges of platelet organelles and surrounded by a membrane layer. In the BVDV/BHV-1 group, platelet aggregation occurred sooner and was more intense, increasing between 4 and 7 dpi (Figure 4A) and not showing a total recovery at the end of the study (Figure 4C). In the BHV-1 group this lesion was moderate, presenting retrieval signs from 7 dpi (Figure 4B, 4D).",

According to this, in the course of certain acute viral infections, platelets may be activated in vivo, leading to their degranulation, aggregation and withdrawal from circulation [47-49]. The procoagulant activity of BVDV and BHV-1 has been reported in vitro [50]. In our experimental study, it was increased in the co-infected calves due to the concomitance of both agents in the lungs between 2 and 7 dpi. Despite the absence of BVDV in the blood of these calves at the moment of BHV-1 inoculation, it does not completely disappear, being detected by PCR in the lungs and by IHC in lymphoid tissues throughout the experience [51]. However, there was no evidence in any stage of direct interaction between these viruses and platelets, which would suggest that platelet activation may be enhanced by indirect mechanisms including the expression of inflammatory mediators released by M\u03a6s, which are known to play a major role in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis [11,52].",

However, following BHV-1 inoculation, BVDV/BHV-1 group calves exhibited an early decline in iNOS (1 dpi), an inflammatory mediator that limits the extent and duration of pathogen-induced platelet activation [55]. This finding, together with the moderate response of TNF\u03b1, may have favored the appearance of platelet aggregates in the early stages of the disease, and intense aggregation coinciding with the greatest decrease in iNOS levels (4 dpi).",

However, in view of the damage observed at later stages, this action was presumably unable to counter the procoagulant events associated with the drop in iNOS expression, these being additionally enhanced by the delayed action of IL-1 in co-infected animals. Slowed blood flow, together with cytokine release, may lead to increased vascular permeability and extravasation of leukocytes into the pulmonary parenchyma [11,53,56,57].",

In this respect, further research is required into the possible involvement of this concomitance, through the use of live BVDV and BHV-1 vaccines, in the triggering of an impaired pulmonary immune response. On the contrary, animals pre-inoculated with BVDV - despite suffering a transient infection - exhibit an alteration in the response of pro-inflammatory cytokines which play a key role in activating the immune response.",
