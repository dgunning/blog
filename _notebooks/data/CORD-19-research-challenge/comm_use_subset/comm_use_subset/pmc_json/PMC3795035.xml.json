HeV causes lethal respiratory disease and encephalitis in horses and severe respiratory disease or late onset encephalitis in humans. In total, there have now been 39 HeV spillover events in Australia including 7 cases of human infection with 4 fatalities since 1994 [4]\u2013[9]. NiV subsequently emerged in peninsular Malaysia in 1998\u201399, causing a large outbreak of respiratory disease in pigs and encephalitis among pig farmers, and was later shown to be closely related to HeV [1]. Similar to HeV, nearly annual outbreaks of NiV infection have been observed. These NiV outbreaks have been associated with significantly higher case fatality rates in people, up to 100%, and several outbreaks have also been linked to the consumption of raw date palm sap contaminated with virus as well as human-to-human transmission [10]\u2013[12]. To date, there have been 570 reported cases of NiV infection in people with 305 fatalities [8], [13], [14]. The unusual broad species tropism, high morbidity and mortality rates, as well as the lack of any licensed therapeutics, have rendered the henipaviruses Biological Safety Level-4 (BSL-4) pathogens and potential biological threats to humans and livestock.",

            "text": "An often utilized approach to antivirus drug design is to block viral entry via small molecules, peptides and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind to the viral surface glycoproteins. A unique feature of the majority of paramyxoviruses is that they require two surface glycoproteins for host cell entry: a Class I fusion (F) glycoprotein and an attachment glycoprotein, which can be a hemagglutinin\u2013neuraminidase (HN), hemagglutinin (H), or as in the case for henipaviruses a G glycoprotein that has neither hemagglutinating nor neuraminidase activities [2]. The henipavirus G glycoprotein engages the host cell membrane protein receptors ephrin-B2 and -B3, and this initial interaction is believed to be sufficient to trigger the F-mediated fusion event between the viral envelope and the host cell membrane leading to virus entry [15], [16], [17]. In the absence of available vaccines or antiviral drugs, neutralizing hmAbs offer the possibility for effective pre- and/or post-exposure treatment for many important human viral infections. Previously, several hmAbs, m101\u2013m107, were isolated using a recombinant soluble Hendra virus G (HeV-G) glycoprotein as the antigen for panning of a large na\u00efve antibody library [18]. Among the hmAbs, m102 and its derivatives (m102.1-8) generated by heavy chain random mutations and light chain shuffling, showed improved binding to HeV-G; clone m102.4 had equal or higher binding affinity than the other clones and was selected for further characterization and converted to an IgG1 format [19]. The m102.4 hmAb was able to cross-react with both NiV-G and HeV-G in vitro with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50)of less than 40 ng/ml and 600 ng/ml for Nipah virus and Hendra virus, respectively, and is capable of neutralizing all available isolates of HeV and NiV [19], [20]. In animal disease models, m102.4 has been shown capable of protecting ferrets against a lethal NiV challenge [20], as well as African green monkeys (AGM) against a lethal HeV challenge [21], [22], in time frames of 10 to even 72 hours post viral exposure, respectively. In light of the experimental success of this post-exposure treatment of both NiV and HeV infection, m102.4 has since been administered on a compassionate use basis to two individuals in Australia with a high risk of HeV exposure during the 2010 HeV spillover, and again in 2012 in another person exposed to HeV. In 2013, m102.4 was used again by compassionate use protocol in an individual with a laboratory exposure to NiV in United States. In all these cases, none of these individuals showed symptoms of HeV or NiV infection at the time of m102.4 administration, and all individuals remain in good health to date. Altogether, as a fully human mAb, m102.4 shows promise as a potential prophylactic or therapeutic agent against henipavirus infection, and appears to be suitable for controlled safety trials in humans.",

There is one 1\u22361 complex per asymmetric unit in both crystal forms. The overall structures in the two crystal forms are very similar (Figure S1) and the region containing the HeV-G molecules and the complementarity determining region-3 of the heavy chain (CDR-H3) of the Fabs can be superimposed with an r.m.s.d of 0.3 \u00c5 for 386 C\u03b1 atoms, while the two Fab structures, excluding just CDR-H3, can be superimposed with an r.m.s.d of 0.6 \u00c5 for 185 C\u03b1 atoms. The difference in the two structures is in the angle between CDR-H3 and the rest of the Fab, which consequentially causes a slight difference in the buried m102.3/HeV-G interface area: 1070 \u00c52 in crystal form I222, and 1010 \u00c52 in crystal form P6122.

Interestingly, CDR-H3 of the Fab approaches the HeV-G central cavity in a similar angle and from the same direction as the G-H loop of ephrin-B2 (Figure 1B). The interface involves Fab residues mostly located on CDR-H3, as well as three CDR-H2 residues (L55, G56 and I57), one CDR-H1 residue (N31) and one CDR-L1 residue (R30) (Figure 1). The long protruding CDR-H3 (23 residues) adopts a \u03b2-hairpin conformation, including a stalk and a tip (Q105-Y112). The central hydrophobic HeV-G/Fab contacts are formed by embedding the tip of CDR-H3 into the hydrophobic HeV-G receptor-binding cavity. A simulated annealing omit electron density map of this region is illustrated in Figure S2. Among the eight residues on the tip of CDR-H3, L105 is surrounded by Q559, A532, N557, Y581, I580, I588 and E579 of HeV-G; P107 is surrounded by T530, A532, P488, T507, Q490 of HeV-G; P109 is surrounded by E505, W504, Y458 of HeV-G; S110 is surrounded by L305 and W504 of HeV-G; and Y122 is surrounded by T241, C240, T218, S239 and E579 of HeV-G (Figure 1A and 2C). In addition, the side chain of Q111, H108 and P109 of the Fab are stacked together, with Q111, which forms the top layer of the stack and hydrogen bonds to Q490 of HeV-G. The surrounding hydrophilic HeV-G/Fab contacts involve residues on CDR-H3, CDR-L1 and CDR-H2. Notably, R30 on CDR-L1 forms salt-bridges with E533 and D555 of HeV-G; Hydrogen bonds are also formed between N31 on CDR-H1 and E213 of HeV-G, as well as between R102, E103, Y112, Y113 and Y114 on CDR-H3 and Y581, S239, T218, Q490 and T241 of HeV-G, respectively (Figure 1A). All HeV-G residues engaged by m102.3 are listed in Figure S7. Interestingly, Fab binding does not induce any significant conformational changes in HeV-G and the r.m.s.d in C\u03b1 positions between unbound and Fab-bound HeV-G is 0.257 \u00c5. Some previously identified HeV-G mutations that were reported to affect the m102 or m102.4 binding [18], [19] are not part of the m102.3 epitope (Figure S3) suggesting that those mutations might affect the overall HeV-G structure.",

            "text": "The HeV-G head domain and Fab are both strictly monomeric, but, interestingly, when these two proteins are mixed together, they first form a hetero-dimeric complex that oligomerizes further in solution. Indeed the SEC assays indicate that 72 hours after mixing more than 90% of the complex migrates at a position corresponding to twice its original size in the gel-filtration column. An explanation of this phenomenon is provided by the crystal packing of the complex, where two copies of Fab and HeV-G assemble into a heterotetramer (Figure S4). It should be noted that the same 2\u22362 heterotetrameric Fab/HeV-G complex assembly is observed in both crystal forms. As illustrated in Figure S2, the heterotetrameric m102.3/HeV-G assembly is generated by a two-fold crystallographic symmetry axis in which the two Fab molecules contact each other burying approximately 770 \u00c52 surface area on each side, while the two HeV-G molecules remain separate. Importantly, there is an additional contact area between the Fab light chains elbow region and the HeV-G molecule of the interacting complex, in which a further \u223c240 \u00c52 are buried in each binding partner (Figure 2A, blue region). Thus, a total 1015 \u00c52 surface area is occluded on each side of the interface between the two 1\u22361 complexes. Within the 2\u22362 heterotetrameric complex, m102.3 and HeV-G form a more extensive interacting interface, rendering a more stable assembly. As shown in Figs. 2A and 2B, the total HeV-G surface region involved in the HeV-G/m102.3 interaction is almost the same as the one in the HeV-G/ephrin-B2, B3 interaction. However, the physiological relevance of this tetrameric assembly, and resulting cross-linking of mAb/G complexes on the viral membrane, needs to be studied further.",

CDR-H3 of m102.3 resembles the G-H loop of ephrin-B2 in both its shape and the insertion angle into the HeV-G cavity (Figure 1). Most of the G-H loop-contacting residues of HeV-G also participate in the CDR-H3 binding (Figure 2 C, D). Unlike ephrin, the binding of m102.3 does not cause any significant conformational changes in HeV-G. Interestingly, although the tips of the G-H loop and CDR-H3 both target the pockets in the HeV-G central cavity, each of them uses slightly different residues and anchoring strategies. As shown in Figure 2D, from left to right, F117, P119, L121 and W122 on the ephrin G-H loop insert into four hydrophobic HeV-G pockets, occupying half of the HeV-G cavity; while L105, P107 and P109 on the m102.3 CDR-H3 insert into the first three of these same pockets (Figure 2C). Among these, ephrin P119 and P107 of CDR-H3 are strikingly similar. Additionally, the insertion of CDR-H3 further embeds S110 and Y112 into the other half of the HeV-G cavity. The side chain of H108 of CDR-H3 extends in the same direction as W122 of the G-H loop but does not reach the fourth pocket. Instead, it is embedded in a groove defined by Q490, W504, and E505 of HeV-G. A hydrogen bond between Q111 of CDR-H3 and Q490 of HeV-G further locks the H108 in this position, preventing the withdrawal of CDR-H3 from the binding cavity. Since the S110 contacting resides on HeV-G are L305 and W504, mutation of S110 to A or V could presumably enhance the interaction between m102.3 and HeV-G. In summary, CDR-H3 binds to HeV-G utilizing a very high affinity lock-and-key mode without inducing conformational changes in HeV-G.",

Due to the high similarity between NiV-G and HeV-G, presumably m102.3 binds to NiV-G and HeV-G in a very similar manner, but an examination of the structure highlights some small structural differences that may explain the increased affinity of m102 for NiV-G. Upon superimposition of NiV-G to the m102.3-bound HeV-G, we found that only three residues at the mAb contacting regions are different. Among them, T507 and Y458 in HeV-G, which are part of the binding pockets for P107 and P109 of CDR-H3, are replaced by two hydrophobic residues, Valine and Phenylalanine, in NiV-G (Figure 3).

The primary sequences of m102.4 and m102.3 are overall highly similar, featuring an identical heavy chain (which provides all but one of the binding residues) and 15 different light chain amino acid that are not part of the m102.3/HeV-G interface (Figure S6) (but indirectly account for the small differences in binding affinities). As all HeV-G contacting residues in m102.3 are conserved in m102.4, the structural information obtained from the m102.3/HeV-G complex could also be applied to explain the mechanism of m102.4 neutralization. In the neutralization assay we performed, the efficiency of the m102.4 mAb to wild type NiV and HeV is three folds higher than that of the m102.3 Fab and m102.4 Fab, highlighting the importance of dimerization conferred by the Fc region. Notably, the efficiency of the m102.3 Fab is within the same range or slightly lower than that of the m102.4 Fab (Figure 4), suggesting that the neutralization efficiency may also be affected by the other factors, such as protein stability or flexibility.",

After 3 passages, the resulting virus stocks were plaque purified and tested for neutralization efficacy. The G and F glycoprotein genes from a minimum of five plaques of each escape variant were sequenced in order to identify mutations associated with the antibody escape phenotype. For the NiV escape mutant, all ten plaques of both the m102.3 and m102.4 escape mutants contained a single amino acid change at location V507I. HeV mutants that escaped m102.4 neutralization all contained a single amino acid mutation at location D582N (Figure S5). The m102.3 and m102.4 cloned virus stocks of these escape mutants of NiV and HeV, in contrast to wild-type NiV and HeV, were no longer neutralized by m102.4 at antibody concentrations exceeding 100 \u00b5g/ml (Figure 4). In addition, the cloned virus stocks of the escape mutants were then analyzed in single round growth assays in comparison to wild-type HeV and NiV on Vero E6, HeLa-USU-ephrin-B2 and HeLa-USU-ephrin-B3 cells (Figure 5). Both neutralization escape mutants grew as efficiently and to equal titers as the wild-type virus in Vero E6 cells. Noticeably however, during passaging, the m102.3 and m102.4 neutralization resistant viruses were relatively slow in developing cytopathic effects (CPE). Whole genome sequence was performed to identify any additional mutations in these two escapes, as compared to their parent strains (sequencing report is attached in Supporting Materials as Report S1). The HeV escape variant contains another silent mutation in the P gene, in addition to the D582N mutation in the G gene; while the NiV escape variant contains mutations in the N gene (3\u2032 end), M gene and L gene, in addition to the V507I mutation in the G gene. Thus, the escape is certainly due to the mutation in the G gene in case of the D582N HeV escape mutant.",

Interestingly, the affinity of the G proteins to both antibodies and ephrin-B2 was increased by the V507I mutation in NiV-G, and decreased by the D582N mutation in HeV-G. Residue V507I is located at the bottom of the NiV-G cavity, interacting with P119 of ephrin-B2, B3 and P107 of m102.3. The additional methyl group of I507 would likely result in a more intimate interaction with both the CDR-H3 and G-H loops resulting in a lower KD value due to a decreased dissociation (koff) rate. Furthermore, ephrinB2 binding benefits slightly more than both antibodies from the V507I substitution. Intriguingly, D582 is located on the B6S2-S3 loop of the G protein, which is outside of the receptor/mAb binding region, suggesting the D582N mutation affects the Fab/G-protein interaction through an indirect pathway (Figure S5). D582 forms salt-bridges with two residues on B6S3, R589 and K591. The D582N mutation would likely cause a conformational change in B6S3, causing re-arrangement of several m102.3-contacting residues including I580, Y581 and I588, thus hindering the insertion with both the CDR-H3 and G-H loops. Indeed, the observed association rates (kon, Table S2) of this mutant to both antibodies and ephrinB2 decreased similarly. However, such a conformational change would affect the overall ephrin binding less, and it seems a similar rearrangement takes place even in the wild-type G protein (Figure S5) [9], [23]. Indeed, I580, Y581 and I588 are the pocket-forming residues for F117 of ephrinB2 (Figure 2D). The elimination of the two salt-bridges resulting from the D582N substitution might even have a slight stabilizing effect on the G-H loop insertion. Accordingly, the observed dissociation rate (koff) for binding of the HeV-G mutant (D582N) to ephrin-B2 was slightly decreased, while the dissociation rates for binding the antibodies were increased. In summary, both mutations in the G protein favor ephrin-B2 binding as compared to mAb binding, consistent with their neutralization-escape phenotypes.",

            "text": "Targeting the viral surface spike proteins has been a powerful strategy in the development of neutralizing mAbs. Similar to m102 targeting the henipavirus G proteins, a number of potent antibodies have been developed against the spike (S) glycoprotein of the SARS-associated coronavirus, the hemagglutinin glycoprotein of influenza virus and the envelope glycoprotein of HIV. The epitopes recognized by these antibodies are often functionally associated with the viral entry mechanism (e.g. attachment and membrane fusion) to reduce the occurrence of escape mutants. For instance in HIV, the epitopes targeted by neutralizing antibodies are located in four regions: receptor binding site (RBS), fusion associated membrane-proximal external region (MPER) region, conserved glycan structures and glycan associated loop regions, while in influenza, the epitopes are located in the fusion associated stem region and sialic acid binding pocket region [24]\u2013[26]. In henipaviruses, as in all members of the paramyxovirus family, the attachment and fusion functions are exerted by two different proteins, which renders as possible epitope locations the RBS, the fusion-related regions, and sites associated with transducing the fusion-triggering signal from the attachment to the fusion proteins. In the past years, crystal structures of complexes between viral RBS and neutralizing antibodies have been determined, including m396 and 80R targeting the SARS S glycoprotein RBS [27], [28], CH65 and C05 targeting the influenza virus sialic acid binding pocket [24], [29], and b12, HJ16, VRC01, NIH45-46, 12A12, 3BNC117, VRC-PG04 and VRC-CH31 targeting the HIV-1 CD4-binding site (reviewed in [26]). Interestingly, in many of the examples above, the antibody CDR region mimics the conformation of the binding region of the cellular receptor (either protein or carbohydrate). Amongst them, most similar to our m102.3/HeV-G structure are the structures of CH65 and C05 targeting the influenza virus sialic acid binding site, which is a conserved shallow groove. All three mAbs use only CDRH3 to bind their target groove, but compared to CH65, C05 contacts a larger conserved region in the RBS, without interacting with the surrounding variable regions, which accounts for its greater neutralization breadth. The same strategy could be applied to further improve m102.3/4.",

Recently, the only post-exposure therapeutic option that is highly effective in animal models with clear potential for future approved human use applications has been the hmAb m102.4 [20], [21]. The reported success of m102.4 in a nonhuman primate model of HeV infection has been particularly encouraging, and the m102.4 exhibited an excellent distribution half-time (\u223c1 day) and elimination half-time (\u223c11 days) in the AGM. No evidence of HeV-specific pathology was observed in any of the m102.4-treated animals and no infectious HeV could be recovered. This study revealed that hmAb m102.4 prevented wide-spread HeV dissemination in virus challenged subjects, and was the first successful post-exposure in vivo therapy against HeV and the first in a nonhuman primate [21]. During the 2010 HeV spillover occurrence in Queensland, Australia, there were two individuals that were considered to be at high risk of HeV infection [35]. The m102.4 hmAb was requested by Australian health authorities and administered to the two individuals as a compassionate use therapeutic option even though no human safety testing has been carried out and it was not recommended for use in humans. In this instance, m102.4 was administered to the individuals prior to any HeV diagnosis or onset of clinical disease [35] with doses (\u223c19 mg/kg) sufficient to achieve a high serum concentration, and to date both individuals remain healthy and no evidence of HeV infection has been reported. The antibody appeared well tolerated when administered which was not unexpected since m102.4 is a human mAb. The m102.4 hmAb is now in further pre-clinical development stages in both the United States and Australia.",

The structure reported here of the HeV-G/m102.3 complex reveals the molecular mechanism underling the exceptional cross-reactivity and neutralizing potency of these antibodies. The binding of the hmAb to the G glycoprotein involves a single loop of its heavy chain with hydrophobic amino acid residues occupying the same pockets in G that the ephrin receptors engage during receptor binding. It is clear now that the central cavity on the henipavirus G glycoprotein receptor-binding face is vital for viral attachment and infection. From the crystal structure of the m102.3/G protein complex, we know that blocking access to this cavity is a feasible and efficient way of inhibiting henipavirus attachment and infection. Specific peptide or small-molecule inhibitors for the viral attachment glycoprotein can be designed based on the structural data. For example, the existing pockets in the G glycoprotein cavity can be used as targets in structure-based computational screens. Another approach would be to screen compound libraries using a protein interaction primary assay, and then optimize the initial hits to better fit the binding cavity.",

Of further importance, the new hmAb 102.3/G complex structure provides important information and leads for potential antibody improvement in two regards: increasing the antibody's affinity to the G glycoprotein in order to obtain even higher efficiency, and manipulating the interacting interface in order to reduce the potential of occurrence of escape mutants. The difficulty of the second aspect lies in the observation that the affinity of the attachment proteins to their receptors is not strictly correlated with the infection efficiency of henipaviruses. Thus, mutations that affect the henipavirus G glycoprotein binding affinities to ephrin receptors and mAbs to similar degrees could still allow potential escape. We indeed observed that even though there was a remarkable overlap between the m102.3 epitope and the receptor binding region of henipavirus G, two escape mutant variants of HeV and NiV, containing G glycoprotein mutations D582N and V507I respectively, were identified. In vitro manipulation, such as repeated passaging of virus and allowing replication in the presence of a neutralizing antibody is routinely used as an approach to generate escape variants that can then be examined as a means to map epitopes and detail mAb neutralization mechanisms. However, it should be emphasized that the appearance of m102.4 escape variants has not been observed in any of the in vivo efficacy testing against HeV or NiV to date, and this is likely explained by the fact that very high doses of mAb are utilized, similar to mAb dosing used in people in the prophylactic treatment of RSV infection with F (Synagis/Palivizumab) [39]. In addition, the effectiveness of m102.4 appears to be by virtue of its ability to slow the progression and dissemination of virus within the challenged host, allowing the host an effective window in which to mount its own innate and adaptive immune response that eventually prevents lethal disease outcome.",

The development of cytopathic effect (CPE) was monitored over 72 h and progeny viruses harvested. MAb treatment was repeated two additional times with CPE developing slowly with each passage. Passage 3 viruses were plaque purified in the presence of mAbs and neutralization resistant viruses were isolated. Experiments were performed in duplicate and the glycoprotein and fusion protein genes of individual plaques from each experiment were sequenced. The neutralization titers between wild type and the neutralization resistant virus were determined by micro neutralization assay. Briefly mAb m102.4 and Fabs m102.3 and m102.4 were serially diluted two-fold, and incubated with 100 TCID50 of the wild type (WT) and neutralization resistant NiV or HeV for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Virus and antibodies were then added to a 96-well plate with 2\u00d7104 Vero E6/well in 4 wells per antibody dilution. Wells were checked for CPE 3 days post infection and the 50% neutralization titer was determined as the mAb concentration at which at least 50% of wells showed no CPE.",
