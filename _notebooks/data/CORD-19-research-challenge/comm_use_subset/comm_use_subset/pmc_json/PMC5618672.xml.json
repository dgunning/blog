            "text": "Macrophages are central to the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 1, an autoimmune disease that affects approximately 1% of the world population 2. The abundance and activation of macrophages in the inflamed synovial membrane significantly correlates with the severity of RA 1, 3. Therapies that fail to reduce the number of synovial sublining macrophages are unlikely to be clinically effective 4. Major targets related to macrophage development, activation, growth and differentiation include tumour necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), interleukin\u20101 (IL\u20101), IL\u20106 and macrophage colony\u2010stimulating factor (M\u2010CSF or CSF\u20101) 5. M\u2010CSF\u2010dependent cells are known to be essential for collagen\u2010induced arthritis (CIA) development 6. Targeted delivery of antirheumatic drugs to macrophages is another highly desirable strategy for the treatment of RA because it would not only strike the cells that mediate or amplify most of the permanent tissue destruction but also spare other cells that do not affect joint damage 7, 8.",

Importantly, recent studies in TREM\u20101 knockout (KO) mice suggest that in contrast to cytokine blockers 12, therapeutic blockade of TREM\u20101 can blunt excessive inflammation while preserving the capacity for microbial control 13. Further, human beings lacking DAP\u201012, a signalling partner for TREM\u20101 (Fig. 1A), do not have problems resolving infections 14. Together, this implicates TREM\u20101 as a promising target for the development of new rational RA therapies.",

However, despite some recent evidence that peptidoglycan recognition protein 1 (PGLYRP1) may potentially act as a ligand for TREM\u20101 15, the actual nature of the TREM\u20101 ligand(s) and mechanisms of TREM\u20101 signalling are still not yet well understood, impeding the development of clinically relevant inhibitors of TREM\u20101. Recently, using a new model of transmembrane signalling, the signalling chain homooligomerization (SCHOOL) model 16, 17, we designed a TREM\u20101\u2010specific inhibitory nonapeptide GF9 that employs a novel, ligand\u2010independent mechanism of receptor inhibition (Fig. 1B) 18. We demonstrated that GF9 attenuates the specific inflammatory response and ameliorates sepsis and non\u2010small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in animal models 18. We also used self\u2010assembling lipopeptide complexes that mimic human high\u2010density lipoproteins (HDL) for targeted delivery of GF9 to macrophages (Fig. 1C) and showed that this increases its therapeutic efficacy in vivo\n18.",

We also investigated interactions of free and HDL\u2010bound GF9 with macrophages in vitro and showed that GF9 colocalizes with TREM\u20101 in the cell membrane and can reach its site of action from both outside and inside the cell. We next designed peptides GE31 and GA31 with sequences from GF9 and helices 4 and 6 of the major HDL protein, apolipoprotein (apo) A\u2010I, respectively. We suggested that by combining these sequences, GA31 and GE31 will be able to perform three functions: assist in the self\u2010assembly of HDL, target HDL to macrophages and silence the TREM\u20101 signalling pathway. We demonstrated, for the first time, that similar to GF9\u2010HDL, these lipopeptide complexes ameliorate CIA.

In this study, using fluorescence microscopy and GF9\u2010HDL with Rho B\u2010labelled lipid, we first demonstrated a punctuated pattern of the interaction between GF9\u2010HDL and macrophages (Fig. 2A), which closely mimics that of the physiological interaction between native HDL and hepatocytes, which is mediated by scavenger receptor BI (SR\u2010BI) 23. To confirm intracellular uptake versus nonspecific cell surface binding, we next examined the interaction between J774 macrophages and GF9\u2010HDL that contain Rho B\u2010labelled lipid and DyLight 488\u2010labelled oxidized apo A\u2010I peptide H4. This interaction resulted in intracellular delivery of both lipid and peptide components of GF9\u2010HDL (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the whole GF9\u2010HDL particle is uptaken by the cell, most likely by a receptor\u2010mediated mechanism. Pronounced colocalization of lipid and apo A\u2010I peptide H4 (Fig. 2B) demonstrates that at this time\u2010point, most of the GF9\u2010HDL particles remain intact after uptake, when the others are degraded, releasing their lipid and peptide contents into the intracellular space. While the data illustrated in Figure 2A and B were generated using GF9\u2010sHDL, similar results were observed for GF9\u2010dHDL (data not shown). Our data also indicate that the use of an equimolar mixture of oxidized peptides GA31 and GE31 enhances uptake of GA/E31\u2010HDL of discoidal and spherical shape by macrophages in vitro as compared with their unmodified counterparts (data not shown).

No differences were observed between arthritic mice treated with vehicle or control peptide GF9\u2010G (Fig. 4): the fore and hind paw joints had moderate to severe inflammation and cartilage damage with moderate pannus and bone resorption, as well as mild periosteal bone formation, in all joints. The ankle and knee joints from these mice had marked inflammation and moderate cartilage damage with pannus formation, bone resorption and periosteal bone formation (Fig. 4). Markedly thickened synovial membrane and capsule were observed in the vehicle\u2010 and GF9\u2010G\u2010treated mice as a result of pannus formation and inflammatory cell infiltration. The chronic inflammation destroyed the joint lining, including the cartilage and other nearby supporting structures, such as bone (Fig. 4). The formation of pannus probably resulted from overgrowth of the synoviocytes and the observed accumulation of inflammatory cells that led to deformed cartilage and bone. These findings agree with the observed clinical scores. In contrast, in the fore and hind paw joints of mice with CIA treated with free GF9 at 25 mg/kg, no or very minimal inflammation and minimal cartilage damage were observed (Fig. 4). The knee and ankle joints of these animals had no lesions or very minimal inflammation and only mild evidence of synovial membrane thickening with pannus formation, which falls within normal limits and is comparable to non\u2010arthritic naive mice (Fig. 4). Similar histopathology was observed in mice with CIA treated with either sHDL\u2010bound GF9 or sHDL\u2010bound GA/E31 (Fig. 4).",

Considering a high interindividual variability in cytokine levels in RA patients 34, this suggests that the therapeutic response to cytokine blockers as well as the risk for complications can depend on baseline cytokine levels. Indeed, in patients with RA, baseline TNF is associated with the clinical response to infliximab (TNF blocker): a higher dose is necessary in patients with a high baseline TNF, whereas lower doses of infliximab are sufficient for those with a low baseline TNF 35, 36. Further, for TNF blockers, an increased risk of malignancies is dose\u2010dependent 37.

As expected, in contrast to free GF9, which is inactive at 2.5 mg/kg, HDL\u2010bound GF9 at the same dose was therapeutically effective in treating mice with CIA (Figs. 3 and 4). Although the underlying molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon need to be further elucidated, one can suggest that this may result from targeted delivery of TREM\u20101 inhibitory GF9 sequence to macrophages and/or from the prolonged circulatory half\u2010life of HDL\u2010bound peptides. Confocal data (Fig. 2) suggest that in line with our previous data 18, 22, 25, methionine\u2010sulfoxidized apo A\u2010I epitopes involved in the interaction of HDL with macrophages are exposed in all types of these HDL particles and provide intracellular delivery of TREM\u20101 inhibitory GF9 sequences to macrophages, most probably in a receptor\u2010mediated manner. On the other hand, while the in vivo peptide half\u2010life is typically a few minutes 44, native dHDL and sHDL are characterized by much longer half\u2010lives up to 12\u201020 hours and 3\u20105 days, respectively 45, 46. This could result in less frequent administration, which in turn might improve compliance. Further, our confocal data in vitro (Fig. 2) and the therapeutic efficacy of HDL\u2010based formulations observed in vivo suggest that TREM\u20101 inhibitory GF9 sequences intracellularly delivered to macrophages can reach their site of action in the membrane from inside the cell. The use of HDL as a vehicle for systemic delivery of drugs is increasingly important 47. Together with advanced clinical development of reconstituted HDL per se as a drug 48, the capability of synthetic apo A\u2010I peptides to functionally replace human apo A\u2010I demonstrated in mice with CIA (this study) as well as in mice with sepsis, atherosclerosis and lung cancer 18, 19, 22 encourages further development of this HDL\u2010based delivery platform.",
