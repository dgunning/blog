Other Ebola diagnostic alternatives include the use of immunological methods based on polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) [8\u201311]. However, the production of full-length antibodies is a complex process from an engineering perspective, and the currently available production platforms are not sufficiently effective to provide the required rapid response in an emergency.",

To produce 1 g of a mAb fragment in a bacterial system would cost between 1/10 to 1/100 of the cost of producing 1 g of a full length mAb in a CHO cell system [13\u201315], the preferred production platform for mAbs. Furthermore, novel expression and purification technologies [16] have greatly simplified the purification of recombinant proteins produced by E. coli; this purification was traditionally considered a serious drawback of this widely-used expression system [17].",

A general decrease in binding affinity of antibody fragments, compared to binding of intact antibodies, has been documented [18,19]; however, the fragment molecules can be tailored by genetic engineering to improve their affinity and stability [20\u201322]. Many other design adjustments are possible for antibody fragments with respect to size, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, specificity, and even effector functions [12,23,24]. The use of antibody fragments to diagnose the presence of viral particles has been recommended and reported in the context of a number of viral diseases [25\u201327]. A properly optimized mAb fragment should be as effective as a full length mAb in terms of molecular affinity for an ex-vivo diagnostic application. Since a fragment molecule is much smaller than its corresponding mAb (approximately one sixth of the mAb mass), it can be argued that the use of an optimized mAb implies 6X higher binding efficacy per unit of mass.",

Briefly, mAb 13C6 is one of the three full-length mAbs contained in M\u2013003 (from Mapp Biopharmaceuticals), a formulation with proven protection against a lethal EBOV challenge in non-human primates [29,30,31]. Full-length mAb 13C6 is also a constituent in Zmapp, the mAb cocktail recently administered to human patients with apparent good results [32]. Mab 13C6 binds the glycan cap region of the glycoprotein (GP) [33]. MAb 13F6 is one of the constituents of ZMab, another anti-EBOV full-length mAb cocktail from Mapp Biopharmaceuticals [34,35]. It binds the mucin-like domain (MLD) in GP, a highly glycosylated region that is cleaved upon the internalization of viral particles into the host cells [33]. KZ52 is a full-length mAb originally isolated from an Ebola disease (EBD) survivor. The 3D structure of this mAb bound to trimeric GP was characterized in detail by Lee et al. [36] and Lee and Saphire [37].",

The LV and HV regions were connected by a glycine-serine linker. Each construct (Fig 1C) included a region encoding an N-terminus 6xHisTag to facilitate purification using a Ni+2-IMAC column (Fig 1C). In the case of Fab-KZ52, a small portion of the light constant region and the heavy constant region of mAb KZ52 were included in the corresponding construct (Table 1). Constructs were optimized for E. coli expression and synthetized by our colleagues at DNA 2.0 (San Francisco, CA); they were built into the plasmid pD444-SR and cloned into the BL21 C41(DE3)pLysS strain (for Fab-KZ52) and BL21 C43(DE3)pLysS strain (for scFv-13C6 and scFv-13F6).",

            "text": "Although fragment Fab-KZ52 did bind to GP, its affinity and selectivity were the lowest among the three fragments tested. A probable explanation for this could be the nature of the KZ52 epitope. While the conformational epitopes for 13C6 and 13F6 only include GP1 domain residues [33], KZ52 (and its analogous fragment Fab-KZ52) should interact with residues at GP1 and GP2 for proper binding. Any misalignment of the variable regions in the fragment could conceivably cause a decrease in binding efficacy [41]. In addition, the Fab-KZ52 epitope is less exposed than the scFv-13C6 or scFv-13F6. Since the access to the KZ52 epitope is sterically more impaired (not shown), the proper alignment of GP molecules could favor the access of antibody fragments to it. We tested this hypothesis by conducting binding experiments using a slightly modified ELISA format in which a layer of anti-histidine IgGs was dispensed at the surface of the assay wells for later addition of his-tagged rGP. While the direct attachment of rGP to the assay surface does not favor any particular alignment of the molecule, the layer of anti-histidine antibodies induces a preferred orientation for the His-tagged GP (Fig 4A) and HA-RBD molecules. Indeed, further improvement in the performance of ELISA Fab-KZ52 experiments was achieved by using an anti-histidine IgG layer (Fig 4C). The average Fab-KZ52 GP binding affinity (normalized by the negative control) increased 65.00%(\u00b129.94%), from 10.18(\u00b11.246) (Fig 3C) to 16.61(\u00b12.674) (Fig 4C). Interestingly, the average GP-binding affinity of the other two fragments (scFv-13C6 and scFv-13F6) decreased. On average, the apparent scFv-13F6 GP binding affinity decreased 30.20%(\u00b110.69%) (from 13.93(\u00b11.397) to 9.65(\u00b11.336) normalized units) and the apparent scFv-13C6 GP binding affinity decreased by 41.34%(\u00b16.54)% (from 19.08(\u00b11.750) to 11.12(\u00b10.938) normalized units) (see Figs 3C and 4C). Taken together, these results suggest that the effects of molecular orientation and alignment are relevant in the design of strategies for the diagnosis, capture, or blockage of EBOV. They also suggest that it may be useful to include more than one antibody fragment (actually a cocktail of them) to maximize binding.",

In these experiments, the binding between GP and the fragments was revealed using a solution of poly-clonal anti-histidine IgGs marked with horse radish peroxidase (grey Ys marked with a fluorescent star). (B) Negative controls consisted of surfaces with GP or HA-RGB not exposed to anti-GP fragments. (C) Plots of the absorbance signal, as measured in ELISA experiments, corresponding to assay wells where either GP (orange bars) was exposed to Fab-KZ52, (burgundy fragments), scFv-13F6 (green fragment) or scFv-13C6 (blue fragments). The absorbance signal has been normalized by the absorbance value of the negative controls (black bars). Symbols for mAb fragments are the same as those presented in Fig 1. Error bars indicate standard deviation from four repeats of independent ELISA experiments. Horizontal black lines indicate significant differences between groups (**p<0.01; ***p<0.001).",
