            "text": "Numerous neurotransmitter systems contribute to the normal development and function of the auditory sensory (cochlear) apparatus and the circuitry of the central nervous system. This includes members of the excitatory ligand-activated nicotinic acetylcholine receptor family (nAChR; Albuquerque et al. 2009). The nAChR subunit family consists of 16 distinct subunits that in various pentameric combinations form ligand-activated ion channels that each exhibit uniquely specialized pharmacological and functional properties (Albuquerque et al. 2009). One of these is the homomeric alpha7 nAChR (\u03b17) whose functional uniqueness is in part due to its expression by both neuronal and non-neuronal cells in many tissues throughout the body and because it is responsive to multiple agonists (including acetylcholine and choline as well as nicotine). This results in its ability to modulate a diverse range of cellular functions including cell growth, cell survival, neurotransmission, and inflammation (Gahring and Rogers 2005; Levin et al. 2006; Albuquerque et al. 2009).",

            "text": "Members of the nAChR family contribute to essentially all aspects of the auditory sensory system function and development (Morley and Happe 2000; Morley 2005). This includes widespread changes in expression during embryogenesis that optimizes their contribution to signal transduction, fine-tuning of sensory hair cells, and modulating central auditory circuit neurotransmission (Elgoyhen et al. 1994, 2001a; Happe and Morley 1998; Vetter et al. 1999, 2007; Morley and Happe 2000; Katz et al. 2004; Morley 2005). This functional diversity is in part accomplished through strict spatiotemporal control of different nAChR subunit expression, as has been extensively described for the nAChRs composed of either homomeric (\u03b19) or heteromeric (\u03b19 + \u03b110) subunits (Elgoyhen et al. 1994; Vetter et al. 1999, 2007; Elgoyhen et al., 2001b; Murthy et al. 2009). Less is known about the role of other nAChRs including \u03b17, although this receptor is implicated in modifying longer lived stimulation by high-frequency sound and supporting survival of spiral ganglion cells during development (Morley and Happe 2000; Morley 2005). Because the measurement of \u03b17 expression and function can be compromised by low receptor expression levels or the absence of conditions that best reveal its modulatory role (Gahring and Rogers 2005; Albuquerque et al. 2009), the participation by this receptor as an important contributor to the development and normal auditory sensory function remains to be fully explored.",

            "text": "In this study, we examine \u03b17 expression during development of the auditory sensory system. This was done using mice that were modified though methods of homologous recombination (Rogers and Gahring 2012; Rogers et al. 2012) to introduce, at the \u03b17 gene 3\u2032 end, a hemagglutinin (HA) protein tag to the \u03b17 receptor protein and a bicistronic IRES-driven tau + enhanced-GFP fusion protein reporter (\u03b17GFP). An advantage of the tauGFP reporter construct is that the tau component directs GFP into the axon of cells expressing \u03b17GFP. Also generated was a mouse in which Cre-recombinase replaces the tauGFP. The expression of \u03b17GFP in these mice reveals extensive spatial and temporal remodeling of receptor expression during embryonic and postnatal development of the cochlear sensory structures. Furthermore, \u03b17GFP expression continues in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells of the adult cochlear structure and the central ascending auditory pathway. This suggests that \u03b17 has the potential to impact functionally on auditory processes through multiple pathways and mechanisms that could impact upon the adult function in ways not traditionally attributed to this receptor.",

This generated the \u03b17GFP mouse (Fig. 1A), which expresses the tauGFP protein as a marker of Chrna7 transcription. The Speed Congenic Program of the Jackson Laboratory was used to achieve 98% C57BL/6 background congenicity (Rogers et al. 2012).

Detection of GFP offers superior sensitivity that is well over background fluorescence (Fig. 1B and C). For this study, some inconsistent signal detection or autoflourescence was occasionally observed and these sites identified in the individual figures.

This basic pattern of \u03b17GFP expression was reinforced during the remaining postnatal period as fibers continue to form a dense plexus that appears to surround the base of the IHCs. The other efferent fibers not detected by \u03b17GFP continue to be trimmed and also associate with their final targets (Merchan-Perez and Liberman 1996; Simmons et al. 1996; Hafidi 1998; Huang et al. 2007). The outcome of this remodeling was evident by P12 when the SG1 afferent terminals surrounding the IHC were distinguished by strong \u03b17GFP staining of the terminal clusters (Fig. 5I and inset). This was approximately the same time hearing onset occurs in mice (\u223cP10; Kros et al. 1998). Processes originating from SG cells identified by peripherin expression that were not colabeled with \u03b17GFP form distinct efferent terminals on or very near OHCs cells and on the terminals that end on the IHC afferent terminals identified by \u03b17GFP labeling (Fig. 5I; Huang et al. 2007). While not entirely evident from the images shown, not all SG cells at P12 expressed \u03b17GFP, suggesting this could identify a functionally distinct subpopulation (Fig. 5I; Happe and Morley 1998). Again, no \u03b17GFP labeling of olivocochlear efferents was detected. A diagram summarizing these findings is shown in Fig. 5J.",

Because cochlear morphogenesis includes signaling from rhombomere 5 (Liang et al. 2010), the possibility of \u03b17GFP contributing to the development of this structure was examined. This was done using embryos from \u03b17Cre mice crossed with mice harboring the conditional ROSA26-loxp (diphtheria-A toxin (DTA; termed \u03b17Cre:DTA; Rogers and Gahring 2012). In these embryos, \u03b17Cre:DTA-expressing cells and their direct lineages were ablated, thus revealing expression that could have been be missed by \u03b17GFP measurements (Rogers and Gahring 2012). An example of the cochlear structure at E16.5 taken from \u03b17Cre:DTA crosses is shown in Fig. 6. Because there is only occasional overlap with \u03b17GFP (see Fig. 5E), we used peripherin expression to aid in examining the fate of non-\u03b17-expressing cells (Fig. 6A and B). The overall patterning of the cochlear structure and the formation of major boney structures of the cochlea inclusive of the otic capsule and modiolus were intact, albeit somewhat distorted. The cochlear ducts were collapsed (Fig. 6B), probably due to the absence or severe thinning of the distal lateral wall. Also absent was the sensory cell domain containing presumptive OHCs and Deiters' cells (Fig. 6C and D), as expected from results of \u03b17GFP expression (Fig. 2., 5).",

These fibers also appear to be more densely aggregated relative to the \u03b17GFP control mouse (Fig. 6A and B). While peripherin-identified processes still project to the presumptive sensory cells (both IHC and OHC), they were less branched and those that did project to the former OHC target fields often turn and proceed backwards towards the vicinity of IHCs (Fig. 6C and D). These results are consistent with the earliest expression of \u03b17 being after major cochlear structures are determined, and there was the expected selective ablation of OHCs and Deiters's cells. The necessity of the presence of the target sensory cell to coordinate the innervation process is also suggested by these findings.",

Also consistent with those studies was that the cells identified by \u03b17GFP expression resemble octopus cells (Fig. 7B, insert). Essentially, no expression of \u03b17GFP was detected in the dorsal cochlear nucleus, although some dispersed and weakly stained cells were present in the granular aspect. Also evident was the strong staining of neuropil, presumably in part due to terminals of SG cells associated with the eighth cranial nerve (Fig. 7B, inset).

The novel finding that in addition to expression of \u03b17GFP in developing sensory cells of the cochlear structure and neuronal cells of the spiral ganglion, there is also considerable expression by nonsensory cells. Cells of the spiral prominence and ligament, Deiters' cells, and some Hensen's cells. Despite overall agreement between our studies and those using in situ hybridization (e.g., Happe and Morley 1998; Morley and Happe 2000), these nonsensory cells were not reported previously to express \u03b17. However, these comparisons are incomplete because the earlier studies did not necessarily show the comparable structures or the developmental stages at times where we observed peak \u03b17GFP expression. Also, our method of detecting GFP as a marker of \u03b17 expression offers improved sensitivity and resolution that has previously not been available for this nAChR.",

Comparing the expression of \u03b17GFP to the results from these studies of the sensory hair cells and the nonsensory cells of the cochlea indicate that there are significant spatiotemporal differences during development between the expression of \u03b17 versus \u03b19 and/or \u03b110. The \u03b19KO mouse also exhibits auditory deficiencies that are not observed in the \u03b17KO mouse, which is largely devoid of a phenotype in this sensory system under normal physiological conditions (Liberman and Brown 1986; Simmons and Morley 1998; Morley 2005; Lustig 2006). The \u03b17GFP is not detected in IHCs, which is consistent with \u03b19 nAChR being the principle target of alpha-bungarotoxin in this cell type (Uziel et al. 1981; Glowatzki and Fuchs 2000). Collectively, this suggests that functional redundancy between these receptor subtypes is unlikely (see also Rogers and Gahring 2012). This is also supported by the extensive studies by the Morley group (Happe and Morley 1998, 2004; Morley and Happe 2000; Simmons and Morley 2011) who showed that multiple receptor subtypes are expressed in the cochlear and central auditory systems, but each exhibits distinct spatiotemporal patterns that likely preclude substantial or sustained functional overlap.",

            "text": "Noteworthy is that the functional contribution of \u03b17 towards modulating physiological systems may not be revealed unless the system is imbalanced as by genetic deficiencies, sustained exposure to pharmacological compounds, or other events such as inflammation (e.g., Faustman et al. 1992; Gahring and Rogers 2005; Venables et al. 2007; Albuquerque et al. 2009; Brown 2011; Severance et al. 2011). For example, the dysfunction of \u03b17 is implicated in several psychiatric syndromes associated with certain forms of autism and schizophrenia (particularly in patients who hallucinate) whose spectrum of disorders include abnormal sensitivity to sensory stimuli including an abnormal auditory gating phenotype (Khalfa et al. 2001; Veuillet et al. 2001; Araki et al. 2002; McEvoy and Allen 2002; Freedman et al. 2003; Lippiello 2006; Martin and Freedman 2007; Wallace and Porter 2011 and references therein). Also, the association of certain auditory deficits and nicotine abuse, mostly associated with cigarette smoking, has further focused speculation on the role of \u03b17 in these pathologies and the possible advantages of therapeutically targeting this receptor for symptomatic relief in these cases (Araki et al. 2002; McEvoy and Allen 2002; Simosky et al. 2002; Freedman et al. 2003; Levin et al. 2006; Lippiello 2006; Martin and Freedman 2007; Wallace and Porter 2011). In this context, our results suggest additional lines of investigation. For example, in \u03b17Cre:DTA cell lineage ablation there are collapsed cochlear ducts and abnormal innervation indicating that the cells express \u03b17 and the cells that do so contribute an obligatory role in the successful development and long-term function of these structures. The \u03b17 receptor could also participate in auditory performance after birth, including functions related to the central auditory pathways. This study also adds the possibility of an effect by \u03b17 on the performance of the spiral ligament. These cells exhibit a cholinergic response that is most often described in terms of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (Khan et al. 2002; Maison et al. 2010), and their dysfunction is related to several pathogenic auditory deficiencies (Spicer and Schulte 1991; Slepecky et al. 1995; Kikuchi et al. 2000; Sun et al. 2012). The role of \u03b17 has, to our knowledge, not been examined in these cells. Collectively, the potential for \u03b17 functional pleiotropy in the auditory system is similar to other tissues we have recently examined (Rogers and Gahring 2012). Thus, multiple defects that impact upon adult function could be expected depending upon the timing, duration, and nature of the receptor dysfunction.",

Cells of the putative sensory region (sr) and the spiral prominence (SP) are identified.

Hensen's cells are noted (H). (I) The P12 innervation pattern is similar to the P0.
