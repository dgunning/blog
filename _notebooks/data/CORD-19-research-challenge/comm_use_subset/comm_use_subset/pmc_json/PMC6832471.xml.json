            "text": "Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is one of the major lower respiratory tract pathogens in infants with consistent annual outbreaks. 90% of infants are infected with HRSV at least once within the first two years of life [1,2]. Elderly patients [2] and patients with chronic heart and lung conditions such as asthma and immunocompromised patients are also at risk of severe infection and subsequent disease [3,4,5,6]. Co-infection with respiratory pathogens may exacerbate clinical symptoms [7]. According to the World Health Organization, there are approximately 60 million people infected with HRSV and 160,000 associated deaths every year [8]. HRSV exists as two distinct lineages known as subgroups A and B, which represent two lines of divergent evolution with both genetic and serologic differences. While both subgroup A and B viruses contribute to overall HRSV disease, some studies have suggested that subgroup A isolates may have slightly different clinical presentations [9] and effects on host cell signaling [10] compared to subgroup B viruses. In contrast, other studies have found no difference in the severity of illness caused by either subgroup [11]. However, a subgroup A clade virus was shown to be associated with more severe illness than other subgroup A clades [11].",

            "text": "HRSV belongs to the genus Pneumovirus of the family Paramyxoviridae and the order Mononegavirales [12,13]. The viral genome consists of a non-segmented \u223c15-kb RNA of negative polarity that encodes 11 proteins. As with all the members of the Mononegavirales, the genomic RNA of HRSV is always tightly bound by the viral nucleoprotein (N) and maintained as a helical N-RNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex [14]. The RNP is used a template for transcription and replication of viral mRNA and genomic RNA by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex, consisting of large polymerase protein (L) and its cofactor phosphoprotein (P). While N, P, and L are sufficient to mediate viral replication, transcription activity also requires the M2-1 protein, which functions as a polymerase processivity cofactor [15]. A feature of the Mononegavirales is that the RdRp is present in the virus particle to initiate viral mRNA transcription upon release of the RNP in the cytoplasm. The order of genes along the genome for HRSV from 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 is non-structural proteins 1 and 2 (NS1 and NS2), N, P, matrix (M), small hydrophobic (SH), glycoprotein (G), fusion (F), M2, and L. Synthesis of HRSV mRNAs has been proposed to follow a transcription gradient, with genes at the 3\u2032 end of the genome (e.g., NS1 and NS2) being transcribed more than genes at the 5\u2032 end of the genome (e.g., the L gene), which thus provides a control of viral protein abundance.",

            "text": "Macrophages and epithelial cells are involved in the innate immune response to HRSV. Many cytokines and chemokines including IL-8/ CXCL8, IP-10/CXCL10, MCP-1/CCL2, MIP-1, CCL3, MIP- 1b/CCL4, RANTES/CCL5, IL-6, TNF-, IL-1, and IFN are produced by these cell types in response to HRSV infection, and can be detected in enhanced amounts in respiratory secretions of children, hospitalized for HRSV infection [16]. During HRSV infection of cells, anti-viral signaling pathways are activated (e.g., references [17,18,19]), and this can depend on the genotype of the virus [10,20]. However, HRSV proteins can also modulate the host response to infection. NS1 and NS2 proteins inhibit IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) activation and this modulates type I IFN induced signaling and has other effects on host cell biology [21]. HRSV also down regulates the production and function of IFN [22] by inhibiting toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling and mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein [23]. Moreover, a reduced apoptosis and enhanced survival of the infected cells results from activation of the phosphoinositidide 3-kinase pathway by NS1 and NS2 [24]. Soluble factors are released into the supernatant of infected cells [25]. During HRSV infection there is an initial strong neutrophil response (with associated inflammation) followed by T-cell lymphopenia and a pulmonary CD8+ T-cell response [19]. A protective antibody response is associated with B-cell stimulating factors [19]. Immunity to reinfection is not complete and this may, in part, be due to the ability of the virus to interfere with antibody induced neutralization [26].",

Given that HRSV is predominantly a childhood infection, we wanted to explore the effect of the virus on this population. Ethically and practically it is difficult to take lung biopsies from this patient group, particularly from a control group who have no obvious signs of illness. Instead, diagnostic left over nasopharyngeal aspirates were used as a proxy for high resolution approaches to identify molecular changes in the respiratory tract as a result of virus infection. Two high resolution approaches were used: quantitative proteomics using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) on an Illumina 2500. These techniques provided information on both viral and cellular proteins and mRNAs and how these varied between HRSV-infected and uninfected children.",

This panel detects the 20 most common respiratory pathogens; adenovirus, coronavirus HKU1, coronavirus NL63, coronavirus OC43, human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus/Enterovirus, influenza A, influenza A H1, influenza A H1-2009, influenza A/H3, influenza B, parainfluenza virus 1, parainfluenza virus 2, parainfluenza virus 3, parainfluenza virus 4, HRSV, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. For this study the nasopharyngeal aspirates represented discarded NHS left-over samples and there was no identifying information. Nasopharyngeal aspirate samples from HRSV-negative children of similar age (<1\u20139 years-old, median age = 2, IQR = 2.25), obtained during the same HRSV season, were used as controls, and no pathogens were detected in this group using the Film Array. The nasopharyngeal aspirate sampling was carried out as per the hospital\u2019s guidelines. Briefly, a catheter was inserted into the nose, directed posteriorly and towards the opening of the external ear, in order to reach the posterior pharynx. Suction was applied and the catheter was slowly withdrawn using a rotating movement, remaining less than 10 s in the nasopharynx. The catheter was then rinsed with a small volume of sterile 0.9% saline solution to ensure adequate specimen volume. Samples were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until use.",

Proteomics has been proposed to be used for the potential identification of pathogens in complex samples [32]. However, as with nucleic acid-based approaches, such as sequencing, any search parameters must contain information (e.g., amino acid sequence) of the pathogen being searched for. Conventionally, nucleic acid-based detection systems were thought to be more sensitive than protein-based assays. To evaluate this, LC-MS/MS was used to identify HRSV proteins in the nasopharyngeal aspirate samples. Here, we would predict that viral proteins present in the virion would predominate over viral proteins present intra-cellularly, as nasopharyngeal aspirates should, in the main, represent secretions from the respiratory epithelia. In total five viral proteins were identified and quantified using two peptides or more (Figure 1; N (17 peptides), F (15 peptides), M (14 peptides), P (9 peptides), and M2-1 (5 peptides). In addition, three other viral proteins were identified by a single unique peptide (NS1 and L), but therefore could not be quantified. The peptide abundance profiles also correlated with viral load e.g., viral proteins were more abundant for the highest viral loads, and least abundant for the lowest viral load (See Supplemental Table S1 for ANOVA comparison). Two HRSV proteins were not detected; the NS2 and G proteins, even though that these proteins are encoded by transcripts that have higher predicted abundance than the F, M2-1 and L transcripts, and the G protein is present in virions. The major identified viral proteins are consistent with the presence of virus particles in the nasopharyngeal aspirates rather than proteins from intracellular material, where for example, the NS1 protein has been identified [17].",

The RNaseq data can be used to capture information on viral genome variation within a patient, this genome variation can be captured as minor variants and their frequencies [29,31,37]. Any variant that reaches the 50% threshold then becomes part of the consensus genome sequence. By assembling maps of minor variants, we were able to examine the nucleotide variation within the viral genomes obtained from the three clinical samples. For reference this genome variation was compared to an HRSV A2 strain grown in air liquid interface culture (in triplicate) and also using published datasets from our work examining the genome variability of HRSV in cell culture (Hep2 cells) [30]. The air liquid interface (ALI) culture system recapitulates major aspects of the respiratory epithelia [38,39], but in the absence of the adaptive response.

Overall the total frequency in minor variants observed in the viral genomes sequenced from the clinical samples was less than that from virus grown in either air liquid interface culture or from cell culture (Figure 4). Analysis indicated that the variation did not occur uniformly across the genome and was instead localized to in many cases to discrete clusters (Figure 5). We had previously observed this in virus grown in cell culture and part of the data from the previous study is included for comparison [30]. Interestingly the clusters of variation appeared to be non-random and grouped together for both the virus isolated from nasopharyngeal aspirates, air liquid interface culture, and cell culture (Figure 5). Reflecting the greater nucleotide variation in cell culture derived virus compared to virus derived from air liquid interface or the nasopharyngeal aspirates (Figure 4), there appeared to be greater frequency of variation at these clusters for the cell culture derived virus, compared to either the virus found in the ALI or nasopharyngeal aspirates from the clinic. This would indicate that the ALI may recapitulate viral replication/selection observed in vivo. These hotspots of transition and transversion substitutions appear across the genome and examples of occurrence are shown for the G, F, and L genes (Figure 5).",

By assembling minor variants and consensus genomes, we were able to examine both within and between patient variation in the nucleotide sequence (Figure 6). Here the data indicated differences in the minor variants between patients and between viral genomes within the same nasopharyngeal aspirate/patient.

HRSV encodes several proteins, including the NS1 and NS2 proteins that can associate with host cell proteins and modulate the innate response and other host pathways [21]. To investigate the host response in the clinical nasopharyngeal aspirate samples, mass spectrometry followed by Progenesis analysis was used to identify and quantify cellular proteins. This data was visualized in the form of a heat map. This clustered the changes in abundance of cellular proteins according to whether the samples came from uninfected or infected children. Further, samples from infected children were then classified into categories of viral load; \u2018low\u2019 infection (ct score >25), medium (ct score 20\u201325), and high (ct score <20). Therefore, the analysis indicated that the proteome of the nasopharyngeal aspirates was different between the different infected groups and the control group. This indicated that defined cellular proteins either increased or decreased in abundance in the nasopharyngeal aspirates from infected children compared to control (non-HRSV) children and this was also dependent on viral load. The proteins that were greater in abundance in the proteomes of the nasopharyngeal aspirates sampled from infected children compared to control children included examples of proteins encoded by interferon stimulated genes (e.g., ISG15, ICAM1, IFIT1, and OAS2). Of particular interest were the mucins (e.g., MUCB, MUC5A, and MUC2) and BPI proteins (BPIB6, BPIB1, BPIB3, and BPIB4). Members of these latter proteins have been implicated in the anti-viral response for influenza virus [42] and have been shown to be characteristic of inflammatory lung disease.",

Much of the disease associated with HRSV infection is proposed to be host mediated, where the highest viral load is often before the time of maximum illness [44]. Studying HRSV infection in the lung is complicated by the invasive sampling procedure required to access this organ, particularly in children, where informed consent cannot be directly obtained from the child. Instead proxy tools such as air liquid interface or sampling secretions from the lung provide the next best solution. In the latter case, either nasal swab or nasopharyngeal aspirates will provide indications in the form of cellular proteins that may be associated with infection [16]. The difference between a nasal swab and nasopharyngeal aspirate is that a nasal swab is obtained by inserting a tip of a bulb into the nostril and a nasopharyngeal aspirate requires a suction device and samples more deeply. In children with HRSV the nasopharyngeal aspirate was more useful in detecting HRSV than the nasal swab [45] and was used in the study herein to evaluate HRSV viral load and study the host response. This was achieved through a combination of high-resolution sequencing and proteomics.",

In this study LC-MS/MS identified peptides of HRSV proteins in nasopharyngeal aspirate from children (Figure 1) with confirmed HRSV infection using nucleic acid-based approaches. Only two HRSV proteins, NS2 and G, were not identified by LC-MS/MS, even though these would be predicted to be higher abundance than proteins encoded by downstream transcripts. Particularly for the G protein, this has been observed in previous studies, and may indicate that the G protein/peptides are hard to identify by LC-MS/MS or indicative of protein stability [17,48]. Nevertheless, in general, our data support the proposal that MS based approaches can be used to identify pathogens in biologically relevant material. For example, matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has been used to identify bacterial [47] and viral pathogens in clinical samples [46,49].",

The RNAseq analysis of minor variants in the HRSV genome indicated that these variants occurred at discrete clusters along the genome (Figure 5). Previous work has shown that ribavirin, a therapeutic treatment for HRSV, can induce hypermutation along the genome (30) leading to error catastrophe, and concomitant reduction in viral load. The RNAseq data indicated that whilst minor variants occurred in clusters along the genome, these were increased in frequency in a cell culture model of infection, compared to the more authentic air-liquid interface culture system and from the nasopharyngeal aspirates themselves (Figure 5). This may be due to a greater selection pressure in the ex vivo and in vivo systems compared to the cell culture grown virus. The clustering of these minor variants may have implications for providing \u2018noise\u2019 for selection to work upon and also may result in aberrant viral proteins present at a minor level. Nevertheless, this observation suggests that the use of continuous cell culture to study virus evolution may not be entirely the best model. Related to this, was the observation of a large degree of variability in the G gene of HRSV. The G protein is involved in receptor recognition and is one of the major antigenic determinants and for these reasons has been proposed to exhibit a high degree of antigenic diversity for the generation of antibody escape mutants [33]. Our data suggest this mechanism is operating within patients during infection.",

            "text": "The quantitative proteomic analysis also identified cellular proteins in the nasopharyngeal aspirates and the abundance of some of these proteins changed in abundance in samples taken from children infected with HRSV compared to HRSV-negative children (Figure 7). These increases in protein abundance, in some examples, was linked to viral load, unsurprisingly suggesting that the host response varies according to the amount of virus. Of interest was the identification of several proteins that increased in abundance in HRSV-infected children, belonging to mucins and BPI-containing proteins, the latter having anti-viral properties [42]. For example, depletion of BPIB3 has been shown to enhance coxsackievirus B (CVB) replication [50]. BPI l levels have also been associated with acute pneumonia in adults [51]. Proteomic analysis showed that several cellular proteins, such as HSP70 and HSP90, were associated with HRSV virus particles, suggesting functional relevance and potential therapeutic targets [52]. Indeed, inhibition of HSP70/HSP90 with small molecules had an adverse effect on HRSV biology [53]. Proteomics analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage from calves infected with bovine RSV suggested the activation of neutrophils and that anti-oxidant treatments should be considered to mitigate the physiological effects of infection [54].",
