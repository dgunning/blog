            "text": "Modelling the spatial disease dynamics has long been a research priority because of its potential in facilitating the development of mitigation strategies responding to the increasing threat of an influenza pandemic [1, 2]. The large-scale spatiotemporal spreading of diseases transmitted person to person via droplets or direct contact in real population is ultimately denominated by the population interaction which could be described by a social contact network and by interplay with the virus itself [3, 4]. Networks have provided a unified way to think about the daily interaction between individuals, are especially helpful when each individual is in direct contact with only a small proportion of the population [5\u20139], and thus have been powerful tools for understanding the transmission of infection in the population due to either social contact or sexual contact. Several types of classical networks have been frequently used in epidemiological literatures, which are random networks [10], lattices [11], small world networks [12], spatial networks [13] and scale-free networks [14]. Recently, researchers have incorporated demogeographic information into the contact network and integrated it with metapopulation model based on human mobility data [15\u201321] to pursue a better understanding of the role of real population structure and human mobility in the large-scale transmission of the diseases. The long-distance travel, which is the primary driving factor for the intersubpopulation pervasion of the contagion [20, 22], has been explored a lot. However, when evaluating the risk of infection for long-distance travellers, present studies have arbitrarily neglected the travel types and assumed all the infectious individuals in targeted population will lead to equivalent risk to the travellers, which results in an underestimation of the risk.",

In the spatially explicit simulation approach, in which the population is defined in terms of different groups, VFR traveller j will enter into a specific group C\n1 and thus will suffer from higher risk from infectives in this group than in the general community, which could be named \u201cmerging effects (MEs).\u201d The MEs will result in a different population structure as shown in Figure 1(c) in contrast to that shown in Figure 1(b).

The subpopulations are interconnected through two types of the long-distance travel based on whether the travellers are merging into the contact network of the destination subpopulation or not. We then examine the influences of the MEs on the spatiotemporal disease dynamics. The results show that the MEs have constantly accelerated and aggravated the propagating processes of the epidemics and higher merging intensity will strengthen these two effects. The sensitivity analyses for the travel rate show that a higher travel rate leads to more rapid disease transmission, while at the same time it alleviates the outbreaks. The impacts of the return rate are relatively uncertain due to its duplicity\u2014a higher return rate implies higher human mobility yet lower possibility of being infected.",

So the constructed social contact network could capture the regular contacts which could lead to the potential transmission of the diseases. Several network models could be candidate contact networks with each leading to different epidemic dynamics. Alternatively, we could incorporate more realistic data into the construction of the contact network with synthetic population generated from the demogeographic information and then organised into different types of groups which are believed to be significant to the transmission of the diseases, such as household group and workgroup [24]. The workplaces have been reported to obey a power law distribution for the number of employees in most countries [15, 25], so do the degree distributions of Portland's social networks [26]. Therefore in our model the individuals in each subpopulation are organised into a scale-free contact network [27, 28].",

The susceptible j from P\n2 travels to P\n1 and enters into group C\n1. We could review this process in an equivalent way. Suppose j travels to P\n1, whose contact network is given in Figure 2(a). If j is a business or VFR traveller, the MEs say that it will merge into the contact network of the destination subpopulation, for example, P\n1. The MEs take effects in the following two steps: first, j randomly selects a node v from the contact network of P\n1; then all nodes k \u2208 N(v) and v itself will be added to N(j). Since the contact network is undirected and reciprocal, j will also be in N(k) for k \u2208 N(v) \u22c3 {v} after this process. In the case of either node 1 or 2 is chosen by j, the resulting contact network will be the one in Figure 2(a). However, if j is a tourism traveller, it will be regarded as an isolated node in the contact network and only suffers from the risk of infection coming from random contacts in the general community. Notice that large groups tend to absorb more travellers in this definition because they have more group members. Let \u03c1 (0 < \u03c1 < 1) denote the merging intensity, with larger \u03c1 indicating that more travellers will merge into the contact network.",

An alternative method is to simulate an epidemic and look at the intrinsic growth rate of the infected population [31\u201334]. This growth rate r is defined as the rate at which the total number of infectives, I, grows in a susceptible population. The relationship between R\n0 and r could be derived by the expression of R\n0 in terms of the model parameters and the spectral radium of the Jacobian matrix of the dynamic equations, evaluated at S\n0 = 1. The SEIR dynamics are defined by the following four differential equations:\n(5)S\u02d9=\u2212\u03b2SI,E\u02d9=\u03b2SI\u2212\u03c3E,I\u02d9=\u03c3E\u2212\u03b3I,R\u02d9=\u03b3I.\nThe corresponding characteristic equation of the Jacobian matrix is\n(6)(r+\u03c3)(r+\u03b3)=\u03b2\u03c3.\nTherefore\n(7)R0=\u03b2\u03b3=(r+\u03c3)(r+\u03b3)\u03c3\u03b3.\nFigure 3(d) shows that in both cases (\u03c1 = 0 and \u03c1 = 0.6) the intrinsic growth rate r = 0.133. Thus we could get R\n0 = 1.60. The sensitivity analysis for \u03c1, \u03c4, and \u03c6 indicates that R\n0 is relatively constant, as shown in Figures 4(b), 5(b), and 6(b).",

The investigation on the infectives with respect to the time steps reaches a similar conclusion, which shows that the epidemics will peak much earlier and more dramatically; see Figure 3(b). Another notable outcome is the arising of multipeaks (see Figure 3(d)), which results from the variation in the arrival and peak time of the epidemics in different subpopulations.

Figure 4(a) shows the susceptibles in the two populations regarding the time steps with different \u03c1. The accelerating effect and aggravating effect will be strengthened with the increase of the merging intensity. The infectious curves in Figure 4(b) will peak earlier and higher with larger \u03c1, which leads to the same conclusion. To quantify the accelerating effect, here we introduce the concept of the \u201cfirst passage time (FPT).\u201d Define the \u03b1 (0 < \u03b1 < 1) first passage time of the percentage of individuals in class A as the first time step when the percentage of individuals in Class A is less than or equal to \u03b1, denoted by FPT100\u03b1%.  Figure 4(c) shows the variation of FPT50% of the susceptibles of the two populations with different \u03c1. The increase of \u03c1 has decreased the FPT50%, indicating a more rapid decrease in the susceptibles. The FPT100\u03b1% is a partial measurement which only involves the information from a single point. A more comprehensive measurement is the susceptible steps analogous to person years or person months which are widely used when performing certain types of prospective studies\u2014studies following a large group of people over time. The person years or person months measurement takes into account both the number of people in the study and the amount of time each person spends in the study. Define the susceptible steps (SSteps) as the aggregate normalised susceptibles over the concerned time period as follows (for the continuous scenario, we could simply change the summation into the integration):\n(8)SSteps(t0)=1T\u2212t0\u2211t=t0TSt,\nwhere T is the simulation period and S\nt denotes the susceptibles at time step t. Equation (8) indicates that the SSteps(t) are actually the areas surrounded by the axes, the susceptible curve, current time step t, and the simulation period T. Notice that the SSteps(t) defined above have measured both the accelerating effect and the aggravating effect. A more rapid drop of the susceptibles and a lower escape rate both will decrease the SSteps(t). The sensitivity analyses show that the SSteps at time t = 0 decrease with the increase of \u03c1 (see Figure 4(c)), which indicates that the presence of the MEs has greatly accelerated and aggravated the epidemics.",

First, the return rate has an effect on the individual mobility between the interconnected subpopulations. A higher return rate implies that more individuals will return back to their resident subpopulations and thus refers to a higher human mobility. On the other hand, a higher return rate means that the duration of the long-distance travel (with mean duration 1/\u03c6) will be much shorter and thus will decrease the probability of being infected and of infecting the others. So the aggregate influence of the return rate is uncertain, which is verified by Figure 6.",
