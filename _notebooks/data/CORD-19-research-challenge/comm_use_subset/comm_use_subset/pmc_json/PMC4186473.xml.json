Some studies question the value of bacterial sputum culture findings.8\u201310 Furthermore, serologic testing requires convalescent-phase samples, and therefore, it is not useful in the initial phase of determining the etiology. Blood cultures provide a microbiological diagnosis in 0\u201317%, and the addition of urinary antigen detection assays for S. pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila has improved the yield substantially.3,11 During the past years, PCR has been developed for many viral and bacterial pathogens, resulting again in higher diagnostic yields.12 Knowledge of the probable etiological agent(s) may inform treatment, thereby potentially reducing the use of antibiotics and eventually that of antimicrobial resistance.10",

            "text": "Respiratory viruses are poorly detected by conventional techniques.21 Rapid assessment of viruses is now possible with sensitive and highly specific real-time PCR assays, but the utility of swabs versus washes and nose versus oropharyngeal versus nasopharyngeal samples is subject to considerable debate. Lieberman et al.22 found that viral pathogens are better detected by nasopharyngeal washes as they offer a better yield than nasal or OPS, but this procedure is poorly tolerated and rarely used in hospitalized patients. On the other hand, de la Tabla et al.23 reported that a combined nose\u2013throat swab was superior to nasopharyngeal aspirates for the detection of InflA (H1N1) and that the combination of both methods increases the detection rate. In our study, we used a sputum sample and OPS for the detection of viral pathogens and found that OPS was equally or more sensitive for most viruses except HRV and RSV. Falsey et al.24 found in their study that more viruses were detected in sputum samples compared with nose\u2013throat swabs, 44% of the viruses were detected by both methods, 23% were positive by nose\u2013throat swabs alone, and 33% were positive only with sputum samples. Similar to our study, nose\u2013throat swabs and sputum testing yield complementary results. For bacterial pathogens, sputum samples clearly were superior to OPS. Similar to studies elsewhere, we found S. pneumoniae as the most common potential pathogen.1,25 In the literature, S. pneumoniae PCR on sputum samples as a diagnostic tool for pneumococcal CAP has had mixed results because distinguishing colonization from infection is difficult even by quantifying the load.26\u201329 However, patients with CAP tend to be more frequently colonized with pneumococci than asymptomatic patients and an important hypothesis is that aspiration of oropharyngeal contents the most common route is of developing pneumonia.30\u201332 Similarly, culturing Streptococci from sputum samples are not conclusive evidence for their etiological role. Therefore, the value of routine detection of S. pneumoniae remains a matter of debate. Similar to others, our study showed that molecular detection of L. pneumophila on sputum could replace urinary antigen testing.33,34 Practically, however, this requires a laboratory setup capable of providing such diagnostics with a rapid turnaround time, and 24/7, a situation that is currently not achievable in many settings.",

This was due to a Q fever outbreak in our area with over 4000 notified cases in the Netherlands between 2007 and 2010.35 For viruses, results comparing sample types were more variable: Overall, based on our data and the convenience of the sampling procedure, OPS would be the preferred sample type, with the exception of HRV and RSV. Our findings are in agreement with published studies focusing on viral pathogens as primary causes of CAP remain an issue of considerable debate.21,36,37 The majority of patients with CAP positive for HRV had a second respiratory virus or a bacterial pathogen, and HCoVs were never found as a single infection. In addition, HRV are highly prevalent, and case\u2013control studies have also found HRV to be common in asymptomatic persons as well.21,36 Our findings do suggest, however, that IF these pathogens are included in the diagnostic package and HRV testing should be integrated in a sputum panel, consisting of bacterial targets in addition to HRV and RSV. This may be more relevant for RSV for which therapeutic options are available, although the efficacy of antivirals in this patient category remains to be determined.38",

More than one pathogen was isolated in 34 (2\u00b76%) of the 115 patients and in nine patients three pathogens were found. Real-time PCR significantly improves the sensitivity of detecting pathogens, and often it is not possible to determine the contribution of each pathogen as the detection of viral or bacterial nucleic acids may not always represent causation. In a study by van Gageldonk et al.39, in approximately 20% of the subjects with no respiratory complaints, respiratory viral pathogens were detected. On the other hand, Lieberman et al.22 found a much lower prevalence (7\u00b71%) of respiratory viruses in subjects with no respiratory complaints. In this study, all subjects enrolled were symptomatic, and this would increase the likelihood that isolated pathogens were causative, unfortunately observational cohort studies such as this are not able to directly determine causation. Quantitative (RT)-qPCR data would have been useful to help address the question whether there is active infection in the lower respiratory tract instead of detecting residual DNA/RNA from a prior infection or asymptomatic carriage. Finally, we only included a subset of patients with CAP, but we have no reason to believe that the patients who were not included would be substantially different compared with the study group.",
