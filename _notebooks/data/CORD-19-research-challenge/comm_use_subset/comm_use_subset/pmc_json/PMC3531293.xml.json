One of the perhaps best documented examples are human influenza A viruses, which cause substantial morbidity and mortality as they escape host immunity predominantly through the evolution of their surface antigens [2]. The resulting, dynamical interaction between the ecological and evolutionary processess can be better understood through the formulation and simulation of so-called \u201cphylodynamic\u201d mathematical models, e.g. [3]\u2013[8]. However, while data on disease incidence as well as viral genetic and antigenic variation are increasing for many viruses, e.g. [9]\u2013[13], fitting and assessing phylodynamic models to these data is still not commonly done.",

For flu, this has limited the type of infectious disease models that can be statistically interfaced with time series data, and the number of epidemiological parameters that can be simultaneously estimated [18], [19]. Consequently, the disease behavior of rapidly evolving pathogens is increasingly studied under additional, complementary data sets [1], most typically in ways that attempt to qualitatively reproduce prominent disease attributes [3]\u2013[8].",

These methods have been particularly useful to reconstruct epidemiological transmission histories, identifying when and where transmission occurred and how viral populations change over time. For example, coalescent-based analyses have highlighted the importance of the tropics in the complex circulation dynamics of human influenza A (H3N2) virus (in short: H3N2) [9], [21], [22]. However, most coalescent methods estimate past population dynamics within a class of flexible demographic functions including exponential and logistic growth as well as the nonparametric Bayesian skyride [23], [24]; but see also [25]. These demographic functions do not explicitly describe the non-linear population dynamics of RNA viruses. Thus, assessing which ecological interactions underlie observed patterns of sequence diversity, and estimating the respective strength of these interactions, is difficult within this framework.",

This method circumvents explicit likelihood calculations by simulating instead from the stochastic model that defines the likelihood [26]. Recent extensions of ABC allow for model assessment to be carried out at no further computational cost [27]. We further suggest incorporating variable selection procedures to quantify if and to what extent the data provide support for the inclusion of specific model components [28].",

            "text": "To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we consider the phylodynamics of interpandemic H3N2. We obtained weekly reports of H3N2 incidence in the Netherlands from 1994\u20132009 by combining influenza-like-illness (ILI) surveillance data with detailed records of associated, laboratory-confirmed cases of flu by type and subtype [29], [30], and similarly for France and the USA; see Figure 1 and the supplementary online material (Text S1). In addition, we reconstructed the ladder-like phylogeny of H3N2's haemagglutinin gene (HA) from dated European sequences collected in 1968\u20132009 (see Figure 1 and Text S1). To represent H3N2's global phylodynamics, we focus on a class of spatially structured phylodynamic compartmental models that formalize probabilistically how evolving, antigenic variants interact epidemiologically. These antigenic variants might correspond to the major antigenic clusters that are distinguishable in H3N2 antigenic maps [31], but can in principle also represent a different phenotypic resolution. The evolutionary dynamics of viral genotypes are separately formulated for each antigenic phenotype because genetic distances do not necessarily easily translate into phenotypic relationships [5]. Spatial substructure has been incorporated in several models of H3N2 phylodynamics to reflect the global circulation of the virus [4], [8], [32]. We adopt here a simple source-sink framework, where the sink is thought of as the Netherlands into which viral genetic diversity and antigenic strains are imported on a seasonal scale from a source population where the virus persists [9], [33]. We fit and assess two distinct models to the combined features of sequence and incidence data described in Figure 1 and Table 1. The first model captures H3N2's antigenic drift phenomenologically through gradual loss of immunity, and the second model describes the antigenic evolution of the virus explicitly with particular assumptions on the tempo of antigenic change.",

Using a distance function  that compares summaries, each simulation  is weighted according to the magnitude of the summary error  under a weighting scheme , and this value is used in place of the likelihood term in Monte Carlo algorithms. In essence, ABC is a particular auxiliary variable Monte Carlo method, where the  summary errors take on the role of auxiliary variables. Integrating these errors out, the ABC likelihood approximation  adopted here is(2)where the weighting scheme is typically the Indicator(3)with tolerance parameter  or the Exponential(4)with . Intuitively, the summary errors indicate how well a parameterized model reproduces the observed data. Once Monte Carlo algorithms such as the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler proposed by Marjoram et al. [34] have converged, the magnitude of the summary errors can be used to diagnose goodness-of-fit with respect to each of the summaries . To use this detailed information on each summary, we prefer using (2) to the Mahanalobis approximation (see [26]). Although uncommon, we typically use the log ratio  so that the errors  can be uniformly interpreted as fold-deviations. Parameter inference using ABC is approximate in that the ABC target density  approaches the posterior density (1) as  tends to zero if the summaries are sufficient for \n[26]. We use a Monte Carlo algorithm that is very similar to the MCMC sampler in Figure 2. A full specification of the algorithm is given in Text S1.",

We typically use the Indicator weighting scheme (3) with tolerances  that encompass differences in summary values across reporting countries and/or reconstruction methods, see Table 1.

The first tier describes the dynamic interactions of antigenic variants in the host population, here in terms of coupled susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-susceptible (SEIRS) equations that are further spatially structured into a strongly seasonally forced sink population and a re-seeding, weakly seasonally forced source population (denoted by  and  respectively).

Generally, the sequence divergence imposes negative correlations between ,  (Figure 3E) and ,  (Figure 3F), and the posterior mean mutation rate /genome/year is much smaller than H3N2's substitution rate, 5.3\u20136.1/genome/year, when selection is incorporated into the model. Figure 4 illustrates that the fraction of susceptible individuals ranges within 15\u201340% and changes smoothly under seasonal forcing, thus leading to sustained oscillations in disease incidence. We failed to estimate , , ,  and recovered distributions close to the prior. Our prior assumptions are summarised in Table 2 and more fully discussed in Text S1.",

To match aspects of H3N2's HA phylogeny, unrealistically low pop-attack rates are further compensated by high .

Here, we chose broad enough tolerances  such that the weighting schemes are robust to differences in surveillance time series from the Netherlands, France and the US. This approach seems appropriate to avoid overfitting in the context of the limitations of syndromic influenza surveillance, but may be less suited in the analysis of other viral infectious diseases. Figures 3 and 5 illustrate that the resulting dimension reduction regularizes the underlying, intractable likelihood into a smooth, yet well-defined surface such that key phylodynamic model parameters are identifieable and goodness-of-fit can be characterized. It remains unclear to what degree the use of sufficient statistics or the full historical data would be desirable. Indeed, when infectious pathogens escape immunity, the likelihood surface can be especially complex [18], [43]. Likelihood-based inference is then sensitive to small changes in the complete historical data [46], [47], which can be problematic when the reported incidence time series or viral phylogeny is itself subject to considerable uncertainty and/or bias [2], [48].",

Here, the mechanistic structure of Eqns. (5) constrains the set of possible phylodynamic trajectories in such a way that influenza's global disease dynamics must be explicitly accounted for.

One possible explanation is that localized extinctions may not occur sufficiently often under the re-seeding source-sink framework, suggesting that models with more detailed population structure, either in space or by age, may result in thinner phylogenies. Accounting for these types of population structure can be critical for understanding viral phylodynamics; here we showed that the fit of the epochal evolution model to both sequence and incidence data depends critically on the assumed spatial model structure and the associated \u03c6 (see Text S1).",

Existing knowledge on model parameters is incorporated through the prior , and Monte Carlo algorithms such as MCMC are used to fit the model to different types of data, e.g. incidence time series and reconstructed phylogenies (see Figure 1) with an ABC approach. ABC is based on likelihood approximations such as (2), which requires a specification of phylodynamic summaries (e.g. Table 1). The summary errors are used to diagnose if the fitted phylodynamic model is consistent with available data in terms of the specified summaries.",
