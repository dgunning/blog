Furthermore, respiratory viral infections play an important role in morbidity and early immune development during the first year of life in otherwise healthy infants (12\u201316). Despite recent data on the association between viral infections and changes in the microbiota in adults, data for young children are scarce (17\u201322). Due to several risk factors triggering both viral and bacterial infections, it is difficult to draw causal associations between those early infections and later disease development. However, based on the long-term importance of effects early in life, the exact interaction of viral colonization and microbiota in infancy seems to be of great interest.",

Briefly, bacterial density increased and diversity decreased within the first year of life. If investigating the bacterial families, the relative abundance of Staphylococcaceae and Corynebacteriaceae was highest in the first 3 months of life. A virus was detected in 241 samples (43%); of those, 123 (51%) were accompanied by respiratory symptoms and 11 (5%) samples were taken during periods with more severe respiratory symptoms (lower respiratory tract infection [LRTI]). The most frequent virus was HRV (147 samples [26%]); all of the other viruses analyzed were detected in 39 (7%) samples or less; RSV was found only in 11 samples (2%) (for complete viral colonization, see Table 2). We thus grouped all other viruses as \u201cviruses other than HRV.\u201d After excluding the samples cocolonized with HRV, in 94 (17%) samples, \u201cviruses other than HRV\u201d were detected. Of those, 38 (40%) were accompanied by respiratory symptoms, and 56 (60%) were not. A total of 120 samples (21%) showed HRV colonization without cocolonization with other viruses.

In contrast, during asymptomatic HRV colonization, no changes in the microbiota were detected.

Especially HRV infections drive specific and nonspecific immune reactions and inflammation (31) through dendritic cells, macrophages, and epithelial cells and a number of cytokines (32\u201334). If future studies including sampling of local or systemic inflammatory processes (35, 36) can show that those mechanisms play an important role in viral colonization during infancy and in shaping the microbiota-immune balance, preventative measures, such as vaccination or application of probiotics, could be directed against those processes. Although further studies are clearly needed to confirm this hypothesis, the first studies have already shown a possibly preventive effect of probiotics on respiratory infection in general and HRV infection in particular (37, 38).",

In brief, V3 to V5 regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified using the primer pair 341F/907R. The following primers were used: 341F (5\u2032-CGTATCGCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAGXXXXXXXXXXACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3\u2032) and 907R (5\u2032-CTATGCGCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGXXXXXXXXXXCCGTCAATTCMTTTGAGTTT-3\u2032). The template-specific sequences are in boldface, adaptor sequences are italicized, and the XXXXXXXXXX sequences describe the sample-specific multiplex identifier (MID) tag barcode. PCR mixtures were eluted in 40 \u00b5l of double-distilled water, after purification with the Wizard SV PCR cleanup system (Promega, Madison, WI). PCR products with a concentration of less than 1.0 ng/\u00b5l were excluded from the study, corresponding to less than 1 pg/\u00b5l bacterial DNA (10), which was recently recommended as a reliable threshold (41). For further quality control, we excluded samples with less than 70 reads and sequenced two negative-control samples. Samples displaying greater than 5% sequence reads identical to the negative controls were excluded. In addition, we did not identify taxa that have recently been identified to be contaminations (42). A 40-ng/\u00b5l concentration of each PCR product was pooled, and every MID was used once. The 8 resulting amplicon pools were sequenced with the 454 sequencing platform, and the reads were submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive. Analysis of sequencing products was performed using PyroTagger pipeline (43), which comprises the definition of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on 97% sequencing identity, estimation of chimeras, and taxonomic assignments. Pipeline settings were described in detail before (40). As an additional quality cutoff, samples with less than 70 sequence reads were excluded from the study (n = 13), resulting in a minimum number of reads of 77. The mean number of sequence reads was, however, much higher (1,469 [SD, 1,083] reads per sample).",

In the second adjusted model, we adjusted for further risk factors of respiratory symptoms or viral infections in early life: having siblings, mode of delivery, child care, hypoallergenic nutrition, breastfeeding, parental education, smoking during pregnancy, and maternal atopy (44\u201348). To analyze the microbiota at the end of the study period, we calculated the median of the different microbiota outcome parameters of all existing samples of an infant between 9 and 12 months of age.",
