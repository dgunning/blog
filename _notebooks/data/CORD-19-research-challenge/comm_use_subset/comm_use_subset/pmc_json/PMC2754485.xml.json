In this study, we assessed PCT levels overtime and their relationship with bacterial infection in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients admitted to the ICU with severe pneumonia.

We used the pneumonia severity index (PSI) to estimate severity [13]. A systematic search for bacteria with standard methods and for viruses with sensitive methods (i.e., PCR and RT-PCR methods), as reported elsewhere [6,12,14-16] were performed. Briefly, sputum or tracheal aspirates were bacteriologically processed if less than 1% of the observed field contained squamous epithelial cells and more than 25 neutrophils were observed [17]. Pneumonia was considered bacteriologically confirmed when at least one of the following criteria were present: pathogen concentration greater than 105 cfu/mL in tracheobronchial aspirations or sputum samples; blood culture positive for a bacterial pathogen in the absence of an extrapulmonary focus [17-19]. In addition, a serological diagnostic for antibodies to Legionella pneumophila was performed by indirect immunofluorescence, associated with a detection of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 antigen in urine samples in all patients.",
