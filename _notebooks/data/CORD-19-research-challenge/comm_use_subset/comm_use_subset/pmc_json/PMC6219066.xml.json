            "text": "The long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are noncoding RNAs over 200 nt in length, are devoid of open reading frames (ORFs) and are mainly transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). lncRNAs are spliced and have a cap structure with a poly A tail, lncRNAs have lower expression levels of sequence conservation than protein-coding mRNAs [1]. lncRNAs come from the intergenic, intronic or coding gene regions in the sense and antisense directions. According to their genomic transcriptional positions, lncRNAs can be grouped into three classes: antisense, intronic, and intergenic. It has been reported that lncRNAs play important regulatory roles at the gene transcriptional [2], post-transcriptional [3], translational [4] and epigenetic [5, 6] levels, and are involved in variable cleavage, transcriptional interference, regulation of DNA methylation and protein modification. Interactions between lncRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs) are also widespread. Cai et al. (2007) identified an endogenously expressed 23-nt miRNA derived from lncRNA H19 in human keratinocytes and neonatal mice, and demonstrated that H19 could be used as a primary miRNA precursor [7]. Moreover, some lncRNAs have miRNA-binding sites and can function as endogenous target mimics (eTMs) of miRNAs [8]. In regard to embryogenesis, some lncRNAs identified in mice were found to not only be controlled by embryonic stem cell transcription factors but also regulated by the mice embryonic development status [9]. In plants, lncRNAs have been found to regulate growth and development [10], reproductive development [11] and stress responses [12]. However, while there have been a few reports on the regulation of lncRNAs in animal embryos, studies on lncRNAs in plant somatic embryogenesis (SE) have not been reported to date.",

            "text": "Longan (Dimocarpus longan Lour.) is an important fruit tree that originated in southern China and Vietnam, and has a wealth of pharmacological uses such as in antioxidants, hypoglycemic drugs and nervous system regulators [13] besides supplying fruit. Longan embryo development largely influences seed size, fruit set, fruit quality and yield. In-depth embryological studies of longan are of great significance for the longan industry [14]. A longan SE system established by Lai et al. [15] is considered an excellent model systems for woody plants SE. Recently, our laboratory has conducted systematic research on non-coding RNAs during early longan SE, mainly focusing on miRNAs. A total of 643 conserved and 29 novel miRNAs (including star strands) of 169 miRNA families were identified during longan SE [16]. The molecular mechanisms of miR167 [17], miR390 [18] and miR160 [19] in the regulation of the auxin response factors were demonstrated in longan SE. In addition, miR159 family members [20] and miR171 [21], which are involved in flower organ formation, were found to have the most stable expression among miRNAs at different developmental stages of longan SE [22]. In 2013, our laboratory constructed a cDNA library from a longan friable-embryogenic callus RNA sample and a large number of specific genes were identified [23]. All of these studies were focused on miRNAs and mRNAs in longan. Now, however, with the release of longan genome data from our laboratory [24], investigation of the regulatory roles of lncRNAs in longan SE has become possible. Therefore, based on the longan SE system and Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform, we isolated and identified lncRNAs from three samples of early longan SE, i.e., embryogenic callus (EC), incomplete embryogenic compact structures (ICpECs), and globular embryos (GEs). We explored the functions of the lncRNAs and their target genes in the three samples and speculated that lncRNAs might participate in the developmental process, and then predicted the regulation of lncRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs during early longan SE. Finally, qPCR assays and transient overexpression or inhibition of expression techniques were used to validate key lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs. The results enhance our understanding of the regulation of lncRNAs and provide valuable information for research on lncRNAs during early longan SE.",

As shown in Fig. 2c, the expression trends of the 3680 lncRNAs in the three samples were divided into nine major categories. The expression levels of 273 lncRNAs, which accounted for 7.42% of the total lncRNAs, from the first category were lower in the ICpEC stage than in the EC and GE stages. The lncRNAs in the fifth (386 lncRNAs) and seventh (361 lncRNAs) categories were expressed at higher levels in the ICpEC stage than in the other stages. The lncRNAs in the second and fourth categories showed stable expression from the EC to ICpEC stage. The second category included 369 lncRNAs (9.89% of the total) whose expression decreased in the GE stage. The fourth category contained 688 lncRNAs (18.70% of the total) whose expression increased in the GE stage. The third and sixth categories showed two completely opposite trends: the 477 lncRNAs (12.96% of the total) classified into the third category exhibited higher expression levels in the GE stage, whereas the 340 lncRNAs (9.24% of the total) classified into the sixth category showed higher expression levels in the EC stage.

The lncRNAs in the second, fourth, and eighth categories were accumulated from the EC to the GE stage, indicating that the related lncRNAs in these three categories contributed to the formation of the GE stage. The expression decrease from the EC to GE stage in the sixth and ninth categories indicated that the lncRNAs in these two categories were mainly involved in the maintenance of the EC stage. The lncRNAs in the second, fifth and seventh categories were highly expressed in the ICpEC stage, and these lncRNAs were possibly involved in ICpEC morphogenesis.

LTCONS-00022673, LTCONS-00057369, LTCONS-00031251 and LTCONS-00008111 showed a decrease in expression from the ICpEC to GE stage, which indicated that their expression levels decreased gradually during longan SE, while the expression levels of LTCONS-00030223, LTCONS-00006334, LTCONS-00045113 and LTCONS-00013909 did not change much from the ICpEC to GE stage.

Conversely, studies on lncRNAs in plants are still in their infancy, and most have focused on crops such as model plants [11, 39] and rice [40]. To date, there have been no reports on the involvement of lncRNAs in plant SE; thus, the present work is the first genome-wide identification and characterization of lncRNAs in plant SE. Here, 6005 novel lncRNAs were identified as associated with early longan SE, i.e. the EC, ICpEC and GE stages. Compared with lncRNA identification in other horticultural plants, e.g. cucumber [41] (fruit and root; 3274 lncRNAs), sunflower [42] (early flower bud; 25,327 lncRNAs), Brassica napus [43] (leaf; 9880 lncRNAs), the number of lncRNAs obtained from early longan SE was moderate, the poor conservation of lncRNAs among different species and the different tissues might be an important reason for the significant differences in the number of lncRNAs identified during early SE. In the three stages of early longan SE, 375 lncRNAs were specifically expressed in the GE stage, which was much more than in the EC stage (159) and the ICpEC stage (153). Among the three stages of the longan SE, the number of differentially expressed lncRNAs was highest in the EC vs. GE, and the number of differentially expressed lncRNAs in ICpEC vs. GE was 4.55 times that in EC vs. ICpEC. Thus, in longan SE, the establishment of embryo morphology and structure requires more lncRNA involvement, and achieving embryonic status (GE) requires significantly different molecular mechanisms to omnipotence maintenance (EC) and embryogenesis initiation (ICpEC).",

Therefore, differential enrichment analysis of the target genes (protein-coding genes) of lncRNAs during early longan SE provided valuable information. In this study, the plant-pathogen interaction, plant hormone signaling, sulfur metabolism and various kinds of amino acid metabolism pathways were revealed to be closely related to early longan SE.

These results indicate that similar molecular mechanisms are active between the pre-embryonic EC and the embryogenic ICpEC, and the main change leading to GE formation occurs in the ICpEC to GE stages. Thus, it can be seen that the molecular mechanisms of embryo formation can change dramatically.",

            "text": "Previous studies reported that the plant-pathogen interaction pathway was enriched in lncRNAs [46], miRNAs [47, 48] and gene transcripts [23], which suggested the importance of plant-pathogen interactions in the embryonic developmental network in longan and other plants. Plant hormones play important roles in plant growth and SE in plants [49]. In a study of SE of Hevea seeds, it was found that an excess of auxin and cytokinin inhibited the embryogenic ability of callus [50]. Zhu et al. studied the effects of plant hormones on SE and plant regeneration in cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) [51]. The phytohormone signal transduction pathway includes auxin, kinetin, gibberellin and abscisic acid, among which auxin is an important factor in plant SE, e.g. it regulates embryonic development by regulating ARF-mediated transcription [36, 37], and Aux/IAAs also participate in the regulation of auxin by inhibiting ARF-mediated transcription [52]. Our laboratory has studied related genes including TIF1 [53], DlARF8 [17], ARF3/4 [18] and ARF10, \u2212 16, and \u2212 17 [19] that regulate the auxin response. In the KEGG enrichment results, it seemed that longan had begun to establish disease resistance mechanisms and other metabolic components based on hormones in the GE stage. This change not only involved a large number of mRNAs, but also a large number of lncRNAs that participate in the molecular regulation and morphogenesis of the GE stage by regulating target genes (mRNA).",

A common method of trans-regulation is the upregulation of target gene expression by forming dimers with neighboring mRNAs that increase mRNA stability [56, 57]. In this study, the locations of 14 pairs of lncRNAs and their target mRNAs were verified by qPCR analysis. Ten pairs of cis-regulated mRNAs and lncRNAs were identified, including seven pairs that had positively regulated and three pairs that had negatively regulated genes. Four pairs of trans-regulated mRNAs and lncRNAs were found in longan SE, including three pairs with positive regulatory relationships and one pair with a negative regulatory relationship. The target genes of the five lncRNAs associated with auxin response factors were cis-regulated, which implied that the lncRNAs associated with auxin response factors mainly function as cis-acting regulators during early longan SE.",

Five lncRNAs related to the auxin response factors selected for miRNA target prediction, and seven miRNAs (lncRNAs as miRNA target genes) were predicted to be involved in the action of lncRNAs. Notably, both lncRNAs and t protein-coding genes could act on the same miRNA at the same time.

The number of lncRNAs specifically expressed in the GE stage was much greater than that in the EC stage and the ICpEC stage. We speculate that the GE stage requires more lncRNAs to regulate. The most highly enriched KEGG pathways were plant-pathogen interactions and phytohormone signaling. qPCR verification of five ARF-related lncRNAs and their target genes (mRNA) suggested that lncRNAs tend to positively regulate target genes in the early stages of longan SE. In lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA relationship predictions, some lncRNAs were predicted to function as eTMs for miRNAs and some were identified as potential miRNA precursors. In addition, we verified the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships by transient expression, and speculate that they comprise a regulatory network. Our results contribute to the understanding of lncRNA regulation in plant SE.",
