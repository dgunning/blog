The rate of synonymous nucleotide per non\u2010synonymous site (dN) against that of nucleotide substitution per synonymous site (dS), which is the dN/dS ratio, was used as an index to assess selection pressure and was interpreted as follows: dN/dS >1 = positive (diversifying) selection, whereas dN/dS <1 = negative selection (purifying) and dN/dS = 1 means neutral selection. The level of significance for selection was based on the P\u2010value. Strong evidence of selection was indicated by a P\u2010value < 0\u00b705.",

In this study, we sought to address this gap and found that in 2008, all the three species of HRVs were detected in patients who presented with ILI symptoms in hospitals across Kenya. Whereas symptoms data for all patients were available, no clinical diagnosis data were provided by the attending clinicians and therefore it was not possible to associate HRV infection with disease severity. However, detection of HRV in symptomatic patients enrolled in this study suggests that in Kenya, HRVs contribute to diseases that manifest as ILI. Indeed, some studies have reported more frequent HRV detection in symptomatic than asymptomatic cases.19, 20\n",
