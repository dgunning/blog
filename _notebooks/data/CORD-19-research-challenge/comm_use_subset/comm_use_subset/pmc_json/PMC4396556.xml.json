While major advances have been made in design of chemotherapy agents, radiation, and surgical procedures, mortality rates remain high. Terminal cancer requires innovative therapeutic approaches, which are currently limited. Traditional use of herbs to treat diverse human illnesses dates back to thousands of years, but in today's society the use of natural product remedies is defined amongst others under the classification of \u201ccomplementary and alternative medicines\u201d (CAMs) [1\u20133]. The field of CAM is of global interest, in particular to augment traditional chemotherapies, prevent cancer remission, or serve as basic chemopreventive strategies [4\u20137].",

Rhus chinensis gall (RCG) is the abnormal growth of Rhus chinensis leaves caused by Chinese aphid Schlechtendalia chinensis [8, 9], also used for decades by indigenous people in the treatment of diarrhea, hemorrhage, and inflammation [10\u201317]. In a recent study conducted in our laboratory, a high-throughput screening of natural products revealed the extract of RGC to halt the proliferation of human breast cancer cells [7] and inhibit hLDH-A [18], an enzyme which plays a significant role in driving aggressive malignancies [2, 19\u201321], chemo- and radiotherapy resistance [22, 23], tumorigenic potential [24\u201326], and metastatic processes [22]. It is believed that the abundance of lactic acid produced and released by tumor cells assists in invasion and motility [27] where a low pH weakens the extracellular stroma which helps tumor cells to dislodge and burrow in the blood and lymphatic systems [28].",

Tumor cell overproduction of lactic acid (in the absence or presence of O2) was described almost a century ago by Otto Warburg, having been termed \u201cthe Warburg effect.\u201d While many scientists theorize that this aberration is a function of altered metabolism, studies in our laboratory exploring this phenomenon using current technologies such as whole-genomic, proteomic MALDI-TOF-MS and metabolite analysis show that the Warburg effect has a functional role not in metabolism, but in regulating acidic pericellular pH (pHe). For some unknown reason, cancer cells inherently thrive in slightly acidic pH, are extremely vulnerable to necrosis as the pH shifts toward alkaline, and will sustain a steady state pH through metabolic inversion or fluctuating dominance between glycolytic-rate substrate level phosphorylation (SLP) and mitochondrial (mt) oxidative phosphorylation to control lactic acid production [50]. If this is the case, then hLDH-A would comprise a vehicle to maintain acidic pH where tumor cells thrive, but the question after much work still remains as to why tumor cells require ample concentrations of acid.",
