We performed a similar screen with HuH-7 cell lysates to identify proteins that bind to the DENV-2 UTRs in a commonly used cell culture model for Flavivirus replication. We defined DENV-2 UTR-interacting proteins as those enriched \u22652-fold over the control RNA in three independent experiments with at least \u22652 ratio counts. Thirty-seven (37) proteins met these criteria (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S1 \u201cPos strand RBPs\u201d). Of these, twenty-one (21) proteins had been identified in our previous screen as candidate DENV-2 UTR-interacting proteins in HeLa cells10; among these 21 was the putative DEDD RNA exonuclease ERI3 (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Table S1 \u201cNew screen v Ward et al.10\u201d). ERI3 was enriched for binding to the UTR RNA 2.6-fold, on average (SD = 0.255) (Supplementary Table S1). Indeed, ERI3 was independently identified as a candidate \u2018hit\u2019 in an RNAi screen for DENV-2 host factors in HuH-7 cells (Barrows et al., manuscript in preparation), suggesting that the binding we observed was functionally significant.",

We generated HEK293 cells expressing N-terminal FLAG-tagged ERI3 under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter. Expression of FLAG-ERI3 was induced and, 24 hours later, cells were infected with DENV-2 (MOI = 1.0), YFV17D (MOI = 1.0), EV71 (MOI = 0.3) or MuV (MOI = 1.0). 24 hours post-infection, lysates were harvested and immunoprecipitated using a mouse FLAG antibody or a mouse IgG control.

To determine if FLAG-ERI3 immunoprecipitation preferentially enriched for gRNA or subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA), we performed qPCR using primers specific for sequence within the 3\u2032 UTR and calculated the sfRNA concentration18. In contrast to gRNA alone, FLAG-ERI3 immunoprecipitation did not significantly enrich sfRNA (21.9-fold enrichment for gRNA, P = 0.02 vs. 0.45-fold enrichment for sfRNA, P = 0.09) (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S1A), suggesting that ERI3 preferentially binds to DENV-2 gRNA.

Knockdown of the vATPase subunit or ERI3 led to a 3- to 10-fold reduction in DENV-2 gRNA accumulation compared to the control knockdown (One-way ANOVA, P < 0.0001, Dunnett\u2019s post-test P < 0.05) (Fig. 3B). Since the qPCR primers target the NS2A region of the viral genome and gRNA is incompletely degraded to generate sfRNA, we wanted to determine if gRNA was being degraded to sfRNA in the absence of ERI3. We performed qPCR using gRNA-specific primers and a set of primers that targets the 3\u2032 UTR, which detects both gRNA and sfRNA. In vitro transcribed DENV-2 replicon RNA, containing both target sequences, was used to generate cDNA, perform qPCR and plot a standard curve for absolute quantitation of gRNA and sfRNA levels, as described in Bidet et al.18. Knockdown of the vATPase subunit led to a 10-fold reduction of the sfRNA:gRNA ratio compared to the control knockdown (One-way ANOVA, P < 0.021, Dunnett\u2019s post-test, P < 0.05) (Supplementary Fig. S2D). DENV-2 replication is restricted early following knockdown of the vATPase subunit and RT-qPCR would primarily detect incoming viral genomes, leading to a reduction in the sfRNA:gRNA ratio (Fig. 3B; Supplementary Fig. S2D)21. Similarly, knockdown of ERI3 led to a 5- to 10-fold reduction of the sfRNA:gRNA ratio compared to the control knockdown (One-way ANOVA, P < 0.021, Dunnett\u2019s post-test, P < 0.05) (Supplementary Fig. S2D). These results suggest that ERI3 is required for accumulation of both gRNA and sfRNA, and, therefore, an early process in replication is defective in the absence of ERI3.",

As seen in Fig. 6, ERI3 and TGON2 localized to condensed cytoplasmic structures, consistent with the Golgi in uninfected cells (Fig. 6A). At 18 hours post-infection, ERI3 primarily localized to similar condensed Golgi structures as TGON2, distinct from areas marked by anti-dsRNA (Fig. 6A). At 20 and 24 hours post-infection, however, the condensed Golgi structure appeared to expand or break down and both ERI3 and TGON2 relocated to within close proximity of dsRNA (Fig. 6A). To confirm that TGON2 was relocalizing to ER-derived replication sites, we probed with antibodies to TGON2, dsRNA and the ER marker CANX. At 24 hours post-infection, TGON2 and CANX localized near to dsRNA, confirming that TGON2 is relocalizing to similar sites as CANX (Fig. 6A). These data demonstrate that ERI3, along with Golgi-associated membranes, are found near sites of DENV-2 replication during infection. The localization of ERI3 in infected cells and its role in RNA synthesis probably explains why we do not detect significant interactions with the DENV-2 sfRNA.",

In order to further resolve the structures formed by ERI3, dsRNA and ER (CANX) or Golgi markers (TGON2) at replication sites, we performed additional imaging by three-dimensional super resolution microscopy. At 24 hours post-infection, samples were prepared as described previously and imaged using the Zeiss LSM880 confocal, equipped with an Airyscan detector capable of 140 nm resolution. DENV-2 infected cells were identified by positive staining for dsRNA and, consistent with the previous results (Fig. 6A), ERI3 relocalized to the vicinity of replication sites as punctate aggregates (Fig. 6B). CANX, a previously described marker for replication sites6, localized to the ER and nuclear envelope and near to viral replication sites. Volumetric rendering of these sites elucidated microdomains containing small membranous sheets of CANX along with dsRNA and ERI3 (Fig. 6B). We performed a similar analysis using samples stained for dsRNA, ERI3 and TGON2. TGON2 relocalized from the Golgi and formed interconnected membranous structures surrounding the ERI3 puncta and replication sites, and dsRNA, ERI3 and TGON2 were observed in close proximity to one another without direct colocalization observed (Fig. 6C). These results demonstrate that ERI3, as well as ER and Golgi markers, relocalize to replication sites in DENV-2 infected cells. Interestingly, these results suggest that both the ER and Golgi membranes are being remodeled in DENV-2-infected cells.",

Dominski (UNC, Chapel Hill). Several studies have established roles for 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 RNA exonucleases in viral replication. Lassa fever virus nucleoprotein has been shown to possess dsRNA-specific 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exonuclease activity that degrades dsRNA replication intermediates that can stimulate the host innate immune response27. Our studies suggest that ERI3 function in viral replication is not linked to the host innate immune response, since RT-qPCR analysis showed similar levels of IFN and ISG mRNA expression following infection in control and ERI3 knockdown cells (S2 Fig. E\u2013H). Coronavirus nsp14 has been shown to possess 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exonuclease activity that is required for maintaining replication fidelity of the viral RdRp282930. Since DENV-2 has been shown to undergo 3\u2032 end repair, it is possible that ERI3 is required for excision of non-templated nucleotides and maintenance of genome fidelity31. However, mutations that inactivate the proofreading activity of Coronavirus nsp14 had no effect on replication kinetics in tissue culture, suggesting that viral RNA synthesis and fidelity are not necessarily linked30. Moreover, our preliminary data suggest that exonuclease activity is not required for the pro-viral action of ERI3 (data not shown). While additional experiments are required to define the precise function in DENV-2 RNA synthesis, ERI3 could be an attractive host factor for therapeutic targeting in both humans and mosquitoes.",

However, in DENV-2-infected cells, ERI3 and the Golgi resident protein TGON2 relocalized near to sites of viral replication. Super-resolution imaging by Airyscan revealed that ERI3, as well as ER and Golgi markers, localized near viral replication sites, suggesting DENV-2 induces relocalization of these proteins to facilitate virus replication. Flaviviruses induce extensive membrane rearrangements during infection, and previous studies using DENV-2 implicated primarily ER-derived membranes67. In contrast, studies of membrane rearrangements induced by the Kunjin strain of WNV suggest that Golgi proteins are recruited to replication sites89. Furthermore, Brefeldin A inhibition of Golgi-ER retrograde transport has been shown to inhibit Kunjin virus replication, suggesting a critical role for Golgi proteins in Flavivirus replication32. Here, we present evidence that, in addition to ER-resident proteins, DENV-2 recruits Golgi-resident proteins to replication sites, highlighting a possible role for the Golgi in establishment or maintenance of viral replication. One model implicating Golgi proteins in DENV-2 replication is that they are required to establish replication sites in the ER membrane, either by initiating or stabilizing novel membrane structures in the ER. Indeed, several host factors, including Golgi-associated proteins, have been identified that mediate membrane deformation and establishment of DENV and other positive strand virus replication sites, including FASN and GBF133. However, it is not clear whether ERI3 provides a functional link between membrane remodeling and viral RNA synthesis or is simply recruited from the Golgi to replication sites for synthesis-specific functions.",
