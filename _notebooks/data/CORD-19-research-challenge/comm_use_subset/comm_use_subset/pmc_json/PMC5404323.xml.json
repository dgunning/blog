It interacts with the mucous layer and inhibits the mucolysis of intestinal epithelial cells in rabbit ileum infected with enteropathogenic Escherichia coli [2]. DS increases the resistance of the intestinal epithelium to toxic stimuli in humans [3]. It upregulates the colonic expression of MUC2, which is the main secretory mucin, thereby protecting the epithelium from the antigens produced during the inflammatory process [4]. In addition, DS restores the intestinal barrier function in an in vitro model of inflammation [5]. Previous studies have indicated that DS absorbs bacterial toxins, bacteria and viruses [6\u20138].",

The key treatment of AGE in children is the administration of oral rehydration solution (ORS) [9], but this neither shortens the duration of diarrhoea nor reduces the frequency of stool output. Therefore, active therapies are now recommended as an adjunct to ORS. The updated ESPGHAN/ESPID guidelines for managing children with gastroenteritis suggests the use of DS to reduce stool output [9] based on the results of randomized controlled clinical trials [10]. The latter have shown that DS reduces the stool volume in children with gastroenteritis, including those infected with RV [3, 11].",

Its severity is related to its mechanism of action, namely, a sequence of time-related mechanisms leading to secretory diarrhoea and intestinal epithelial damage [12]. In the early phase of infection, RV directly induces chloride and water secretion in the intestinal lumen through the enterotoxic effects of the non-structural viral protein NSP4. This increases the intracellular Ca2+ concentration and triggers electrogenic chloride secretion [12\u201314]. As recently reported, oxidative stress is a key mechanism in the enterotoxic effect induced by RV [14]. Following early ion secretion, RV infection results in severe damage to the structure of villi, with the disruption of epithelial integrity [15].",

In addition, DS reduced interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) secretion and decreased neutrophil infiltration and monocyte activation, which both contributed to a reduction of the antigenic load in hapten-induced colitis in the rat [4].

The efficacy of DS in protecting the integrity of the intestinal epithelium demonstrated in several previous studies was thought to be the result of the clay interacting with the intestinal mucosa. In this respect, it has been reported that DS acts as a physical barrier to toxic stimuli such as proinflammatory mediators [5], facilitates the secretion of MUC2 into the colon and increases the thickness of mucus [4].",

Although the remaining viral load was still sufficient to cause cell damage and spread infection in our model, the structural (cytotoxic) and functional (enterotoxic) consequences of RV infection were both strongly reduced. In particular, the number of Caco-2 cells infected with RV decreased in the presence of DS. In addition, the number of virions released in the culture medium was lower in cells infected with DS-treated RV rather than RV alone. This protective effect was maintained over three days following the infection. We therefore suggest that the anti-diarrhoeal effects of DS against RV are associated with a specific capacity of this clay to bind the virus, thus blocking both viral replication and the pathogenic effects of NSP4.",

RV is the main agent of infantile diarrhoea and is by far the most dangerous. However, DS is clinically effective against diarrhoea irrespective of the aetiology [11], and there is a need to understand whether the mechanisms described in this paper, which essentially consists of trapping viral particles and blocking downstream pathogenic events, may explain a more general effect against enteric pathogens. In addition to classic enterotoxic pathogens, several agents induce diarrhoea in all or in part by enterotoxic moieties, including Cryptosporidium and HIV virus [22]. If these results are also confirmed with these agents, an entirely new understanding of the antidiarrhoeal effects of DS may open new options for treating diarrhoea. This may also include inflammatory diarrhoea, as the latter is induced by endogenous secretagogues, particularly inflammatory cytokines or others inflammatory gut disease [23]. Clinical evidence of an effect by DS in inflammatory diarrhoea has been reported [11]. Similar considerations apply to endocrine diarrhoea and diarrhoea due to radiotherapy.",
