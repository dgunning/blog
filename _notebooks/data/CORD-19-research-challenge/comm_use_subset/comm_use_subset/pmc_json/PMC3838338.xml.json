The receptor of EIAV is equine lentivirus receptor 1 (ELR1), which was identified by Zhang et al. in 2005 using a functional cloning approach [4]. In contrast to most other lentiviruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), which require co-receptors for successful infection, EIAV appears to depend only on a functional ELR1 for the invasion of target cells. Based on its sequence and structural characteristics, ELR1 belongs to the TNF receptor (TNFR) superfamily [4], [5], and many receptors of this superfamily, such as the growth factor receptor, leptin receptor and Fas, also have soluble forms. Soluble forms have also been identified for some immunoglobulins and chemokine receptors [6]\u2013[8].",

The release of membrane-associated forms from the cell surface contributes significantly to the formation of soluble receptors at the posttranslational level; this process is usually catalyzed by enzymes and highly is regulated. In addition, the alterative splicing of mRNAs during the maturation of eukaryotic pro-mRNA is another mechanism for the formation of soluble receptors. The translation of receptor mRNA can be prematurely terminated due to alterative splicing, which produces receptors that lack the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains [6], [7], [9].",

The soluble receptors for HIV-1, EBV (Epstein-Barr virus) and rhinovirus are reportedly able to inhibit infection by the corresponding viruses [11], [14], [15]. Another study found that the soluble form of the avian sarcoma leukosis virus subgroup A (ASLV-A) receptor Tva (sTva) inhibited the infectivity of this virus by 90% at a low concentration (25 pM) but mediated ASLV-A infection in cells lacking the receptor at a high concentration (5 nM) [16]. Brindley et al. demonstrated that preincubation of EIAV with the soluble ectodomain of ELR1 dramatically reduced the viral infectivity on the target cells [17]. These data further implicate soluble viral receptors in the interaction between viruses and their host cells.",

The expression of membrane-associated or soluble ELR1 was examined by Western blot using a monoclonal antibody against the HA tag (Sigma, USA) fused to the receptor at the C-terminus. Protein bands reacting with the HA antibody were visualized using a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Sigma, USA). To perform confocal imaging, 293T cells seeded on coverslips were transfected with the HA-tagged sELR1 or ELR1 expression vectors. After 72 h of incubation, transfected cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min. Cells were blocked with PBS/FISH GELATIN (5%) for 2 h, reacted with anti-HA monoclonal Ab for 1 h and then incubated with an anti-mouse IgG (whole molecule)-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled antibody (F2012, Sigma). Cells were washed with PBS for three times and then stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma) for 30 min and examined using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal system (Leica Microsystems, Germany). Appropriate IgG isotype controls were included to rule out non-specific binding. In addition, a 3D live cell imaging system (UltraView Vox, PerkinElmer, USA) was applied to observe the dynamically distribution of the sELR1 and ELR1 that fused to GFP at the N-terminus after being transiently expressed in 293T cells.",

Most genes in eukaryotes are alternatively spliced into several forms, and the percentage of these genes can be as high as 93% in humans [22]. Through such a mechanism, multiple proteins with different functions can be produced from a single gene, thus providing an opportunity for adaptation to different environments [23]. Multiple alternative splicing variants of ELR were identified in this study for the first time. The predominant isoform that produces a functional ELR1 is a species of 942 bp containing exons 1\u20139. The other two major isoforms include ELR1-IN, which contains an insertion of a fragment of intron 6, and ELR-DE, in which exon 3 is deleted following splicing. These three major forms of spliced mRNA exhibit distinct expression levels and ratios in different individuals and at different time points.",

It is known that abnormal transcript variants, such as intron retentions, are occasionally generated in cells but normally do not exist long enough to have a functional impact. In addition, it has been reported that, although intron retention events are common in human genes, their frequency relative to the dominant transcript is generally low [22], [25]. Our results demonstrated that ELR1-IN differed from a typical intron retention transcript: it contained a fragment of an intron and appeared with a high frequency compared with the predominant transcript of ELR1 (approximately 25%). ELR1-IN was consistently detected in different individuals at different times, and it was translated into a functional soluble ELR1 when the recombinant molecule was expressed. In addition, we did not find the typical \u201cGT/AG\u201d and \u201cGC/AG\u201d splicing sites in these spliced ELR1 variants. However, due to the absence of a sufficient equine alternative splicing database, the splicing model of ELR1-IN remains unclear [24].",

            "text": "Because soluble viral receptors containing virus-binding motif(s) can be used as valuable tools for evaluating viral entrance into target cells, these molecules have played important roles in studies of virus-host interactions [26], [27]. It was reported that the co-incubation of soluble CD4 with HIV-1 envelope protein resulted in the dissociation of the gp120 surface protein and gp45 transmembrane protein [6], [28]. CD4 is also the cellular receptor of HIV-1, HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus SIVmac and SIVagm. The soluble form of CD4 (sCD4) can block HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection in human lymphoma cell lines, but it enhances SIVagm infection in these cell lines by 10 to 100-fold [29]. A similar augmenting effect of soluble viral receptors on the invasion of viruses was also observed in studies on herpes simplex virus (HSV) [30], [31]. In addition, a study on Jaagsiekte retrovirus (JSRV) found that although the soluble form of its receptor, Hyal2 (sHyal2), did not mediate the entrance of a JSRV-pseudotype retroviral vector into cells lacking the integrated Hyal2, this purified soluble protein significantly inhibited the infection of the pseudotyped vector in the target cells of JSRV [13]. Moreover, some soluble receptors in the plasma can be considered markers of disease progression, such as soluble TNF receptor (sTNFR) II and soluble IL-2 and IL-6 receptors in HIV-1-infected patients [10], [14], [32]. Therefore, soluble receptors play important roles in the interactions between viruses and hosts [33]\u2013[37]. Studies on the mechanisms regulating the formation of soluble viral receptors should lead to a better understanding of the cellular responses to invading viruses.",

Additionally, the expression levels of ELR1 and its alternative splicing variants were regulated by EIAV infection. In a separate study on the restriction of EIAV superinfection, we found that the up-regulation of sELR1 induced by the initially infected viral strain was correlated with protection against subsequent viral infection (unpublished data). At present, it remains unclear whether the inhibitory effect of sELR1 on EIAV infection is based on the competition of the binding of the virus to membrane-associated ELR1 or on the polymerization with EIR1, which may trigger or may reduce signal transduction of membrane-associated receptors, therefore interfering with the expression of downstream cellular proteins [6]. However, our data indicate that sELR1 is not merely a truncated product of a spliced ELR1 transcript but is a functional protein with important biological roles. ELR1 is a member of the TNFR superfamily, which is known to have important roles in regulating immune responses and inducing pathological outcomes [4], [38]. Previous studies have shown that plasma TNF\u03b1 concentration is positively correlated with the clinical symptoms of EIAV-infected horses [18]. It was also reported that sTNFR was significantly elevated in patients with HIV-1 infection [10]. Because ELR1 acts as both the receptor of EIAV and a member of TNFR family, the finding that sELR1 is regulatable and can compete its membrane-associated prototype form implicates the involvement of this soluble protein in both of the viral infectivity and the host response, especially that TNF\u03b1 is closely related with EIA symptoms. The possible role of sELR1 in ELR1 signaling is an interesting question to be explored.",
