With regard to the findings obtained in our study, this limitation of self-report data could have led to an underestimation of the extent of healthcare utilization. It seems unlikely that persons reported non-existent hospital stays or contacts to a physician; but contacts with the healthcare system might have been omitted or not been correctly recalled\u2014particularly with regard to ambulatory health care and in people who used healthcare services extensively [31, 32].",

However, one might speculate that these persons utilized health services even more often. Further, a considerable proportion of study participants were lost to follow-up.
