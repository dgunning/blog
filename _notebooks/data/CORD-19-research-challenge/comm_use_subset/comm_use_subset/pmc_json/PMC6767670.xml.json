            "text": "However, the above exoskeletons have many actuators, and the size of the exoskeleton is large. As a result, modular exoskeletons have been developed. Modular exoskeletons do not support the entire lower body but only support some joints. In this study, a knee modular exoskeleton is developed. Using an exoskeleton on the knee is difficult because it has a complicated structure [6]. When the wearer wears the exoskeleton, it restricts knee movement because of the complicated movements of the knee joint. Therefore, numerous studies have attempted to design an exoskeleton that aligns with the complex knee movements. Schmidt coupling has been used to accommodate the large radial displacement between two shafts [7], and link systems have also been used to self-align the exoskeleton [8]. The planar parallel robot possesses three degrees of freedom (DoFs) to enable self-alignment [9]. However, the disadvantage of these studies was that the volume of the actuator was large. There are the exoskeletons that have a prismatic degree of freedom to self-align with the complex movements of the knee [10,11,12]. Due to this structure, the exoskeleton does not limit the wearer\u2019s range of motion moreover there is no need to enlarge the volume of actuator. The difference between [10,11,12] and the exoskeleton suggested in this paper is that the proposed exoskeleton has the structure which measures the change of the center of rotation. Though the change of the center of rotation is measured in [12], they use the displacement sensor which is attached on the tibia model. However, the proposed exoskeleton in this paper can be equipped to actual wearer because the sensor is attached inside the exoskeleton. In this paper, the movement of the center of rotation was measured and used to detect intention. As a result, the intention is detected by using the data obtained by only one leg. ",

Because it uses air pressure, the device is large, which makes the exoskeleton safe, but the exhaust noise is too loud, and position and speed control are difficult. An exoskeleton that uses a series elastic actuator (SEA) with low internal friction and impedance has also been proposed. SEA can measure the applied torque using an elastomeric element, so torque control is easy [14]. Exoskeletons using a wire-driven actuator that receives power through a wire with an externally installed motor have also been proposed [15]. The proposed exoskeleton uses a wire driven structure. It solves the problem of the weight of the motor, which accounts for most of the weight in the exoskeleton. ",

By using EMGs, data can be obtained faster than actual motion, but it is vulnerable to noise and hard to initialize. Some studies have used an encoder or an inertia measurement unit (IMU) [18]. The encoder is used to measure the angle of the joint, and IMU is used such as measuring the posture of the waist. A new type of sensor has also been developed that estimates the torque by sensing the movement of the muscles using air pressure [19]. In the proposed exoskeleton, we propose the sensors structure to measure the knee joint angle and the length between the knee center of rotation and the ankle (LBKA).",

An active DoF is used to assist knee flexion and extension. A passive prismatic DoF and passive rotation DoF are provided to the ankle to align with the knee axis and to measure LBKA, which varies with the angle of the knee. The angle of the knee, \u03b8, is measured using the encoder of the motor. The exoskeleton is designed with three sections, a torque output section, a driving section, and a variable ankle section.",

A linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) is generally used to measure length, but such a sensor is expensive, large, and difficult to install. Instead of using an LVDT sensor, the length is measured by using a sliding variable resistor, of which the resistance varies linearly with length. It is inexpensive, small, and easy to install. The measured spring displacement is used in the proportional-derivative (PD) controller to minimize the load. A more detailed description of this wire driven actuator and friction compensation will be given in Section 3.1.",

Therefore, when the sliding variable resister is directly fixed to the ankle part, sliding movement friction of the sliding variable resister increases because of rotation of the ankle part.

To prevent this, the prismatic part is connected to the sliding variable resister to move prismatically along the lower frame pipe, and the ankle part is free to rotate around the prismatic part.

The left side of Figure shows the straightened knee, and the right side of the figure shows the bent knee.

The length between the tibia plane and center of rotation is decreased by \u0394ltc because of bending. The length of lower frame when the wearer bends the knee lj_b is obtained as follows:(2)lj_b=lta+ltc_b\n(3)ltc_b=ltc_s\u2212\u0394ltc\nwhere ltc_b. is the length between the tibia plane and the center of rotation when the knee is bent.

As a result, the wearer feels uncomfortable, and the exoskeleton limits the wearer\u2019s range of motion. To solve this problem, the length of the margin can be changed because the ankle part is designed to have a prismatic passive DoF. When straightened, the exoskeleton has a length margin of lv_s. When the wearer bends the knee, length of lower frame decreases by \u0394ltc. As a result, the length margin of the exoskeleton increases by \u0394ltc, so the length of the margin becomes lv_b. when the wearer bends the knee:(4)lv_b=lv_s+\u0394ltc",

Since the pattern of each state is not complicated, the number of hidden layers was set to 15 to avoid overfitting, and the number of datasets in each state was also adjusted to avoid overfitting. In addition, the number of training datasets for the exception state, which is difficult to train because there is no fixed pattern, is more than the training datasets of other states.

The exoskeleton is efficient because the wearer can wear it only on the leg in which the wearer needs assistance. In addition, by using a wire driven actuator, a heavy motor is installed on torque output section to reduce the load due to inertia force. The actuator was back-drivable using the friction compensation algorithm, resulting in a maximum measured load of 0.33 N. A simple self-alignment structure was applied and the change of LBKA value is measured by self-alignment structure. Experimental results show that the measured LBKA value reflects the movement of the wearer\u2019s knee joint well and is measured without delay unlike the encoder of a motor. Therefore, the intention can be detected only by the sensor of one leg. As a result of testing the training intention detection algorithm for the wearer\u2019s various motions, it was confirmed that the intention detection works well in all cases when different motions are mixed, period is different, and input pattern is similar.",
