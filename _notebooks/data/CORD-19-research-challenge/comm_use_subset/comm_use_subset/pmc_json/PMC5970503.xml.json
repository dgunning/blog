Among them, PEDV, TGEV, PDCoV and PRoV have been well characterized for their role in clinical diarrhea and have been considered as major swine enteric viral pathogens while the causative role of the other agents in diarrheic disease has been characterized to a significantly less extent or remains to be further studied.",

In North America, PEDV was first detected in the United States (US) in 2013, which rapidly spread across the US in the subsequent 2 years [2\u20134]. The diarrhea caused by PEDV can result in dehydration in suckling piglets and eventually up to 100% mortality, which caused significant economic loss to the US swine industry [5, 6].",

The random primers-based, hypothesis-free High-throughput sequencing (HTS) enables simultaneous detection of multiple microorganisms, making it possible to identify not only known pathogens, but also novel and/or uncharacterized potential pathogens. In this study, a HTS-based metagenomics approach was used to characterize the fecal RNA virome in diarrheic pigs infected with PEDV.

Cleaned reads were classified with the standard database Kraken v0.10.5-beta including pig host, refseq virus, bacteria, and archaea sequences (Fig. 1) [11]. KronaTools-2.6 was then used to generate the interactive charts for the hierarchical classification results and any classified organisms can be viewed in these pie charts [12].

Of these 159 samples with mixed viral infection, 1 sample (0.5%) were detected with 9 RNA viral genera including PEDV (alphacoronavirus genus, Fig. 2). One hundred and forty-eight samples (68%) contained at least 2 to 6 different viral genera while 10 samples (5%) had 7 to 8 viral genera detected including alphacoronavirus. There was no sample found to be infected with all 10 detected viral genera in the current study. The above taxonomic classification results from Kraken analysis based on nucleic acid level were also confirmed by Kaiju on protein level, as shown by the same total 10 viral genera detection, and the high agreement (average agreement rate = 90.5%) in taxonomic classification between the two programs.",

These applications have revolutionized infectious disease diagnostics and clinical microbiology. Therefore, HTS technology has obvious advantages over traditional diagnostic methods. However, most clinical samples are very \u201cdirty\u201d and composed of both host and microbial nucleic acids; in most cases, 99% of nucleic acid contained in samples belong to either the host or other microorganisms of no interest.

In addition, at least two different lineages of PEDV are co-circulating in North American and Asian countries [23, 24], compromising vaccine-based control strategies. A majority of previous studies focused on PEDV evolution and pathogenicity whereas only two studies investigated the changes detected in the fecal microbiota from pigs with PEDV infection [25, 26], both of which only focused on the changes of bacterial profiles in pigs infected with PEDV. Utilizing HTS to characterize the virome of diarrheal pigs, four previous studies reported that significantly higher percentages of RNA viral sequences were detected than that of DNA viral sequences [1, 27\u201329]. However, the aforementioned studies only utilized limited numbers of diarrheal pigs (\u226450) and the role of PEDV in the sick pigs was not clear.

Such findings are similar to a previous report [27]. This may have been attributed to the well-understood fact that picornaviruses are highly resistant in the environment and as such, usually survive much longer than other viruses [30]. The environmentally resistant picornaviruses can have a longer exposure time in pigs, increasing the odds of infection and their prevalence when compared to other viruses. Furthermore, the viruses also have better odds of detection in the environment after shedding. Both of these factors can increase the detection rate of picornaviruses from clinical samples, as compared to other viruses. Although the longer surviving feature of picornaviruses makes them easier to detect, such nature may bias their proportion in mixed infections.",

It was also demonstrated in this study that there are at least two genogroups of Aichivirus C (PKV-1) circulating in US swine. Currently, Aichivirus C-specific virological and serological diagnostic assays have not been available in most veterinary diagnostic laboratories. Availability of more Aichivirus C sequences will help understand genetic diversity of this virus and facilitate development of appropriate diagnostic assays. The clinical significance of Aichivirus C also remains to be elucidated.",
