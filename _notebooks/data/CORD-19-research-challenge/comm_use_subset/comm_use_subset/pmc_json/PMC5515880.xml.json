            "text": "It has been hypothesized that dimerization and possibly oligomerization of CoV N proteins plays an essential role in virus particle assembly21\u201325. The ability of SARS-CoV N protein to self-interact was first demonstrated using yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation experiments26. The crystal structures of the N2b/CTD domain of SARS-CoV and MHV N proteins confirmed this observation, leading to the notion that N protein dimers are the basic building blocks of the ribonucleoprotein complex12, 23, 24, 27\u201329. Subsequently, native gel electrophoresis, size exclusion chromatography and surface plasmon resonance revealed that recombinant SARS-CoV N protein forms oligomers in vitro, although it appears to predominantly exist as a dimer in solution in absence of gRNA30. Size exclusion chromatography and chemical cross-linking assays were also used to unveil that the N2b/CTD domain of the SARS-CoV N protein, in particular the stretch of amino acids between positions 343\u2013402, forms autonomously oligomers in solution31, 32. The N2b/CTD domain of the MHV N protein has also been shown to bind full length protein11. However, few other studies indicated that other parts of the N protein could also be involved in the self-interaction. In particular, the N1b/NTD and N3 domains could bind full length MHV N protein11, 19 while the serine-rich (SR) region located within the N2a could be essential for SAR-CoV N protein self-interaction and oligomerization33. Nonetheless, the current most commonly accepted working model is that CoV N protein constitutively dimerizes, primarily via the N2b/CTD domain, and subsequently oligomerizes during virion assembly through a mechanism that remains unclear22, 23, 27, 29, 32, 34\u201336. It is also unclear whether gRNA binding influences CoV N protein oligomerization.",

However, we could also show that, besides N2b/CTD, several domains of the N protein are involved in this process. Analysis of different MHV and SARS-CoV N protein truncations revealed that at least three regions of these proteins cross-interact between each other in an interchangeable manner. Moreover, we show that two of these regions, i.e. N1 and N2b-N3, can oligomerize autonomously. Further, in infected cells, the MHV N protein forms oligomers already in the cytoplasm and its oligomerization does not require binding to gRNA. Altogether these findings indicate that CoV N proteins self-interact and oligomerize via discontinuous regions present in domains distributed over the entire protein to generate large supra-complexes. We hypothesize that these oligomers, which are formed constitutively, provide a larger binding surface for the gRNA, which will be thus optimally engaged at the RTCs and subsequently incorporated into forming viral particles.",

Since order-disorder and secondary structure predictions coupled with sequence alignment has highlighted that all CoV N proteins have the modular organization as MHV N protein, we used this as a model first. Hence, MHV N protein was expressed in E. coli as a GST fusion construct and purified using glutathione Sepharose (GSH-beads). The immobilized GST fusion protein or GST was incubated with bacterial cell extract of E. coli expressing recombinant 6xHis-tagged full length MHV N protein. As illustrated in Fig. 1b, recombinant 6xHis-tagged N protein specifically bound GST-N protein but not GST alone, which is in agreement with previous reports19, 23, 24, 27\u201329 and further shows that N proteins self-interact directly.",

We generated cell extracts (Ext) from MHV-infected LR7 cells and centrifuged them at 15,000 \u00d7 g to discard the pellet P13, which includes compartments with low sedimentation rates such as whole cells or debris, nuclei and mitochondria. The resulting supernatant S13 was subsequently centrifuged at 110,000 \u00d7 g to sediment organelles such as the Golgi apparatus but also virions that could have remained associated to the cell surface at the moment of the lysis43, 44. Successful fractionation of each step was followed by visualization of the membrane bound protein VAPA for P1345 as well as the cytoplasmic proteins GAPDH and tubulin for S45, which also contained soluble N protein (Fig. 2a).

We thus generated three 6xHis-tagged truncations, i.e. N1 (which contains the NTD), N2a and N2b-N3 (which contains the CTD), which collectively cover the full length of the N protein (Fig. 1a). These constructs were expressed in E. coli and the resulting bacterial extracts were incubated with either immobilized GST or GST-N protein. Interestingly, all three analyzed N protein truncations specifically bound GST-N protein but not GST alone (Fig. 3, top panel), further revealing that in addition to the reported N2b/CTD region, the N protein possesses binding domains for the self-interaction in the N1 and N2a parts as well.\n",

As depicted in Fig. 4b, recombinant SARS-CoV N1-N2a protein specifically binds to GST-SARS-CoV N1-N2a protein but not GST alone, revealing that the N-terminal N1-N2a domain self-interacts.

Similarly to MHV, however, SARS-CoV-N2a was unable to self-interact and form oligomers (Supplementary Fig. S3).

We and others, however, have already pointed out that the N-terminal N1b/NTD and N3 regions could also interact with full length of MHV N protein11, 19. Our data extends and completes the information acquired by these investigations as we found that at least three areas of MHV N protein, i.e. N1a-N1b, N2a and N2b-N3, mediate its self-interaction. Importantly, those domains can bind reciprocally between themselves (Fig. 3) and our findings provide a possible model for MHV N protein oligomerization, i.e. a single N molecule appears to have several binding sites that allow the association of multiple N protein units to a single oligomer. However, we cannot exclude that binding promiscuousity and affinity of the various N protein domains, which we have investigated using truncated proteins, are more limited and different, respectively, in the context of the full-length protein.",

This is in agreement with a report indicating that the N2a domain, in particular the SR region within it, could play a role for SARS-CoV N protein self-interaction and oligomerization33. Further, the N2a domain is known to interact with the nonstructural protein nsp3 via a serine and arginine rich stretch within that domain9\u201311.

            "text": "Our attempts to narrow down the specific binding area within the various regions have been unsuccessful since it appears that the amino acids crucial for the N protein self-interaction are discontinuously distributed (Fig. 3). The results obtained with the N2a truncation indirectly support this notion as a short domain will possess less key binding amino acids and consequently it will interact less pronouncedly compared to longer parts such as the N1 and N2b-N3 domains. Previous efforts to localize the residues essential to mediate SARS-CoV N2b-N3 (including the CTD) multimerization identified three different regions within this domain22, 31, 34, further underscoring the notion that discontinues binding regions, distributed over the entire N molecule, are responsible for the self-association. During the preparation of this manuscript, a cryo-EM analysis of ribonucleoprotein complexes isolated MHV virions was published and the model emerging from this work is consistent with our findings48. This study suggested that the N protein form octamers mainly via its CTD domain, which then further assembles into larger oligomeric structures that can acquire either a loose or a more compact intertwined filament shape48. In the proposed model, multiple surfaces of the N protein participate in the multimerization of the N protein octamer and this is coherent with our conclusion that several domains in the N protein mediate self-interaction.",

            "text": "One important finding of our study is that cytoplasmic MHV N protein forms high molecular weight oligomers in infected cells. Similarly to the recombinant protein, we could not detect monomers, dimers or small multimers on glycerol gradients (Fig. 2b) suggesting that after synthesis, MHV N protein rapidly assembles into oligomers. It is easy to imagine that, based on our in vitro data, this is very likely also the case for the SARS-CoV N protein. Since all CoV N proteins have an identical modular organization21 and have the N1b, N2a and N2b domains, oligomerization could be a characteristic that all of them possess. It has been suggested that gRNA promotes MHV N protein self-interaction because the association process was partially or largely susceptible to RNase A treatment11, 35. Another study, however, reached the opposite conclusion19, which is also supported by structural biology studies where N protein multimers have been detected and analyzed in preparations that do not contain RNA12, 22\u201324, 27, 29, 32, 36, 49. Our data showing that both in vivo and in vitro N protein oligomerization does not depend on its binding to gRNA are in agreement with this latter conclusion. It cannot be excluded, however, that association to gRNA could promote further N protein oligomerization. This could explain the partial discrepancy with the study showing that RNase A treatment interferes with the binding between the N protein and full-length N protein or N1b/NTD domain, but not with the N2b/CTD region11.",

In agreement with this notion, which has already been proposed for CoV N proteins40, 53, our hypothesis is that recruitment of already formed N protein oligomers to the RTCs at DMVs and convoluted membranes via the interaction with nsp39, 10, allows efficient and tight loading of the exceptionally large gRNA via numerous binding sites into a ribonucleoprotein complex (Fig. 5). This RNA chaperone role of N protein oligomers would assure the efficient incorporation of the gRNA into the assembling virions, other scenarios, however, are also possible and future investigations will help to decipher the functional relevance of CoV N protein oligomerization.\n",
