HSV-2 is a major global health concern with an estimated 123 million people infected in Sub-Saharan Africa (15\u201349 years) compared with 29.8 million in the US and 20.9 million in Europe [1,2]. Long term treatment of HSV-2 infection with anti-viral drugs has been successful in managing the disease by reducing recurrent activation, limiting viral shedding and reducing transmission of the virus. Although therapeutic treatments are widely available, development of a prophylactic vaccine to achieve sterilizing immunity is highly desirable. Two clinical vaccine studies aimed at generating neutralizing antibodies and CD4+ T cell responses have resulted in limited success. The former prophylactic vaccine delivered HSV-2 glycoproteins (gD and gB) in combination with the adjuvant MF59 and generated neutralizing antibodies but demonstrated transient efficacy in only a minor cohort of individuals [3,4]. Another prophylactic approach used the HSV-2 glycoprotein-D-subunit vaccine with alum and 3-O-deacylated-monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) though efficacy was only observed in HSV-1 and HSV-2 seronegative females [5,6].

Increased knowledge of CD8+ T cell epitope sequences will aid vaccine design by the incorporation of immunogenic peptide sequences into vaccines and allow detailed phenotypic analysis and characterization of the kinetics of the cellular immune response after immunization. The underlying mechanistic T cell control of HSV-2 is not well understood, however emerging data has highlighted the importance of CD8+ T cell control in HSV-2 reactivation and for maintaining but not establishing latency [10,11]. Zhu et al. have shown that CD8+ T cells have a key role in the control and progression of HSV-2 by localizing at the site of infection [12]. Adoptive transfer experiments using OVA specific CD8+ T cells in HSV-2 Tk-OVA infected mice resulted in clearance of infection that could be reversed by the in vivo neutralization of IFN-\u03b3 [13]. Interestingly, the protein ICP4 has recently been shown to be the target of granzyme B mediated degradation, which results in non lethal viral inactivation [14]. CD8+ T cells were shown to control viral reactivation in cultured trigeminal ganglia (TG) from HSV-2 infected mice. Depleting CD8+ T cells from cultures promoted increased rates of HSV-2 reactivation [15]. Clinical studies evaluating the diversity of CD8+ restricted T cell responses to HSV-2 proteins have shown that the greatest frequency of responses are directed against tegument proteins but are only found in 50% of patients [16] and that CD4+ responses are broader than CD8+ [17]. The CD8+, IFN-\u03b3+ T cell responses were restricted to the VP22, ICP0 and ICP4 antigens with no additional responses detected ex vivo for ICP27, ICP22 or gD proteins. These important findings indicate that tegument protein specific T cells may play an important role in controlling HSV-2 infection and provide attractive opportunities for immune intervention. ",

With limited epitope information available on ICP27, VP22 and VP13/14 we sought to identify epitope sequences in a preclinical BALB/c mouse model using a combination of computational prediction, ELISpot and flow cytometry methods. Responses to VP22 and VP13/14 have also been demonstrated in humans [22]. Translational studies using HLA-A*02-peptide binding assays and human T cell lines generated by peptide driven expansions from well conserved ICP27, VP22, and VP13/14 epitope sequences exhibited functional activity in response to their cognate peptide stimulation in vitro. In order to induce CD8+ T cell responses to HSV-2 proteins through active immunization, we constructed DNA vaccines encoding full length ICP27, VP22, and VP13/14 proteins. To facilitate strong MHC class I mediated expression of viral proteins, DNA was delivered using the proprietary gold particle mediated epidermal delivery (PMEDTM) with the ND10 delivery device [23]. CD8+ T cell responses were evaluated using ELISpot and mobilization of CD107a after peptide stimulation. Epitope specific T cell responses generated from PMED DNA immunization showed a narrowed and more focused T cell response towards ICP27, VP22 and VP13/14 as compared with HSV-2 infection in BALB/c mice. These T cell epitopes may facilitate vaccine design and aid immunomonitoring of peptide specific T cell responses in pre-clinical and clinical studies.",

BALB/c mice were infected with HSV-2 and monitored for 14 days before spleens were removed and harvested for splenocytes. IFN-\u03b3 ELISpots were used to measure T cell responses after overnight stimulation with peptide. Intra-vaginal infection of mice with HSV-2 strain 333 resulted in a broad detectable cellular immune response towards ICP27, VP22 and VP13/14 (Figure 1 A,B,C and Table 2). The previously reported mouse epitope ICP27(318-326) elicited a strong response after infection (n = 4) as expected. Peptide sequences that have not been previously described for ICP27(500-508), ICP27(459-467), ICP27(479-486), and ICP27(428-436) were also positive for IFN-\u03b3 T cell responses (\u226590SFC/million splenocytes) after peptide stimulation. Interestingly, overlapping amino acid sequences from ICP27(314-322) and ICP27(319-327) gave lower responses than ICP27(318-326) (Figure 1A). Strong peptide specific responses were seen with ICP27(462-470) and ICP27(500-508) which were comparable to the published sequence ICP27(318-326) (Figure 1A). Further epitope screening of VP22 and VP13/14 peptides resulted in three strongly positive epitopes being identified (VP22(46-54), VP22(171-179) and VP22(200-208)) and two from VP13/14 (VP13/14(244-252) and VP13/14(592-600)) shown in Figure 1B and Figure 1C. Splenocytes pulsed with individual peptides from naive mice (n = 2) gave background responses below 16.5 SFC per million splenocytes (Table 2). Although identification of potential epitopes in mice is highly informative, further work is required to assess the involvement of T cell subsets that are able to induce IFN-\u03b3 production. We have made use of peptides that span 9 amino acids which have a natural affinity for MHC class I molecules, however it has been shown that the MHC class II molecule requires a 9mer sequence to obtain core binding [25,26]. To exclude the possibility of CD4+ mediated IFN-\u03b3 responses after infection with HSV-2, cells sorted for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells may be used in peptide pulsing studies. Additionally, measurement of total IFN-\u03b3 positive responses to whole virus, protein or a full set of overlapping peptides spanning the full length of viral antigens would allow ranking of the magnitude of peptide specific responses. From the predicted IC50 binding values it is apparent which BALB/c allele each peptide is restricted to, however experimental validation using cell lines expressing H2 molecules are required for detailed pre-clinical MHC-peptide tetrameric and phenotypic analysis of peptide specific T cells are required. The identification of epitopes in HSV-2 viral proteins were identified in an infection setting with a virus presenting multiple H2 restricted T cell epitopes from different proteins. To translate our findings with clinical significance it is necessary to determine human HLA-A*02 restricted epitopes in HSV-2 proteins.",

T2 cells were used to determine the affinity index of peptides able to bind and stabilize HLA-A*02 MHC molecules. Figure 2A shows the AI for all 44 peptides calculated from mean fluorescent intensities. Four peptide sequences, ICP27(314-322) ,VP22(146-154) ,VP22(173-181) , VP13/14(242-250) were able to reach an AI > 1.5 (high affinity) and ICP27(428-436) scored 1.42 (intermediate affinity) (Figure 2A). Figure 2B shows shift in intensity of HLA-A*02 on T2 cells for the strongest ICP27, VP22 and VP13/14 peptide binders. The human donors had no history of HSV-2 infection, but are likely to have been exposed to HSV-1. Alignment of the HLA-A*02 restricted peptides identified for HSV-2 with the sequences for HSV-1 ICP27, VP22 and VP13/14 proteins showed close homology for three out of four peptides. Although samples from our donors required repetitive in vitro re-stimulation in order to identify specific responses, there have been reports demonstrating HSV-2 specific T cells in seronegative individuals [28] which is similar to T cells found in HIV-1 exposed but uninfected individuals [29,30,31].

These studies included a single 35 amino acid peptide from ICP27 (amino acids 410-444), but did not include any peptides from VP22 or VP13/14. The aim of those studies was to generate both CD4+ and CD8+ cellular immunity. We have described a peptide from the same region of ICP27 (amino acids 428-436) with an intermediate affinity for HLA-A2 that induced reactive CD8+ T cells in natural infection (Table 3) and also described a further peptide from ICP27 (314-322) that had a higher affinity for HLA-A2 (Figure 2A), and a stronger response in our donor (Table 3). It is not apparent from the published preclinical study what impact the ICP27 peptide had in the vaccine, nor is it possible to say whether the alternative peptide we identified would improve efficacy. However, it is important for future vaccine design to be able to identify the best candidate peptides for driving strong immune responses that can provide clinical efficacy. ",

DNA vaccine delivery using the PMED gene gun has demonstrated success in the clinic and provides a safe and alternative approach to needle based intramuscular delivery requiring milligrams of DNA [34,35,36]. Gold particles containing 2 \u00b5g of DNA were given as a single actuation to the shaved abdomen of BALB/c mice without adjuvant. Mice were then given a second booster vaccine 29 days after the primary immunization. Spleens were removed on day 40 to assess T cell responses using IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot and mobilization of CD107a after peptide stimulation (Figure 4 A-G and Table 2). Table 2 shows the peptide specific IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot responses after DNA vaccination to each HSV-2 protein. Strong ICP27 specific responses were observed to the previously unidentified ICP27(500-508) epitope (247 SFC/million PBL), with the strongest response restricted to the ICP27(318-326) epitope (304 SFC/million PBL). Interestingly no other T cell responses were seen to epitopes that elicited ICP27 specific T cells after HSV-2 infection. This finding suggests that vaccine driven responses to ICP27 generated T cells to immunodominant sequences. CD107a mobilization shows broad degranulation of ICP27 peptide specific CD8+ T cells with frequencies in excess of background levels (Figure 4B, E and F). Interestingly, IFN-\u03b3 positive responses were only seen for the VP22 (200-208) epitope after VP22 DNA immunization. In contrast, 3.6% and 1.7% (including irrelevant peptide background subtraction) of total CD8+ T cells degranulated after VP22(46-54) and VP22(200-208) after peptide stimulation respectively (Figure 4B and C). Collectively, this data illustrates potential immunodominance and broad functionality of cytokine secreting CD8+ T cells raised after DNA immunization. Similarly like ICP27, strong IFN-\u03b3 T cell responses were observed to the VP22 epitopes, VP22(46-54), VP22(171-179) and VP22(200-208) after infection with HSV-2. CD8+ T cells degranulating in response to VP13/14(244-252) and VP13/14(592-600) peptide stimulation after VP13/14 DNA immunization were present at a modest frequency of 1.3% of total CD8+ T cells. ",

Vaccinated mice were challenged with HSV-2 to investigate the potential of these responses to protect against infection in both intravaginal and intranasal challenge models. Vaccination of mice with ICP27 provided protection against viral shedding in the intravaginal model, with five out of eight animals shedding no virus at either one or four days post infection compared with three out of eight controls (Figure 5A). Mean viral titers were 225 and 8590 for vaccinated and unvaccinated groups at day four post-infection, respectively. Vaccinated mice demonstrated a trend towards lower clinical scores than unvaccinated counterparts, although this was not demonstrably significant (Figure 5B). Vaccination with ICP27 was more protective in the intranasal challenge model, with vaccinated mice showing reduced clinical scores and a delayed onset of more significant disease (Figure 5C). ",

Additional work using T cell lines and clones sorted from HSV-2 patients in transwell and migration experiments may allow better understanding of therapeutic approaches to control or eliminate HSV-2 from infected cells. CD8+ T cell recruitment to sites of infection has recently been shown to depend heavily upon CXCR3+ CD4+ T cell induced mobilization through the CXCL9 and CXCL10 gradient [37]. This important finding suggests that vaccines should be designed to induce both CD8+ T cells with CD4+ T cell help. Live imaging techniques using antigen specific T cell adoptive transfer experiments in RAG knockout mice would provide valuable data on localization of T cells and subsequent mode of action. ",

            "text": "It has been shown for vaccinia virus that the route of infection may skew peptide specific responses to certain epitopes or enhance and diminish dominant CD8+ T cell responses [38,39,40]. In this study, we have not assessed intra-ocular or other routes of infection. Furthermore, rational single amino acid modifications to peptides known to elicit a stimulatory response may enhance immunogenicity and therefore result in a more favorable outcome in an epitope based vaccine and disease challenge setting [41]. ICP27, VP22 and VP13/14 DNA vaccines delivered using the PMED ND10 device elicited strong CD107a+/CD8+ T cells after peptide stimulation. It is interesting to note that the peptide specific T cell frequencies could not be compared between T cells positive for CD107a expression and IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot after peptide stimulation. Furthermore, BALB/c mice infected with HSV-2 showed a greater frequency of T cells specific for ICP27 and VP22 epitopes than mice immunized with DNA vaccines (Table 2). It is important to note that mice infected with HSV-2 also displayed a greater coverage of epitope specific responses than with DNA vaccination which skewed ICP27 and VP22 specific responses to ICP27(318-326), ICP27(500-508) and VP22(200-208) epitopes. Due to the polyfunctional nature of T cells generated through vaccination, further work is required to dissect the proportion of HSV-2 pentamer/tetramer specific CD8+/CD107a+ cells capable of mounting IFN-\u03b3+, IL-2+ and TNF-\u03b1+ responses. Further translational experiments using HLA-A*02 restricted epitopes described in this study on HLA-A*02+ infected transgenic mice or HSV-2 seropositive donors may provide a clearer understanding of the frequency and functionality from ICP27, VP22 and VP13/14 restricted T cells ex vivo. Additionally for vaccine development, translational experiments using in vitro DC:T cell co-culture experiments would provide a clearer understanding of the immunogenicity and functionality of HLA restricted HSV-2 epitopes.

Briefly, codon optimized cDNA sequences of ICP27, VP22 and VP13/14 were synthesized (GeneArt AG, Regensburg, Germany) and subcloned into pPML7857, pPML7858 and pPML7871 plasmids respectively. Recombinant mRNA expression was confirmed for all vectors by RT-PCR following transfection of CHO cells. Monovalent DNA vaccines for each plasmid were precipitated onto gold beads ranging from 1\u20133 \u03bcm in diameter and filled into cassettes for helium accelerated DNA-gold particle delivery by the single use ND10 device [46]. Each actuation of the ND10 device was formulated to deliver 2 \u03bcg of DNA on 1 mg of gold. BALB/c mice (n = 6) (6\u20138 weeks old) were intradermally immunized with a single actuation from the ND10 device encoding the DNA constructs on gold [23]. All immunization procedures were carried out under the authority of a UK home office project license.",

Experimental validation was performed using the HSV-2 infected mouse model and the results compared with responses elicited by DNA encoded vaccines. Responses were shown by ELISpot generally to be of a higher magnitude in the infection model than in vaccinated animals. These epitopes could be used to monitor peptide specific T cell responses after DNA vaccine delivery with the HSV-2 antigens ICP27, VP22 and VP13/14. It is possible that an optimized vaccination strategy may generate a sufficiently strong and broad response to mimic the responses seen in the infected animals. ",
