The processing of virus proteins into short fragments generates thousands of peptides that might potentially form pMHC-I epitopes, but only a few elicit CTL responses [2].",

            "text": "Virus escape mutants are well documented for persistent infections and constitute a major problem for CD8+ T cell-mediated control and vaccine design [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. With regard to the influenza A viruses, mutational changes driven by CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are unlikely to result in long-term persistence within the individual, as other mechanisms (particularly antibody) can ultimately mediate virus clearance [10]. Even so, the fact that such mutants can be found in nature suggests that influenza virus-specific CTLs are of protective value. Perhaps this reflects that the infection of new subjects favours the selection of mutant viruses that are more slowly controlled (and thus shed for longer), particularly in the face of a seasonal \u201cbottleneck\u201d where much of the population is already immune [11]. In humans, influenza escape variants have been observed for CD8+ T cell epitopes presented in context of several HLAs, including HLA-B8, HLA-B27 and HLA-B35 [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. The immunogenic peptides can be modified at an MHC anchor residue, resulting in defective binding to the MHC-I glycoprotein, or at a TCR contact site. Mutations at TCR contact residues lead to partial (cross-reactive) or total (non-cross-reactive) loss of recognition by wt CD8+ T cells [13], with some variants eliciting epitope-specific CD8+ T cell responses that are both novel and of substantial magnitude [12].",

This raises the possibility that it might be worthwhile to think in terms of vaccinating against likely virus escape mutants. The present analysis focuses on the cross-reactive (to wt DbNP366) CD8+ T cell response to the mutant DbNPN3A epitope [22] formed by substitution of the partially solvent exposed, and non-prominent for TCR binding, residue at position (P) 3 of the influenza NP366\u2013374 peptide [21], [23]. The findings have implications for vaccines to combat virus mutants and tumour escape variants, and suggest that immunisation against likely cross-reactive variants would have to be carefully evaluated to see if the strategy is worthwhile.",

The B6 mice were immunised i.p. with the virulent PR8 mutant and wt viruses, while the HK viruses were used for primary (1o) i.n. infection of na\u00efve mice or secondary (2o) i.n. challenge of PR8-immune (>30d previously) mice. Na\u00efve (primary) or PR8-immune (PR8, or PR8NPN3A) mice were challenged i.n. with the homologous virus (HK, or HKNPN3A) and CD8+ T cell responses were measured using the DbNP366 and DbNPN3A tetramers (Fig 2). It was immediately apparent that the splenic DbNPN3A+CD8+ set elicited by the HKNPN3A challenge was significantly smaller on d10 (p<0.05) than the DbNP366\n+CD8+ T cell response induced by the wt virus (Fig 2B), though there was no significant difference between DbNPN3A+CD8+ and DbNP366\n+CD8+ T cell numbers at the site of infection (BAL, Fig 2A). This has been seen before [24] and suggests that the need to clear virus from the lung results in preferential CTL localization to the site of infection when immune T cell numbers are limited. The profile of a diminished DbNPN3A+CD8+ T cell response was maintained into memory (d28, Fig 1C; p<0.02), supporting the view that the relative size of persistent T cell pools reflects the extent of antigen driven proliferation during the acute anti-viral response.",

Similarly, the total cell numbers for memory DbPA224-specific T cells on d28 were comparable for those primed and boosted within the wt and mutant virus combinations (Fig 2F), while the DbNPN3A+ CD8+ set was 8-fold smaller than the wt DbNP366\n+CD8+ population (p<0.005). Again, the results following secondary challenge support the view that, at least in the earlier (d28) stages of memory, T cell numbers reflect the extent of clonal expansion during the acute phase [26]. In our experiments, we detected DbNP366\n+CD8+ and NPN3A+CD8+ T cells by two techniques, tetramer staining and IFN-\u03b3 ICS.

More of the DbNPN3A+CD8+ T cells remained CD62Lhi when sampled at the peak of the response (d10) following primary challenge (Fig S1A), confirming the impression from the quantitative analysis (Fig 2 A\u2013C) that there may be less clonal expansion. On the other hand, IL-7R expression was comparable for the DbNPN3A+CD8+ and DbNP366\n+CD8+ T cell populations generated in virus-infected na\u00efve mice (Fig S1 CD) with both being (p<0.01) lower than the values for the DbPA224-specific set (Fig S1C). This suggests that IL-7R levels may be antigen dose- rather than magnitude-dependent. Neither of these differential effects was apparent for d28 memory T cells specific for the mutant or wt epitopes (Fig S1BD). Functional analysis of cytokine production based on short term (5h) stimulation with cognate peptide in the ICS assay showed no obvious differences at any stage for the DbNP366 and DbNPN3A-specifc T cells, though the usual divergence [29] from the DbPA224\n+CD8+ T cell response was observed (p<0.01) (Fig S1 E\u2013H). These data suggest that NPN3A mutation leads to cross-reactive, but diminished, CD8+ T cell responses with comparable cytokine production profiles.",

In comparison to the wt NP366 that makes 636 contacts with the H-2Db molecule, the NPN3A peptide achieves only 601 contacts. Interestingly, the Asn3 Ala mutation abolishes contacts between the P3 residue of the peptide with His155 and the Tyr156 of the MHC and eliminates one hydrogen bond between the P3-AsnN\u03b42 and the P4-GluO (Fig. 3CD). The loss of inter-residue bonding between 3N and 4E within the NPN3A peptide may also be important for TCR recognition as it changes the characteristics of the wt DbNP366 epitope (defined as type III constraint) [30] into an unconstrained DbNPN3A epitope. This change of constraint within the epitope could affect the dynamics of the peptide upon TCR ligation, and subsequently alter TCR reactivity toward the mutated epitope. In addition, the loss of contacts with the His155 of the MHC is of interest, as position 155, termed the \u201cgate-keeper residue\u201d [31] is involved in contacting the TCRs in all TCRpMHC-I complexes solved to date [32].

Furthermore, assessing the extent of V\u03b28.3 bias (the dominant V\u03b2 for the DbNP366\n+CD8+ set) within the na\u00efve DbNPN3A+CD8+ population (Fig 4B) showed that the extent of V\u03b28.3 usage (mean 13.2%\u00b14.3) (Fig. 4B) was much the same as that determined previously [33] for na\u00efve DbNP366\n+CD8+ CTLps (mean 17.1%\u00b17.4) However, sequencing the na\u00efve DbNPN3A+V\u03b28.3+CD8+ TCR CDR3\u03b2 regions showed a clear difference from the comparable wt-specific set. The \u201cpublic TCR\u201d dominance characteristic of DbNP366\n+V\u03b28.3+CD8+ T cells in both pre-immune [33] and immune [34] TCR\u03b2 repertoires [34] was not a prominent feature of the DbNPN3A-specific TCR repertoire. These public TCRs were found in only one (SGGANTGQL and SGGGNTGQL) or two (SGGSNTGQL) of the 10 mice tested (Fig. 4C). Thus, although the na\u00efve CTLp frequencies are comparable for DbNP366\n+V\u03b28.3+CD8+ and DbNPN3A+V\u03b28.3+CD8+ T cells and there is some overlap of some cross-reactive TCRs, the two repertoires are far from identical. The roughly equivalent numbers of precursors specific for the wt DbNP366 and mutant NPN3A peptides were unexpected considering the lower response after infection with the mutated virus. The lower magnitude of the NPN3A+CD8+ T cell response and narrower TCR\u03b2 repertoire suggest that only a proportion of na\u00efve NPN3A+CD8+ precursors are being recruited into the immune response or that, once recruited, these cells do not expand efficiently. Inefficient recruitment and/or expansion early after influenza infection, despite large na\u00efve CTL precursor numbers, have been recently documented by our group as key determinants of subdominance for DbPB1-F262 and KbNS2114-specific responses [33].",

Overall, the mutant and the wt immune V\u03b28.3 repertoires appear different. Single-cell RT-PCR and sequencing of the CDR3\u03b2 region of tetramer+V\u03b28.3+CD8+ T cells following either HK or HK-NPN3A infections showed that (Table S1) the mutant DbNPN3A+CD8+ T cells utilized different J\u03b2 regions (primary (10): J\u03b21.1, J\u03b21.3; secondary (20): J\u03b21.1, J\u03b21.6, J\u03b22.2) in comparison to the wt DbNP366\n+CD8+ population (10: J\u03b22.2, J\u03b22.4; 20: J\u03b2 2.2), and showed evidence of more variable CDR3\u03b2 loop lengths (8\u20139 aa).

This likely reflects that the N3A mutation has disrupted an \u201coptimal\u201d TCR/pMHC fit that maximizes antigen-driven clonal expansion. Indeed, the public TCRs were not a prominent feature of the DbNPN3A+CD8+ set, being found in only 4 of the 7 NPN3A-infected mice at a very low frequency, namely 0% in the 10 response and 22.9% in the 20 response (Table 2).

Even so, the clonotypic diversity within individual NPN3A virus-infected mice was reduced compared to the spectrum found following wt virus-infection. This was true whether the cells were sorted using the wt DbNP366 or the mutant DbNPN3A tetramer, reflecting the significant cross-reactivity between the DbNP366 and DbNPN3A-specific populations recovered from mice infected with the NPN3A viruses. By the measure of tetramer binding, it thus seems that the NPN3A virus is selecting a less diverse repertoire than the wt virus, with the repertoire being almost completely cross-reactive with that elicited by the wt DbNP366 epitope.",

Interestingly, clonotypes like KGGSNTGQL were enriched by the DbNPN3A tetramer in some but not other mice (Table 3; present in M9 but not M12) suggesting, again, the likely importance of V\u03b2-V\u03b1 chain pairing for recognition of the native DbNP366\n+CD8+ T cells with the mutant DbNPN3A tetramer.

Mice that were primed with the PR8NPN3A and then challenged with either the wt HK or mutant HKNPN3A viruses showed equivalent recall of DbNPN3A+CD8+ T cells during the acute phase of the secondary response. This was detected by IFN-\u03b3 production (Fig 5A) and tetramer staining (data not shown) and is consistent with the TCR CDR3\u03b2 analysis (Table 2). Conversely, when mice were firstly primed with wt PR8, then later infected i.n. with either the wt HK or mutant HK-NPN3A, the DbNP366\n+CD8+ T cells were differentially recalled indicating that (in the absence of primary selection from the na\u00efve repertoire by the mutant epitope) only some of the DbNP366\n+CD8+ memory T cells that were expanded by heterologous challenge bind DbNPN3A (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, wt priming and challenge (10 PR8->20 X31) resulted in significantly higher CD8+ T cells numbers (Fig. 5B) than were found for any secondary CD8+ T cell responses after NPN3A priming (10 PR8-NPN3A->20 X31-NPN3A and 10 PR8-NPN3A->20 X31). These results lead to two main conclusions: (i) priming with the wt virus elicits CD8+ T cells that respond relatively well to a subsequent infection with cross-reactive variant (ie 10 PR8->20 X31-NPN3A = 10 PR8-NPN3A->20 X31-NPN3A); (ii) priming with the cross-reactive variant can be detrimental as the diminished primary response may limit the full expansion of CD8+ T cells that are able to respond to the subsequent wt infection (ie 10 PR8-NPN3A->20 X31 is lower than 10 PR8->20 X31) and skew the TCR usage.

We performed prime-and-challenge studies in \u03bcMT mice lacking B cells to ensure that antibody responses did not mask any possible inhibitory effects of \u201csuboptimal\u201d TCRs on viral clearance. As suggested by CD8+ T cell data, assessment of lung viral titres showed delayed viral clearance on d6 after the secondary infection in case of heterologous prime-and-boost (PR8->X31-NPN3A and PR8-NPN3A->X31) compared to homologous infections (PR8->X31 or PR8-NPN3A->X31-NPN3A) (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that recall of \u201csuboptimal\u201d TCRs for a single T cell specificity can lead to delayed viral clearance, despite the presence of other influenza CD8+ T cell responses (DbPA224\n+CD8+, DbPB162\n+CD8+, KbNS1114\n+CD8+, KbPB1703\n+CD8+).",

Thus, while the immune repertoire selected by DbNP3A shows evidence of equivalent avidity following stimulation with the NPN3A or NP366 peptides, DbNP366 induces a response that is of higher avidity for the wt than the mutant epitope. The same effect was seen even more clearly when three (all expressing the SGGGNTGQL CDR3\u03b2) T cell hybridoma lines [37] specific for DbNP366 were stimulated with the two peptides (Fig 6DE). This result is in accord with findings from both the TCR repertoire analysis of cross-reactive clonotypes, assessed by tetramer binding (Table 2), and the response magnitudes determined following homologous and heterologous virus challenge (Fig 5). Thus, priming and recall of cross-reactive CD8+ T cells recognising mutant viral epitopes reflects functional (defined as responsiveness to a peptide) pMHC-TCR avidity.",

The NPN3A mutation leads to both decreased recruitment of CD8+ T cells and a narrowed clonotype selection profile within V\u03b28.3 and V\u03b29 regions. Structurally, the mutation leads to a loss of a number of contacts between the NPN3A peptide and the MHC-I molecule, including a contact with the gate-keeper residue at position 155, and unaltered stability of the H-2Db-NPN3A complex. The fact that the NPN3A mutation affects contacts with the MHC-I at His155, known to play an important role in TCR-pMHC structures in general, is likely to indirectly compromise the TCR recognition. By loosing the bond with the Asn3, His155 may gain more flexibility and thus be inappropriately placed for the subsequent TCR ligation onto the NPN3A peptide. Alternatively, it is also possible that a small part of the solvent-exposed head group of the Asn3 residue in the wt NP366 peptide might, to some extent, be directly interacting with the TCR following ligation.",

These findings suggest that a very limited spectrum of CD8+ T cells can recognise the DbNPN3A mutant structure. Interestingly, a similar P3 substitution in the influenza virus DbPA224 epitope had no affect on DbPA224\n+CD8+ T cell recognition and recruited a diverse array of TCR clones comparable to the spectrum found for the wt response [21]. This suggests that the partially-exposed P3 residue plays a greater structural and/or TCR recognition role for the \u201cfeatureless\u201d DbNP366 than for the \u201cfeatured\u201d DbPA224 complex reflecting, in turn, the more limited spectrum of TCRs that bind DbNP366\n[21].

These public clonotypes are not a prominent feature of the DbNPN3A+CD8+ set, being found only in 4/7 NPN3A-infected mice at very low frequency. Since we know that these TCR clonotypes are present in all B6 mice [34], the difference presumably reflects the lower TCR avidity for DbNPN3A, as indicated by the T cell hybridoma analysis where they were shown to require 1000 times more NPN3A than NP366 peptide for optimal stimulation. Since the public clonotypes cannot be efficiently recruited into the immune response by the mutated N3A virus, this could have created a \u201chole\u201d in TCRs capable of recognising the mutated epitope, which subsequently can lead to a reduction in T cell immunogenicity [43]. However, though both the DbNP366\n+CD8+ and DbNPN3A+CD8+ T cell responses are characterised by quite distinct TCR repertoires, the majority are bound by both the DbNP366 and DbNPN3A tetramers and can be detected by stimulation with either the NP366 or the NPN3A peptides, suggesting that a clonal dissection of TCR clonotypes is needed to make a valid interpretation about the truly cross-reactive CD8+ T cell responses.

On the other hand, changes like the non-cross-reactive NP-M6A mutation [22] that induce a completely novel, high quality response might merit incorporation in an experimental vaccine or immunotherapy strategy. Overall, working out the topographical constraints that determine these differential response profiles would seem eminently worthwhile.",

Recombinant PCR products encoding N3A366 were digested with BsmB1 and ligated into the alkaline phosphatase treated pHW2000 vector.

Viruses were then amplified in the allantoic cavity of 10-day old embryonated chicken eggs, and the viral titre determined by plaque assay of allantoic fluid infecting monolayers of MDCK cells. There was any evidence of altered fitness in vivo for the HKNPN3A virus, as the kinetics of virus growth and clearance following i.n. challenge of na\u00efve B6 mice were found to be equivalent for the wt HK and mutant viruses (Fig S3A). Similarly, the levels of CTL activity found using target cells infected with HKNPN3A or the HK wt viruses were comparable, and the same was seen for peptide pulsed cells, suggesting that antigen presentation of NPN3A peptide remains constant (Fig S3 BC).",

The search probe used to solve the structure was the structure of mouse MHC class I H2-Db minus the peptide (Protein Data Bank accession number 3CPL) [22]. The progress of refinement was monitored by the Rfree value with neither a sigma nor a low-resolution cutoff being applied to the data.
