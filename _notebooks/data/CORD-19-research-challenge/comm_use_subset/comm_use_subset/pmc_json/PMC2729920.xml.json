            "text": "When an emerging influenza virus appears in humans, an early concern is whether the virus has the potential to cause a devastating pandemic, i.e., the global spread of an infection killing a substantial number of people. To assess the pandemic potential, two critical aspects need to be studied: the transmission potential and the clinical severity of the infection [1]\u2013[3]. It is widely known in epidemiology that the former aspect, the transmission potential, can be quantified by the reproduction number, i.e., the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case [1], [4], by characterizing the heterogeneous patterns of transmission (e.g. age-specificity) [5], and by measuring other epidemiological quantities such as household secondary attack rate. There are two different approaches to assessing the latter aspect of a pandemic, the virulence of infection. One is to explore specific genetic markers of the virus that are known to be associated with severe influenza (e.g. the PB1 gene) [6], although the absence of a known marker, as was for example the case in a novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV), does not necessarily indicate that the virus is benign [7]. Another is an epidemiological approach to quantification of the case fatality ratio (CFR), the conditional probability of death given infection (or disease; see below).",

Because in the early phase of an outbreak information is often limited to confirmed cases, we concentrate on confirmed cases only, and refer to the CFR as the confirmed CFR (cCFR) for clarity. As the world has experienced a global spread of S-OIV since April 2009, methods have been sought for the real-time assessment of virulence by measuring the cCFR which is a representative of the epidemiological measurements of virulence [2], [3]. Nevertheless, a much-used crude estimate of the cCFR, i.e. the ratio of the cumulative number of deaths to cases at calendar time t, tends to yield a biased (and mostly underestimated) cCFR due to the time-delay from onset to death [8]; similar estimates of such a biased cCFR for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have shown how such estimates can vary substantially as an epidemic progresses, stabilizing only in the later stages of the outbreak [8], [9]. In the following we will use the terms biased and unbiased cCFR when we refer to this particular source of bias.",

            "text": "Improving an early epidemiological assessment of an unbiased cCFR is therefore crucial for the initial determination of virulence, shaping the level and choices of public health intervention, and providing advice to the general public [10]. To obtain an estimate of the cCFR, the lesson from the SARS outbreak is that a statistical technique is required that corrects the underestimation, e.g. a technique addressing censoring [8], [11], [12]. Nevertheless, in the case of novel S-OIV, an early unbiased estimation of the cCFR has appeared particularly challenging. Initial reports from the government of Mexico suggested a virulent infection, whereas in other countries the same virus was perceived as mild [13]. In the USA and Canada there were no deaths attributed to the virus in the first 10 days following a declaration of a public health emergency by the World Health Organization. Even under similar circumstances at the early stage of the global pandemic, public health officials, policy makers and the general public want to know the virulence of an emerging infectious agent. That is, a simple method for assessing cCFR is called for, even when only a few deaths have been reported, or even when there has been no report of deaths. Except for another unbiased cCFR estimate in Mexico (0.4%, range 0.3\u20131.5%) [1], this early assessment has been missing. In the USA, a technical discussion has taken place on the crude measurement of the biased cCFR using the cumulative numbers of deaths and confirmed cases so far [10].",

The present study aims at developing a simple method to assess the virulence of an emerging influenza virus at the early stage of the epidemic, even when there have been only a few deaths or none at all. The method takes into account the time from the onset of symptoms to death, while differing from previously published statistical methods which employ censoring techniques [8], [11]. As an example, we give an early prediction of the cCFR of S-OIV infection in the USA and Canada, and show that the unbiased cCFR, as estimated by our method at the early stage of the epidemic in these countries, was in fact comparable to that estimated for Mexico [1]. Our unbiased estimation of the cCFR does not address all sources of error in data (e.g. underdiagnosis of infected individuals) and we summarize the relevant issues in the discussion.",

Accordingly, an unbiased estimator of cCFR would be the proportion of deaths among confirmed cases at the end of an epidemic.

First, b\nt, a crude and biased estimate of cCFR, calculated at time t, is given by the ratio of the cumulative number of deaths D\nt to the cumulative number of confirmed cases C\nt:(1)During the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002\u201303, it was shown that this estimator, b\nt, considerably underestimates the cCFR [8]. This is easily demonstrated by relating C\nt and D\nt to the incidence function c\nt (i.e. the number of new confirmed cases on day t), and the conditional probability density function f\ns of the time from onset to death, given death. First, C\nt is the cumulative number of confirmed cases up to time t:(2)Second, D\nt is the cumulative number of deaths up to time t:(3)As we mentioned above, p\nt is the realized proportion of confirmed cases to die from the infection, and is a random variable, which would be an unbiased estimator for \u03c0. Therefore, b\nt can be rewritten as(4)As can be observed in equation (4), the estimator b\nt is smaller than the realized p\nt, because the time delay from onset to death, expressed in the double summation in the numerator, results in the numerator being smaller than the denominator (note that f\ns is a probability distribution). Therefore we refer to b\nt as the biased estimator of the cCFR: it gives a biased estimate, calculated on day t, of the cCFR [8], [11]. When we observe the entire course of an epidemic (i.e. t\u2192\u221e), b\nt tends to p\nt and becomes an unbiased estimator. The aim is to obtain an unbiased estimator \u201cwell before\u201d observing the entire course of the outbreak.",

This is a sample from a binomial distribution with sample size u\nt\nC\nt and probability \u03c0:(7)An alternative way of deriving this probability is by first considering the total number, y, of people in the sample C\nt that will ultimately die from infection, which is binomially distributed with sample size n = C\nt and probability \u03c0. However, because of the time delay from onset to death, we do not observe this outcome by time t: only for a proportion u\nt is the outcome observed. Hence our observation is a hypergeometric sample from a population of size C\nt, with sample size u\nt\nC\nt, and number of deaths y\n[15], [16]:(8)which is equivalent to equation (7).

First, we examine a simplified version of our method by using only deaths and cases from an early stage of the SARS epidemic, and compare our estimate against the eventual stable estimate at the end of the epidemic. For simplicity, we employ an exponential distribution for the distribution of the time from onset to death, F(s), with a mean of 35.9 days [11], and f\ns is subsequently calculated as the daily increase in F(s), i.e., f\ns = F(s)\u2212F(s\u22121). Second, we use the most recent published datasets of S-OIV epidemics in which the dates of illness onset for confirmed cases are known [17], [18]. The latest such reports for the USA and Canada were at May 1 and June 10, 2009, respectively. In the USA, there were 399 confirmed cases by May 1, with 394 known dates of onset (Figure 2A). Among 399 confirmed cases, 2 cases resulted in death by May 1. In Canada, there were 2978 confirmed cases, with 2004 known dates of onset by June 10, among which 4 cases died by June 10 (Figure 2B). The biased cCFR estimates, b\nt in these countries were 0.50% ( = 2/399) and 0.13% ( = 4/2978), respectively. The six deaths are insufficient to determine the distribution of time from onset to death for these countries. We therefore employ a gamma distribution for F(s) (to calculate f\ns), with reference to historical data for H1N1 [19], with a mean length of 9 days and a variance of 39.7 days2 (coefficient of variation 70%, shape parameter 2.04) [20]. To address the uncertainty, we examine the sensitivity of our unbiased cCFR estimate to different means (6\u201314 days) and variances (9\u2013159 days2).

Because sampling a finite number of cases during the course of an outbreak cannot prove that infection never results in death, a more useful result would be the maximum cCFR with a certain level of confidence if no deaths are observed after C\nt cases. To obtain this result, we rearrange equation (11) to obtain(12)where p\nmax is the maximum cCFR given C\nt cases and no deaths, at a confidence level of 1-\u03b1, e.g. 95% if \u03b1 = 0.05.

Our results show that the few observations of death in the USA and Canada give us no reason to believe that the unbiased cCFR, and therefore the virulence of the novel pandemic strain, is smaller in the USA and Canada than in Mexico. Nevertheless, given that the CFR of seasonal influenza is equal to or less than 0.1% [10], our estimates (with the lower bound of cCFR close to the 0.1%) do not offer conclusive results to indicate that the S-OIV is more virulent than seasonal influenza, but do point in that direction.",

In the present study, we estimated the cCFR as the proportion of deaths among confirmed cases. This definition was chosen, because of our aim to use the minimally available data, and so we were not able to estimate the proportion of deaths among all symptomatic cases, and not able to estimate the proportion of deaths among all those infected (symptomatic and asymptomatic). The issue of defining the correct denominator population can never be completely resolved, but it is essential to realize how the obtained estimate relates to other situations [8]. By only using confirmed cases, it is clear that all cases will be missed that do not seek medical treatment or are not notified, as well as all cases that are asymptomatic. This means that our cCFR estimate is higher than the proportion of deaths among infecteds, and may be considered an overestimate. However, when relating our estimate to previous pandemics, it should also be realized that the current pandemic is the first where many confirmatory diagnoses of influenza have been recorded using RT-PCR techniques, allowing improved precision of cCFR estimates over those for previous influenza epidemics. Whereas the use of RT-PCR in the current pandemic may yield a smaller denominator (and thus an overestimate of CFR compared to previous pandemics), other pandemics could have involved substantial numbers of false-positive cases in the denominator.

Note that the estimates in Figure 6C are different from our b\nt due to unavailability of the date of onset, although they give an approximate indication of the time-course of the biased cCFR. It is striking to see that the biased cCFR during the very early stage (i.e. from late April to mid-May) showed a declining trend following a single spike. The biased cCFR estimates at later time points show a slight increase as a function of time, which is consistent with our knowledge of underestimation of the cCFR [8]. The early spike may be explained by a time-varying coverage of confirmed diagnoses which could have increased as a function of time (i.e. cases in the very beginning of the epidemic were less likely to be confirmed). Other plausible explanations include (1) demographic stochasticity, (2) effective treatment, and (3) heterogeneous risk of death among subpopulations. As for (1), because the number of deaths in the USA and Canada was very small during the early stage, the spike may reflect (unpredictable) probabilistic variations in the number of deaths among a small number of confirmed cases. If that is the case, our unbiased cCFR estimate for the USA (with data until May 1) may be too high, not because of a systematic bias but just by chance. In relation to factor (2), it is plausible that cases diagnosed in later stages of the epidemic receive treatment at an early stage of illness (or even before symptom onset). With respect to (3), the risk of dying is likely to be different for different subpopulations [8], [10], [22], [23]. It should be noted that the composition of sub-populations (e.g. age-groups and those with a specific underlying disease) is likely to vary as a function of time, and a cCFR estimate for the entire population, such as ours, is influenced by this variation. These points need to be addressed in future studies.",

First, rather than updating the data based on date of reporting, it is critically important to summarize the data according to the date of onset both at local and global levels. Knowing the date of symptom onset is a key to applying our proposed estimation framework to empirical observation. Second, epidemiological data should be updated in a precise reporting interval at least during the early stage of an epidemic (so that the data permit estimation of the unbiased cCFR). Given that mean time from onset to death is around 9 days, weekly data do not enable us to make our explicit adjustment. Optimal reporting for the early cCFR estimation may be incorporated into official pandemic response plans. Moreover, in addition to using death as an outcome of virulence, the usefulness of other epidemiological measurements of severe manifestation (e.g. the number of admissions to intensive care unit) needs to be explored.",

We have shown that underestimation can be adjusted in a very simple manner, and our approach enabled us to obtain an unbiased cCFR estimate by only minimizing a binomial deviance. These methods are particularly useful when there have been only a few deaths or even no death at all by time t during the course of an epidemic. Uncertainties surrounding the unbiased estimate of cCFR based on a few deaths can partly be addressed by sensitivity analysis of the estimate to different lengths of time from onset to death. An observation of zero deaths in a given country (or a specific setting) should not be deemed a signature of a \u201cbenign\u201d virus without observing a substantial number of cases. We have shown that a conservative upper bound of cCFR is a more useful interpretation of the observed number of cases without death. In this way, given that we have some prior knowledge or a few observations of death which permit us to assume F(s) is known, epidemiologists and biostatisticians in each country or locality can directly apply our method to assess the virulence of an infection at the early stage of any emerging infectious disease.",
