This serious epidemic created the biggest social fear in Korea. The first MERS case was identified on 20 May 2015; a 68-year-old man returning from the Middle East was diagnosed with MERS. It passed nine days after he had sought medical care. Figure 1 shows repaid spread of MERS. In Figure 1, the X axis represents the timeline. The patient with MERS was first confirmed on 20 May 2015. The Y axis presents the number of deaths (black line), the number of confirmed cases with MERS (dark blue dotted line), and the number of quarantined cases (light yellow dotted line). The number of quarantined individuals peaked on 17 June, with 6729 individuals. The number of death caused by MERS peaked on 25 October, with 37 cases. On 7 June, 23 persons were confirmed with MERS.",

            "text": "Risk perception toward a specific object or event may be based not only on objective or physical factors, e.g., large number of deaths, but also on subjective or constructive ones, e.g., the perceived risk from the death of one beloved person. Therefore, risk judgment is considered to be a social phenomenon. In terms of subjective views, the psychometric paradigm in risk studies suggests that lack of control, high catastrophic potential, and severe consequences account for increased risk perception and anxiety associated with dread risks [2]. With reference to MERS, Yang and Cho [3] argued that the MERS outbreak in Korea was exacerbated by inappropriate responses by major institutions. They explained that the Korean government did not deliver timely information about the status of the epidemic, hospitals\u2019 names, and response procedures related to MERS. In particular, not disclosing the information of hospitals that accommodated patients with MERS brought about unnecessary anxiety and fear among the public. Instead of the government, the Pressian, a press media organization, was the first to announce the list of hospitals accommodating MERS patients. Under such circumstances of limited information, individuals tend to depend on rumors or informal information. In particular, the public obtained inaccurate information from social media and the internet. Such unfiltered information increased the level of perceived risk of MERS, all of which amplified the dread related to this disease. Unfiltered information is closely related to rumors. Rumors amplify the perceived risk. For example, according to Jacob et al. [4], rumors related to the Fukushima nuclear accident rapidly spread across the country border, and, once spread, they exacerbated the disaster situation. In the case of MERS, rumors such as \u201cSeveral cases were confirmed at hospitals in Suwon and Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, and the disease has been already transmitted to a number of individuals there\u201d, \u201cForeign media reports that Korea is under disaster, saying MERS will become a more serious epidemic than Ebola or SARS\u201d, were spread [5]. However, these rumors were not true. The lack of credible information is often filled by rumors.",

Their study tested the psychological impact of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus (MERS-CoV) outbreaks on emergency room resident physicians (ERRPs). Among the ERRP survey respondents, majority (91%) agreed that their work put them at risk of infection. A total of 54% of ERRPs reported being afraid of contracting the infection from infected patients. Further, a majority of the ERRPs (85%) felt that their job would expose their families to risk of infection [6]. Lee et al. [7] investigated relationships between community residents\u2019 infection sensitivity and their levels of preventive behaviors during the 2015 MERS outbreak in Korea. They demonstrated that the group with overall high sensitivity exhibited higher scores on stress levels, reliability on preventive behaviors, practice of preventive behaviors, and practice of hand washing during the outbreak period, as compared to the non-sensitive group.",

They reported that a buzz of negative emotions (i.e., anxiety or fear) was more prevalent in online discussion boards, on Twitter, and in online cafes, rather than on news sites and blogs. Additionally, news buzz, but not rumor buzz, was associated with positive MERS emotions (i.e., being calm or composed). Similarly, after examining the sources of confusion during the MERS outbreak, Yang and Cho [3] reported that media content affected the public\u2019s perception of MERS risk, and that this perception of a high level of risk affected the public\u2019s reactions. Choi et al. [10] focused on the role of the media in shaping the public\u2019s perceived risk of MERS. Based on online panel survey data during the MERS outbreak, they found that social media exposure was positively related to the formation of risk perceptions.",

Moreover, there was a positive correlation between knowledge, risk perception, and health behaviors. Additionally, knowledge and risk perception explained 15.1% of the variance in health behaviors, indicating that higher knowledge and higher risk perception were associated with higher protective behavior. With a more integrated causal model, Kim and Song [11] examined the causal relationships among risk characteristics, trust, risk perception, and preventive behavioral intention during the MERS risk/crisis situation. They found that risk characteristics were positively associated with risk perception. Moreover, trust was negatively associated with risk perception, but positively related to preventive behavioral intention.",

In particular, egalitarianism was correlated with a higher perception of risk. Moreover, Kim and Kim [18] showed that egalitarian social groups displayed higher perceived risk regarding a newly-developed information system, whereas individualistic groups revealed lower risk perceptions in this regard. Based on a meta-analysis, Xue et al.

Moreover, according to Marris et al.

[25] proposed that nine risk characteristics influence perceived and acceptable risk. Among them, two characteristics, i.e., known to the science, and controllability, are critical factors in risk judgment. Thus, if individuals feel that they do not precisely understand the risk object or if they do not fully believe in its controllability, they exhibit higher risk perception and less acceptance. Considering this logic, science and technology are a means for acquiring precise knowledge and for controlling an unknown risk. This acquisition of precise knowledge and improved controllability of risk usually reduces the uncertainty that increases risk perception. According to Siegrist et al. [26], the general confidence that everything is under control negatively influences risk perception. In this vein, positive belief in science and technology might negatively influence the perceived risk of MERS. Moreover, trust in science and scientists, i.e., an alternative version of optimism, has an impact on risk perception. For example, according to Hmielowski et al. [27], trust in scientists is an important instrument that many individuals use when reporting their opinions on science-related topics; the higher the trust, the lower the perceived risk. Considering these findings, we propose the following hypothesis:",

Mayor Park publicly blamed the central government\u2019s failure to filter suspected MERS patients and for hiding important information that could have been useful for the public and municipalities. President Park, however, criticized the mayor, saying that the Seoul Mayor\u2019s independent actions could lead to confusion among the public. The conservative ruling party accused the mayor of spreading false rumors [30]. Such political conflicts started just not from the MERS case. The Sewol ferry disaster that occurred 2014 and killed more than 300 individuals revealed similar ideological conflicts, as like MERS case. According to Jin and Song [31], the disaster response in the case of the Sewol ferry disaster was unsuccessful because the Korea Coast Guard (KCG) was more concerned about hierarchical, political, and legal accountability than about professional accountability during the accident.",

Disaster resilience is the ability of individuals, communities, organizations, and states to adapt to and recover from hazards, shocks, or stresses without compromising long-term prospects for development [39]. In the present study, we focused on the subjective resilience that individuals constructed. According to the Hyogo Framework for Action [39], those who strongly believe in their own resilience tend to exhibit less risk perception because they have a great deal of confidence in being able to recover from a byproduct of a hazard afterward.

In terms of actor-centered approaches, Yang and Tang [50] identified the following 3 types of trust: trust in administrative institution, trust in legal institution, and trust in societal institution. Second, the concept of trust depends on the level of trust, i.e., individual versus institutional trust. Rousseau et al. [51] defined individual trust as \u201ca psychological state comprising the intention to accept vulnerability based upon positive expectations of the intentions or behavior of another\u201d (p. 395). In the other hand, Moy and Pfau [52] defined institutional trust as the positive orientation toward a political system. Third, characteristics of trust are one of the standards to distinguish various forms of trust. In this regard, Rousseau et al. [51] suggested two types of trust, relational and calculative. While the former refers to the relationship between the trusting person and the other, the latter pertains to the past behavior of the other and/or constraints on future behavior.",

In such a situation, with no information and knowledge, distrust plays a critical role in risk judgment.",

It is generally observed that more knowledge generally reduces perceived risk. However, in MERS, knowledge was found to amplify perceived risk. Thus, it infers that the effect of knowledge seems to vary according to the context. Therefore, better knowledge management strategies need to be implemented. This critical role of knowledge suggests that the government and other actors should mobilize risk communication during an epidemic to provide appropriate and precise information. In this regard, Yang and Cho [3] reported that risk perception was associated with the information delivered by the media. Therefore, providing accurate information and data to the public will be important in managing future crises. Song et al. [9] suggested that, in the case of a breakout of a novel and highly contagious disease such as MERS, the government must deploy a response system that includes the provision and dissemination of reliable information and inhibits the online diffusion of false information. Thus, to ensure appropriate knowledge management, disease control authorities should develop an effective method of retrieving, sharing, and storing information related to the disease.",

In the resource factor, maintaining a good health contributed to reducing perceived risk, whereas more knowledge amplified the perceived risk of MERS. The value factor did not explain the risk perception. Additionally, among the variables examined in the present studies, trust explained the largest proportion of the variance in perceived risk, followed by perceived health state, knowledge, and vulnerability. Our findings suggest that, with reference to infectious diseases, perception and resource are key factors that determine risk perception. Moreover, the perception factor is more important than the resource one.",

This finding suggests that trust management by the government or other agencies is important in decreasing the perceived risk of an infectious disease. To increase the trust of individuals, the government needs to pay attention to effective communication with the public. According to the WHO outbreak communication guidelines, the following five key points need to be focused on during outbreak communication: (1) build, maintain, or restore trust; (2) announce early; (3) be transparent; (4) understand the public; and (5) incorporate risk communication into preparedness planning. When emerging infectious diseases break out, it is important to mobilize the media to make effective risk communication and to ensure public safety [56]. Likewise, on examining the MERS outbreak in Korea, Lee [57] suggested that we need several categories of successful crisis management communication, such as rapidness, consistency, openness, existence of control tower, and use of a manual. These suggestions stress on the role of effective communication strategies by the government.",

In the future, more empirical studies are needed to verify our findings. Moreover, four cultural types should be included in the theoretical model. However, we did not include hierarchism and fatalism in our research model because of the low level of reliability of the measures for these two cultural biases. However, considering that these two cultural types might be related with the public\u2019s health-related perceptions (e.g., Kahan et al. [58] 2010; Song [59]; Song et al.
