In Costa Rica, a study of 417 children and 503 participants of a childhood asthma management program highlighted the role of IL10 in allergy and asthma exacerbations (when exposed to dust mites). Using a family-based approach to test for associations, the results showed that exposure to house dust mite allergens led to significant differences in the IL10 gene [43].",

After this correction, only IL10 at position \u2212592 for D. farinae and IL4 at position \u2212590 for D. pteronyssinus remained significant. These findings may suggest that different causative agents may be regulated by different cytokine production pathways, and that both cytokines have a biological role in controlling the production of different classes of antibodies. We believe that these data will add useful evidence to this line of research.",
