            "text": "The accurate mathematical modelling of infectious disease outbreaks is important as a tool to understand and predict epidemic dynamics and evaluate the effectiveness of intervention strategies. In the context of directly transmitted pathogens, this ability relies, in part, on an understanding of the contact patterns between the individuals (hosts) of a population. Traditional epidemiological modelling accounts for contact behaviour through both implicit and explicit mechanisms and at different levels of abstraction. Purely compartmental models are used to model subsets of populations of individuals and allow different parameters to govern the rates of interaction between each. This approach has been successfully applied in capturing some of the heterogeneity inherent in contact patterns between groups of hosts. Contact network models, by contrast, explicitly define potential disease-transmitting connections between all individuals in a population, allowing for the incorporation of heterogeneous mixing at the lowest level. Contact networks represent individuals as network nodes and represent potentially disease-transmitting contact between individuals as network edges. The total number of edges connecting an individual with others is referred to as the individual's degree. The probability distribution of these degrees for all individuals in a network (i.e. population) is referred to as the network's degree distribution. The contact heterogeneity in a population is thus reflected in the variance of the network's degree distribution. Gaining an understanding of a host population's distribution of contacts provides structural information useful in characterizing and intervening in disease outbreaks, and has been demonstrated in numerous human, wildlife and livestock disease systems (e.g. [1\u201310]).",

Typically, these data are used to parametrize probabilistic contact network models. These models can then be used as the basis for predictive or public health intervention studies. While an understanding is beginning to emerge of which network structures are relevant for different classes of infectious disease, it is far from clear how to choose among different models of contact heterogeneity. That is, the probabilistic approach assumes a certain model a priori that may or may not be relevant to the disease of interest. (Alternatives to this paradigm do exist; notably, synthetic network models that use census and other socio-demographic data to infer possible contact networks using a first-principles approach [5,13].)",

A key benefit to this approach is that, in addition to providing information on which contact network model likely produced the observed data, the likelihood of alternative models can be evaluated to see how justifiable that choice is in relation to those alternatives. Previous work using a statistical approach has been carried out, where population structure is inferred using a broad range of data from infection/recovery times [14\u201317] to viral molecular sequence data [18,19]. However, much of this inferential work is specific to certain disease systems, is based on severe assumptions about the underlying contact structure or requires significant amounts of outbreak data [12].

By using data that are commonly available for a variety of different disease systems, our approach seeks to make optimal use of collected data and inform future collection efforts. We evaluate three classes of network models that can be broadly classified by their increasing level of contact heterogeneity, looking specifically at whether it is possible to distinguish between these types using high-level and common epidemiological summary statistics. In this way, we are not so much attempting to pin down an exact network, but instead looking to determine what level of heterogeneity the data support, and which individual epidemiological metrics provide the most confidence towards this support. We test our inferential framework with synthetic and empirical contact data, comparing model selection results for each individual epidemiological measure with ground truth (i.e. the network class that generated it). We also evaluate our framework on empirical epidemiological data from historical and recent outbreaks, where the underlying contact structure is unknown, to demonstrate how our framework could be applied in practice and used to gather insights about the relevance of certain contact structures for general classes of infectious disease. In doing so, we determine that only certain epidemiological statistics are informative and consistent in recovering the level of contact heterogeneity in an underlying host population.",

Sensitivity indicates the proportion of positives for which the true network class is inferred as most likely (true positive rate), while specificity indicates the proportion of negatives for which the network classes that are not true are not inferred as most likely (true negative rate; more information is provided in the electronic supplementary material). Together, these two ratios present a picture of how reliable each measure is at classifying the networks. The results shown in figure 1 highlight that overall the classifiers perform well, with only R0 having a trade-off between specificity and sensitivity, and tending to be more specific than sensitive. Epidemic final size, peak size and duration, on the other hand, tend to balance both high specificity and sensitivity (for most transmission probabilities). While peak size and duration perform better as transmissibility decreases, final size classifies more effectively for increasing transmissibility values.

Predictions based on R0 are reliable for the most heterogeneous (scale-free) networks (albeit with large variances) across transmission probabilities, but are largely ambiguous for Poisson and exponentially distributed networks. Classifications based on \u03c1 and \u03b4 become less effective for higher T values; that is, sufficiently transmissible pathogens propagate through all population types efficiently, leading to similar-sized epidemic peaks and durations. Contact heterogeneity based on \u03c3, final size, is most consistent across T values and thus is appropriate to use when transmissibility is not well known a priori. Although the certainty in classification decreases for moderate values of T (0.15\u20130.25) (see the electronic supplementary material, figure S4, for comparison of final size distributions), the classification is still strong. The \u03c3-classifier also remains most effective (for all T values) for populations with smaller (<2) or larger mean degrees, or for smaller population sizes (see sensitivity analysis in the electronic supplementary material).

It is inferred by our model selection as Poisson based on the final size (\u03c3) and peak size (\u03c1) classifiers, but as exponential by the duration (\u03b4) classifier. This result confirms our sensitivity analysis that all classifiers for networks of mean degree two, for small population sizes, are relatively ambiguous for the transmission probability used here (see sensitivity analysis in the electronic supplementary material). For the cattle movement network (figure 3b), a scale-free network is selected strongly by statistical fitting, and both the \u03c3 and \u03c1 classifiers strongly prefer the same. The \u03b4 classifier provides significant evidence for the exponential network, reflecting the disassortative nature of this network [39]. For the school network (figure 3c), the Poisson degree distribution is supported by both our model selection and by the K\u2013L divergence best fit. The \u03b4 classifier does provide weaker support, due to the small population size (see sensitivity analysis in the electronic supplementary material). Lastly, the epidemiological data produced over the urban network (figure 3d) strongly match the K\u2013L divergence best fit of a Poisson degree distribution. The true degree distribution of this empirical network looks to be more complex than any of the three network classes, but its dominant feature, a dispersed peak with a moderate average degree, is most consistent with a Poisson distribution. In addition, the network is strongly modular and moderately assortative (see the electronic supplementary material), but still acts like a Poisson-distributed random network with respect to epidemic outcomes.",

Epidemic duration, although effective when population size and mean degree are small, is not strongly reliable otherwise (see the electronic supplementary material, figure S7). These results demonstrate that although each of these networks has complex network structure (clustering, assortativity, modularity), a classification framework based on the assumption of randomness still predicts the contact heterogeneity as reflected in the degree distribution well. However, they also suggest that network features (such as significant disassortativity) that are a result of more than the degree distribution are not captured by these epidemic measures (especially duration).

The choice of Poisson is reasonable in that it has the lowest contact heterogeneity of the three contact network models and measles has been relatively well modelled in the past using a homogeneous-mixing model [40,41]. The scale-free network model also has relatively high posterior probabilities at lower mean degree values. The most likely explanation for this result is that the mean degree among children less than the age of 14 in Hagelloch was in fact greater than 23 (where the Poisson model is the only likely model). This hypothesis is not unreasonable as the school class sizes in Hagelloch varied from 30 to 90 children. (However, this result is at odds with the results of Groendyke et al. [15,42] who predict an average degree of 8\u201312.)",

Empirical evidences suggest that gonorrhea has a transmission probability lower than 0.55 due to characteristics of the bacterium itself [43,44]. Research also suggests that the scale-free model is a reasonable prediction in this case, as degree distributions of human sexual contact networks have been shown to exhibit high levels of contact heterogeneity and are characterized by a core group of highly active individuals that tend to bridge more isolated individuals [45\u201348].",

Norovirus typically spreads very quickly in a population, usually by person-to-person contact by means of faecal\u2013oral or aerosol transmission [37]. Multiple factors mediate norovirus transmission such as host movement and environmental contamination and thus what constitutes a potentially disease-transmitting contact is vague. It is unclear in this study which factor drove the outbreak, but our data support an underlying population with a large degree of heterogeneity in their disease-causing contacts. This heterogeneity could point to variation in individual hygiene behaviour or be the result of primary environmental transmission. The model selection results are consistent across all mean degree values, thus adding more confidence to the prediction.",

Network epidemiology has come a long way in demonstrating the impact that the structure of these interactions (which make up the contact network) has on the progression of an infectious disease [5,11,24,49\u201352]. In this study, we have developed a predictive framework to show that common epidemiological measures can give important insights into the contact structure of a host population. The important dependence that has been established between contact network structure and infectious disease dynamics is both a motivation for why a framework like ours is needed and a key to its development. In particular, we have focused on the heterogeneity in the host population's contact structure as represented through the degree distribution. Although degree heterogeneity is only one of the characteristics that describes a network, it has been understood to play a fundamental role in describing variation in disease transmission [24,53], and has been recently shown to in fact account for much of the variation in many cases [54].",

(In our sensitivity analysis, shown in the electronic supplementary material, we find that the R0 classifier improves for more connected populations (mean degree \u2265 10).) All the remaining measures also have mixed results for varying parts of the mean degree and transmissibility parameter space. (Given these results, the development of a joint likelihood approach that combines information from multiple epidemic measures could be productive. Although not the goal of this study, we present a preliminary analysis based on combined metrics in the electronic supplementary material.) Overall, our primary and sensitivity analyses indicate that a less-connected host population with a moderate or highly transmissible pathogen (as often occurs in human sexually transmitted disease systems) can best be classified by final size or peak size; while a highly connected host population with a low or moderately transmissible pathogen (as often is the case for human respiratory disease outbreaks) is better classified by final size and in many cases by duration. That final size is a good classifier is likely due to the low variability it exhibits for a given contact network structure. The exception to the effectiveness of final size as the most reliable metric is that of an extremely sparsely connected (mean degree \u2248 2) and small host population sizes (N < 500).",

In addition, the posterior degree distributions specify reasonable approximations to the true degree distributions, providing a more informed a priori contact structure for predictive and intervention modelling studies of future outbreaks.",

In contrast to the sample sizes in our previous experiments, these predictions are based on one data point each, and still produce predictions that are congruent with our understanding of the respective disease systems. These predictions can also begin to shed some light on the relationship between network structure and certain classes of disease systems (i.e. a pathogen with a given transmission mode and the type of population it spreads in). Sexually transmitted disease spread in heterosexual and homosexual populations has been the most well-studied case in this regard. There has been a significant amount of work investigating the high degree of heterogeneity found in sexual contact networks, made up of the monogamous many and promiscuous few [45,46,48]. The spread of childhood diseases such as measles spreading among cohorts of susceptible children is also a classic example where the level of heterogeneity has typically been assumed (to be low, in this case), although never shown. Our predictions on the Hagelloch outbreak provide evidence in this direction. Few other disease systems have been investigated in this manner and thus we have a poor understanding of whether or not certain contact structures characterize certain classes of diseases. The strong support towards high contact heterogeneity in the norovirus outbreaks points to transmission of gastrointestinal pathogens as being driven by super-spreading events, either due to strong environmental seeding or as a result of individual behaviour.",

Although these additional complexities are not expected to fundamentally weaken the approach, further work is necessary. Lastly, our approach is designed for large-scale epidemics only (i.e. R0 > 1 and the outbreak spreads to a significant proportion of the population).
