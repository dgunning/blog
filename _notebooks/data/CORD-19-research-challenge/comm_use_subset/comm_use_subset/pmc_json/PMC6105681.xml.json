Recent bat-associated paramyxoviruses were proposed to be grouped in a separate phylogenetic clade within a potentially separate genus such as Shaanvirus13 which was distantly related to Jeilongvirus14. In addition, novel strains of bat paramyxoviruses in diverse genera have been reported continuously15\u201317. Based on the recent papers, bat paramyxoviruses found worldwide to date have belonged to the genera Rubulavirus, Morbillivirus, Henipavirus and the unclassified proposed genera Shaanvirus. Expanded classifications for grouping newly identified viruses in bats can be accomplished by further studying the biological characteristics of novel paramyxoviruses as well as genome characterization18.",

These two viruses were only recently proposed to form Jeilongvirus as a distinct genus14. In addition, the newly discovered bat paramyxoviruses, Ms-ParaV/Anhui2011 and BtMl-ParaV/QH2013, were recently proposed to form the additional genus Shaanvirus due to their genomic length and sequence identity differences13. However, their taxonomy has not yet been confirmed by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV, https://talk.ictvonline.org). The proposed genera Shaanvirus and Jeilongvirus have two novel genes putatively encoding SH (small hydrophobic) and TM (transmembrane) proteins12,13. Two viral genes were also located between the fusion and haemagglutinin-neuraminidase genes of bat paramyxovirus B16-40. Further, their nucleotide and amino acids sequences were similar to the SH and TM genes identified from bat paramyxovirus strain Ms-ParaV/Anhui 2011.

Consistent with the genetic findings, the bat paramyxovirus B16-40 was found to have haemagglutinin and neuraminidase activities in the haemadsorption assay (0.5% chicken red blood cells in PBS (pH 7.4)) and neuraminidase assay, respectively (Fig. 2A,B). Notably, even though the HN amino acids sequences were similar to those from viruses in the proposed genera Shaanvirus, it was also related to that of Sendai virus and human parainfluenza virus 1, which belong to a different genus, Respirovirus (Table 1). Maximum-likelihood tree analysis based on the full HN amino acid sequences also showed that the bat paramyxovirus B16-40 was related to viruses in the genus Respirovirus (Supplementary Fig. S1). Therefore, the B16-40 HN amino acid sequence was compared to that of human parainfluenza virus 1 (KBPV-VR-44), and six regions that have at least six conserved amino acids were found. These regions were located on the sialidase superfamily domain and were structurally gathered together (Supplementary Fig. S2). Among the seven neuraminidase active sites (R, D, E, R, R, Y, and E23), two of these (E at the third site and Y) were located within the conserved amino acid sequences. These bioinformatics findings might indicate that the HN proteins of bat paramyxovirus B16-40 and human parainfluenza virus 1 (KBPV-VR-44) are genetically related, even though they are in different genera. Further study on their antigenic and evolutionary relationship should be followed up.",

There may be two possibilities to explain this. First, the African bat might have been infected with a human parainfluenza virus 1-related virus in the genus Respirovirus that has not yet been found. However, as there has been no evidence of bat paramyxoviruses related to the genus Respirovirus in recent studies13,15,16, the first possibility seems low. Second, the bat might have been infected by other bat paramyxoviruses which were cross-reactive with human parainfluenza virus 1. In fact, in this study, when mouse antisera were made and tested against bat paramyxovirus B16-40 and human parainfluenza virus 1 (KBPV-VR-44), the two viruses were partially cross-reactive to each other in an indirect immunofluorescence assay. This result provided an evidence that there could be cross-reactivity between viruses belonging to different genera. Therefore, the bat paramyxovirus B16-40-related viruses circulating in bats might be one of the reasons why the wild bat sera was reactive with human parainfluenza virus 1 in the previous study.",
