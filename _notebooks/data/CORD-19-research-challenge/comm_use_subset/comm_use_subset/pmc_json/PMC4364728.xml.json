The roadblocks to global vaccination programs, including those in remote regions, are prohibitive costs of goods and delivery, use of needles, waste disposal, cold-chain requirements, and the crowded vaccination schedule. Solutions to many of these problems involve developing efficient vaccines that are stable at ambient temperatures that can be applied needle-free with minimal waste, and that combine vaccine antigens to reduce the number of inoculations. Here we present a case for a skin-targeted, freeze-dried formulation, combination human papillomavirus (HPV) pseudovirus (PsV) vaccine composed of the L1 and L2 capsid proteins of HPV16 and plasmids expressing respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) antigens.",

The skin is a potent site of immune induction due to the resident Langerhans cells and dermal dendritic cells poised to initiate immune responses to protect the host [1]. Because skin is so rich in antigen presenting cells (APCs), it is an inductive site that may require relatively low antigen doses and a lower requirement for adjuvants. Microneedle patches are an attractive mechanism for delivering biologics to skin, because they can be simply and painlessly applied to the skin for vaccination and other drug delivery purposes. Microneedles are capable of effectively delivering proteins, viruses and nucleic acids in low doses and can be engineered to be stable, strong, dissolvable and highly reproducible [2]. Naked DNA [3\u20136] and both, influenza [7,8] and HPV [9] virus-like particles (VLP), have been demonstrated to elicit both B and T-cell immune responses after administration to the skin using microneedles. Additionally, using dissolvable microneedles, replication-defective adenoviral vectors [10] and live measles virus vaccine [11] have been successfully administered and induced both CD8+ T cell and antibody responses.",

In addition to cervical cancer, HPV has also been associated with head and neck cancer as well as several other ano-genital cancers [14]. Despite the recent advent of commercial prophylactic HPV L1 VLP-based vaccines targeting the major high-risk cancer-causing types, the high cost of production and requirement for refrigeration make these vaccines inaccessible to most of the individuals in low resource settings, who demonstrate the greatest need for vaccination [15].",

RSV F is relatively conserved across subtypes and cross-neutralizing antibodies have been discovered, making it an attractive target antigen for vaccine development [20,21]. As for many other difficult virus targets that do not yet have vaccine solutions, it may be necessary to induce CD8+ T cell responses in addition to neutralizing antibody responses to achieve immunity that can safely prevent infection [22].",

We have previously reported that HPV PsV, containing both the L1 and L2 capsid proteins, can encapsidate plasmids [23] and deliver genes encoding viral antigens to mucosal tissue successfully eliciting both B- and T-cell responses [24\u201326]. Precedence exists for microneedle-mediated delivery of plasmid DNA to the skin resulting in expression of the encoded reporter genes and vaccine antigens [4,6]. This, in combination with recent work suggesting that the L1 capsid protein-based HPV VLP vaccine, Gardasil, delivered to the skin with microneedles can elicit neutralizing antibodies (nAb) [9], indicates that HPV PsV may be amenable to this delivery method while retaining their functionality. Here we show HPV PsV delivered to the skin using microneedles can induce immune responses to both the HPV capsid and to the antigens delivered by the encapsidated transgenes in the absence of adjuvant. Use of HPV as a delivery vehicle for plasmids encoding vaccine antigens using microneedles may therefore provide a safe and effective platform for the development of combination vaccines that are easily delivered and may have a much lower requirement for maintenance of a cold chain than currently available HPV vaccines.",

After two weeks of room temperature storage followed by rehydration in PBS, the lyophilized luciferase-expressing PsV proved equally effective at gene delivery when compared to previously frozen particles using the in vivo vaginal challenge model (Fig. 3A) and HPV16-GFP (green fluorescent protein) particles rinsed from microneedles were capable of delivering a plasmid in vitro as indicated by transduction of GFP expression into the cell (Fig. 3B). Additionally, efficiency of in vivo particle delivery was examined by inserting PsV-coated microneedles into mice for variable lengths of time, then measuring the amount of particles remaining on the array. Only 20% of the particles remained on the microneedles after 30 s of inoculation (data not shown). Longer inoculation time points did not increase the efficiency of delivery.",

Uncoated microneedles, bifurcated needle puncture (20x) and needle scraping (10x horizontal and 10x vertical scratches) served as controls. Beginning 24 h after HPV16-Luc PsV administration, and continuing daily for seven days, animals were imaged for a luminescent signal indicative of successful delivery and expression of the luciferase gene. A luminescent signal could be detected over background in all PsV conditions tested and the transient kinetics of luciferase expression using this method is similar to what has been previously observed in the vaginal challenge model [26,33,34]. In animals inoculated with 10 microneedles, the signal peaked two days post-administration at levels that were much higher than background (Fig. 3C).

RSV M/M2 has been used as a model antigen for evaluating both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell-induced immunity in mice [32,35]. Microneedles were coated with HPV16-M/M2 or HPV16-Luc and groups consisted of 10, 3 or 1 microneedle arrays for HPV16-M/M2 or 3 microneedle arrays for HPV16-Luc. Anti-HPV16 L1 antibodies could be detected by day 25, indicating that indeed the particles were successfully administered (data not shown). As reported for DNA vaccination, antigen-specific T cells are often undetectable after priming. Therefore boosting or viral challenge is required to assess the quality of priming for T cell responses [36\u201338]. One month after microneedle immunization, animals were divided into two groups: one was challenged with RSV and the other was boosted with a low-dose (107 pfu) of recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 vector (rAd5-M/M2) IM. Epitope-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells were measured in lungs 5 days post-RSV challenge. Only the groups immunized with 10 microneedle arrays demonstrated higher increases in CD8+ T-cell and significant increases in CD4+ T-cell responses (p = 0.04) above baseline after challenge (Fig. 5A and 5B). CD8+ tetramer responses were measured in blood fourteen days after boosting with rAd5-M/M2 and significantly higher responses (p = 0.04) compared to HPV-Luc immunized controls were only observed in animals immunized with 10 microneedle arrays (Fig. 5C).",

Application of the vaccine within the dermal and epidermal layers may be effective at low dose due, in part, to the enrichment of sentinel antigen presenting cells (APCs) that constantly survey the tissue for foreign antigens [1,39]. Langerhans cells and dermal dendritic cells are potent APCs that are directly targeted by the use of microneedle delivery to the skin. These cells represent a continually replenished population of immune stimulators which, once activated, travel to draining lymph nodes to present antigen to T cells. It is not known how the HPV particles were taken up and processed in this study. However, HPV may be especially effective and suited for microneedle delivery as this localizes the viral particles within the epithelium, a context for which they display a natural tropism for basal cells.

With targeted microneedle delivery to basal epithelium based on HPV tropism, the current approach has potential to facilitate DNA delivery of genes expressing other vaccine antigens. In this study, we showed that microneedle delivery of HPV PsV to the skin can elicit both antibody and T cell responses against RSV antigens encoded by plasmid DNA encapsidated within the PsV. While the responses were relatively modest, a dose response was observed, and, in animals receiving the highest dosage, an immune response was generated that was capable of reducing viral replication. Co-administering an HPV PsV expressing an immune modifier could potentially enhance the B- and T-cell responses. Expression of the modifier would be transient thus diminishing safety concerns associated with the adverse effects of long-term expression or overexpression of immune modifiers.",

            "text": "This study addressed three central issues associated with vaccination using microneedles. First, we found that lyophilized HPV VLP or HPV PsV could be applied to microneedles and remain antigenically stable at room temperature. Second, vaccination with HPV VLP generated a robust and protective immune response, supporting the development of microneedle delivery for HPV vaccination in place of IM injection. Third, vaccination with HPV PsV generated strong, protective immune responses against HPV and induced dose-dependent B- and T-cell responses to RSV antigens encoded by the encapsidated DNA. These data support the future development of combination vaccination strategies in which the HPV PsV vector generates immunity against both HPV and the antigen expressed from the encapsidated plasmid DNA. We conclude that vaccination with microneedles may be an ideal method for HPV vaccination as a VLP, and may allow future development of HPV PsV-encapsidated DNA vaccine concepts that would result in immunity to HPV and additional antigens encoded by the DNA.",

HPV16-GFP (green fluorescent protein) was coated onto the microneedles. The coated microneedles were incubated with monolayers of HEp-2 cells, the cells were then examined by flow cytometry 24 hours later to determine the percentage of infected cells. (C) Mice were inoculated with microneedles delivering approximately 1x108 IU (1 MN), 5x108 IU (5 MN) and 1x109 IU (10 MN) of HPV16-Luc PsV encapsidating a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid. Uncoated microneedles (Uncoated MN) containing no PsV were used as a negative control. For animals receiving the bifurcated needle treatment (BF needle) or the needle scratching treatment (scrape), 1x109 IU of the same preparation was added to the skin immediately after skin traumatization. Mice were imaged daily for luciferase signal and the average radiance is shown below each individual animal.
