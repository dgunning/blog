Group A rotaviruses cause diarrhea in pigs both before and after weaning [5] and can account for 53 and 44% pre- and post-weaning rotavirus-associated diarrhea in swine, respectively [6]. A recent report attributed 89% of all rotavirus-associated diarrhea in commercial pig farms to group A rotavirus infections [7]. Since rotaviruses can survive in the environment for long period of time and are transmitted via the fecal-oral route outbreaks are difficult to control. Virion replication occurs at the tips of epithelial cell in intestinal villi and destroy enterocytes primarily in the jejunum and ileum resulting in villous atrophy [8,9]. Furthermore, nutrients cannot be digested or absorbed in the affected regions resulting in severe malabsorption [10]. A better understanding of rotavirus epidemiology will contribute to the optimization of current vaccines and prevention programs for the control of rotavirus infection. Currently available vaccines (mostly killed) can not offer efficient immunity. To stimulate efficient immunity, a large vaccine dose and repeated administration are usually required. This often results in undesirable clinical signs. To overcome these shortcomings, the potential development of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to deliver heterologous antigen to the mucosal immune system has been proposed.",

However, oralvaccination presents a challenge since the gut milieu often denatures and/or inactivates potential vaccinogens therefore large vaccination doses and repeated vaccinations are required[18,19]. This often results in fecal shedding of the live vaccine in addition to causing fever and diarrhea [16,18,19]. These challenges can be overcome by using lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as antigen delivery system for the stimulation of mucosal immunity [20-25] owing to its safety. LAB are used in industrial food fermentation, preservation and have beneficial effects on the health of both humans and animals and 'generally regarded as safe, (GRAS'micro-organisms). In addition, many strains of LAB are able to survive and colonize the intestinal tract [26,27] inducing a non-specific immunoadjuvant effect [28] which prompted studies aimed at determining the oral vaccine potential of LAB-derived vaccines.",
