However, a substantial number of children experience wheezing every time they suffer from a respiratory viral infection, and up to 50% of these subjects develop asthma during school age [3]. The reasons for these different wheezing phenotypes are still unclear. A number of clinical and epidemiological studies have shown that the severity of individual episodes, the risk of recurrence, and the risk of developing asthma are frequently associated with the presence of atopy or particular clinical or environmental conditions such as prematurity and exposure to tobacco smoke [4, 5]. Microbiological studies have shown that not all viruses have the same potential for causing severe or recurrent cases, and that RSV [6] and RV [7] are more frequently identified in the respiratory secretions of subjects with recurrent wheezing. However, analysis of the data collected in studies of the possible relationships between viral LRTIs and wheezing has shown that, even in the absence of known risk factors, a considerable number of children experience severe and/or frequently recurring infections with wheezing, and develop asthma during adolescence [2].",

However, little is known about which immune response mechanisms modified by genetic defects play the major role in conditioning susceptibility to wheezing, or what can be done to increase host defences in such cases. The precise identification of the specific genetic variants involved in immunity that are associated with an increased risk of LRTIs with recurrent wheezing has foreseeable applications in pediatrics, preventive medicine and vaccine development, and it can be expected that analysing methods that can reduce the negative impact of genetic defects in innate or adaptive immunity will have considerable consequences.",

The parents were also asked to complete a diary recording all of their children\u2019s clinical problems and the administration of any drug including antipyretics. To overcome the problem of the possible under-reporting of wheezing episodes, all of the families were systematically telephoned weekly to verify the children\u2019s status. All of the medical examinations (the planned monthly examinations and those following the development of a febrile episode) were carried out by trained investigators (SE and CT) using standardised questionnaires.

Moreover, Daley et al. documented a positive association between TLR3 SNPs and atopic asthma [10]. These discrepancies may be due to differences in the ethnicity and general characteristics of the study populations, such as differences in wheezing phenotypes, because it has been found that recurrent wheezing during the first year after viral LRTI and recurrent wheezing at the age of six years are distinct entities with their own specific immunological and genetic characteristics [39].

As expected, RSV was the most frequently detected pathogen in our study, and its frequency was significantly higher in children with non-recurrent wheezing than in those with recurrent episodes. This may be explained by the fact that the vast majority of our patients were affected by RSV infection, but there was no difference in the distribution of genetic polymorphisms between the children with recurrent or non-recurrent episodes due to RSV infection.",

The IL4Ra gene encodes the alpha chain of the interleukin-4 receptor, a type I transmembrane protein that can bind IL4 and IL13 and thus regulate IgE antibody production in B cells [40], and the encoded protein can also bind IL4 in T cells to promote differentiation of Th2 cells. Allelic variations in this gene have been associated with atopy and allergic clinical manifestations [40]. Furthermore, RV infections are a major cause of asthma exacerbations [41, 42], and RVs have also been repeatedly detected in patients with stable asthma [43]. A number of studies have shown abnormalities in innate immune responses to viruses in patients with asthma, particularly deficiencies in the production of IFN I and III [44\u201346]. The finding that a SNP in the IL4Ra gene is associated with recurrent wheezing episodes during RV LRTI further contributes to explaining the complications that could follow RV infection.",

Secondly, although considerable, the number of studied genes and SNPs was probably less than the number of genes and genetic variations actually involved in regulating the mechanisms that play a role in conditioning susceptibility to infection and the development of wheezing. Finally, we did not evaluate the effect of common environmental exposure on the associations between the genes of the immune pathway and wheezing but, as it has been suggested that environmental exposure may modify the effect of such genetic variants on disease susceptibility, an analysis of gene-environmental interactions is necessary before drawing any definite conclusions.",
