One of the most well-known examples was the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the winter of 2002 and 2003, caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [1,2]. In distinct contrast to the mild human coronaviruses HCoV-229E [3], HCoV-OC43 [4], HCoV-NL63 [5], and HCoV-HKU1 [6], infection with SARS-CoV frequently resulted in severe symptoms including fever, dry cough, shortness of breath and pneumonia. Transmission of SARS-CoV was primarily from person to person and most cases occurred in health care settings lacking adequate infection control precautions [2]. The SARS outbreak had severe consequences in 29 countries and regions, infecting 8096 people worldwide with a fatality rate of approximately 10% [7]. There are still no vaccines or therapeutics specific to SARS-CoV available 16 years after the SARS outbreak. It is not hard to imagine how catastrophic it would be if SARS-CoV were to hit the human community again.",

            "text": "While SARS-CoV remains a mystery and a loose cannon, another novel coronavirus emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012, later known as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [8]. The fatality rate of MERS-CoV infection is approximately 35.4%, and new cases as well as associated deaths continue to arise to date [9]. Despite that most cases have been attributed to human-to-human transmission, MERS-CoV does not appear to transmit efficiently among humans unless there is close contact. The exact source of MERS-CoV and its routes of transmission to humans still remain uncertain. Dromedary camels are believed to be the animal reservoir for MERS-CoV because isolates from camels are almost identical to those from human, and that many domestic camels are seropositive for MERS-CoV (reviewed in [10,11]). Furthermore, current evidence strongly suggests that bats are the original source for MERS-CoV, as many coronaviruses phylogenetically related to MERS-CoV originate in bats, including BatCoV-HKU4, BatCoV-HKU5 and other MERS-related coronaviruses [12\u201315]. The BatCoV-HKU4 was also shown to be able to engage the cellular receptor of MERS-CoV, adding evidence to the bat origin theory [16]. However, there has not yet been direct evidence for isolating MERS-CoV from bats (reviewed in [10,11,17]).",

            "text": "MERS-CoV belongs to the genus betacoronavirus of the coronaviridae family [18]. It is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with a helical capsid structure (Figure 1(A)). The genome of MERS-CoV is around 30 kb (30,119nt) long and encodes 4 structural proteins (Spike, Envelope, Membrane, and Nucleocapsid) and 16 nonstructural proteins (Figure 1(C)) [13]. Like other coronaviruses, the MERS-CoV uses its spike (S) glycoprotein to interact with cellular receptors and enter into the target cell [19\u201322]. As a unique structural component of the virion membrane, the S glycoprotein assembles into trimers and forms large protruding spikes on the surface of the virion [20]. The S glycoprotein is a typical type I membrane glycoprotein consisting of a globular S1 domain at the N-terminal, followed by a membrane-proximal S2 domain and a transmembrane (TM) domain [21]. The S1 domain mediates viral attachment and contains the RBD (receptor binding domain), which determines the host range and cellular tropism for MERS-CoV [23\u201325]. Similar to other coronaviruses, the S2 domain of MERS-CoV, mediating membrane fusion, contains the hydrophobic fusion peptide (FP) at the N-terminus as well as two heptad repeats designated as HR1 and HR2 (Figure 1(C)) [26]. Through co-purification with the MERS-CoV S1 domain, Raj and colleagues identified that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, also known as CD26) functions as a cellular receptor for MERS-CoV [27].\n\n",

Binding between RBD and the cell receptor triggers a cascade of conformational changes that lead to the formation of a pre-hairpin intermediate of S2, in which the hydrophobic HR1 is exposed and allows the fusion peptide to insert into the target cell membrane. This transient S2 intermediate then refolds with HR2 into a stabilized trimer of hairpins, also called six-helix bundle structure (6-HB), which brings the target cell membrane into close proximity of the viral envelope, resulting in the completion of the fusion process and initiation of the virus life cycle [21] (Figure 1(B)). Structure-based design of various peptides able to block the formation of 6-HB have demonstrated potent inhibition on MERS-CoV replication and spike-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion, showing great promise for further development into effective viral fusion inhibitors for treating MERS-CoV infection [26,28\u201330]. Among them, the peptide EK1 is effective to multiple human coronaviruses apart from MERS-CoV and therefore serves as a potential pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor [30].",

            "text": "Recently, structural studies on the prefusion state spike protein of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV have provided more insights into the spike-mediated membrane fusion process [31\u201334]. The MERS-CoV spike protein trimerizes and folds into a metastable prefusion conformation on the virion surface, in which three S1 domains fold into a steady trimer structure and sit on top to stabilize the coiled S2 domains (Figure 2(A\u2013B)). We and others have identified that the RBD of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can be found either buried (\u2018down' position) or exposed (\u2018up' position) in the spike trimer structure [31,33\u201335]. The two conformational states of RBD may have distinct roles during receptor binding and membrane fusion: only the RBDs in \u2018up' position, but not those in \u2018down' position, can bind to the cell receptor DPP4 (Figure 2(C\u2013D)). Great steric clash was observed between DPP4 and neighboring spike protomers when we mapped it to the RBD in \u2018down' position (Figure 2(C\u2013D)). Transformation of the RBD from the buried to the exposed state is therefore a prerequisite for receptor binding (Figure 2(G\u2013H)). On the other hand, this conformational change also seems to open up the stable cap structure sitting above the S2 cores (Figure 2(E\u2013F)). This may lead to disassociation of S1 trimer and exposure of the fusion apparatus, triggering the membrane fusion process.\n\n",

            "text": "To gain a better understanding of MERS-CoV interaction with cellular receptors at atomic levels, we and others have determined the crystal structure of MERS-CoV RBD bound to the extracellular domain of its cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) [23,24]. We showed that MERS-CoV RBD consists of a core and a receptor binding subdomain. MERS-CoV RBD and the related SARS-CoV RBD share a high degree of structural similarity in their core subdomains, but are notably divergent in the receptor binding subdomains [36]. The receptor binding subdomain of MERS-CoV RBD directly interacts with blades 4 and 5 of DPP4 propeller instead of its intrinsic hydrolase domain. The interface consists of a buried surface of \u223c2550 \u00c52 involving 14 residues in receptor binding subdomain interacting with 15 residues in DPP4. The actual binding forces are mediated through two major binding patches. Patch 1 represents 49% of buried surface and forms between the C-terminal end of the long loop connecting the \u03b26 and \u03b27 strands and blade 4 of DPP4. Patch 2 occupies 51% of buried surface and forms a slightly concaved outer surface at the far end of the MERS-CoV receptor binding subdomain and a linker containing a short helix between blade 4 and blade 5 of DPP4. The concaved outer surface is made by the short \u03b26 strand, C-terminal parts of \u03b25 and \u03b27 strands, N-terminal part of \u03b28 strand and the \u03b25-\u03b26 linking loop. It is hoped that better understanding of the atomic details of the spike glycoprotein, as well as the interface between MERS-CoV RBD and DPP4 will provide the structural basis for rational design and development of therapeutics and vaccines against MERS-CoV infection.",

This antibody, 5F9, was shown to successfully block virus entry in cell culture models and the efficacy was comparable to other mAbs in IC50. Further, the mAb panel D12, F11, G2 and G4 were generated by priming mice with DNA encoding the full-length S glycoprotein and boosting them with S1 protein. Among them are two mAbs that target the non-RBD S1 (mAb G2) and S2 region (mAb G4), respectively [49]. These non-RBD-binding antibodies potently neutralized pseudo- and live MERS-CoV in cell culture and were also protective in mouse models [49,50]. Together, the development of these antibodies elucidates that RBD may not be the single target for anti-viral antibody response.

Another group immunized llama with recombinant RBD and screened the nanobody library for high-affinity single heavy chain antibody (nanobody) against RBD. The humanized form NbMS10-Fc was constructed by combining the variable domain of the nanobody with the human constant Fc domain, and it was shown to protect mice from lethal MERS-CoV challenge [60]. Similarly, Stalin et al isolated a nanobody targeting RBD from camels immunized with MVA encoding S glycoprotein. The humanized form HCAb-83 has high binding affinity to S protein and potent neutralizing activities to live virus [61]. These nanobody-derived mAbs are smaller in molecular weight and more stable than traditional antibodies, and may provide a new option for future antibody isolation.\n",

This is also evidenced by a larger overlap between the common epitope of Group 2 antibodies and DPP4-binding site on RBD [23]. As a representative of Group 2 antibodies, m336 exhibits very potent neutralizing activity by not only mimicking critical interactions between RBD and DPP4 but also adopting an approaching angle similar to that of DPP4 (Figure 4(C)).",

By structural determination, it was shown that MERS-4 Fab and MERS-4V2 scFv share the same mode of binding to the RBD (Figure 4(B)) [39]. Analysis of the RBD/MERS-4V2 complex structure showed that the antibody contacts with the \u03b25-\u03b26, \u03b26-\u03b27 and \u03b27-\u03b28 loops of the receptor-binding subdomain in RBD [39]. The epitope involves Leu507, Ser508, Gln516, Asn519, Asn521, Gln522, Tyr523, Pro525, Lys543, Leu545, and Gly550 [39]. To be note, the MERS-4 epitope has no overlap with DPP4-binding site (Figure 4(C)). By approaching the RBD outside the DPP4-binding site, MERS-4 recognizes a unique epitope different from all previously reported RBD-targeting antibodies. Comparisons of RBD in DPP4-bound and MERS-4-bound states revealed that binding of MERS-4 induces or fixes the \u03b25-\u03b26 loop into a conformation in which it folds into a shallow groove on the RBD interface critical for accommodating a short helix of DPP4, thereby indirectly disrupting the interaction between RBD and DPP4 (Figure 4(C)). Such different epitope and mechanism enable MERS-4 to synergize with other antibodies including RBD-targeting MERS-27 and m336 in neutralization, which provides valuable addition for the combined use of antibodies against MERS-CoV infection [39].",

G4 is the first reported S2-targeting antibody and its epitope consists of a glycosylated, solvent-exposed loop residing in a connector domain between the HR1 and HR2 of the S2 subunit. In the unbound spike trimer structure this loop is largely disordered, whereas it extends out from two \u03b2-strands and is surrounded by all six CDRs (complementarity determining regions) of the mAb G4 upon antibody recognition (Figure 4(E)). The specific spike-G4 interaction may stabilize the loop and further impede conformational changes of S2 subunit essential for membrane fusion after DPP4 binding. The binding epitope for G4 in S2 subunit is more conserved than RBD among MERS-CoV isolates, shedding light on G4 as a potential broad-spectrum neutralizing antibody for MERS-CoV. Yet this loop between HR1 and HR2 is variable in sequence and length among different viruses even in lineage C betacoronaviruses [33], limiting its application to other coronaviruses. In terms of pan-coronavirus medical countermeasures (MCMs), the recently developed fusion inhibitor peptide EK1 is a potential candidate. The peptide EK1 was designed to target the more conserved HR1 region of the S2 stem, and was shown to block cell\u2013cell fusion induced by spike protein from multiple human coronaviruses [30].",

These facts show that the RBD in the S1 subunit is a major vulnerable site for antibody recognition and neutralization. To be note, the RBD is also the region where most naturally occurring mutations of the S glycoprotein occur. Currently, the comprehensively studied antibodies targeting the non-RBD region of the spike glycoprotein also include mAb 5F9 targeting the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S1 subunit [57], as well as mAbs G2, CDC2-A2, CDC2-A10, JC57-13 and FIB-H1 targeting the non-RBD region of the S1 subunit [33,50]. However, the detailed epitopes and specific mechanisms are still unclear for these antibodies. We expect that more antibodies with new neutralizing epitopes and/or mechanisms would be important for the combined use of antibodies against MERS-CoV infection.",

It is a DNA plasmid encoding the MERS-CoV S glycoprotein, requiring two-to-three injections delivered by electroporation [81]. The phase I clinical trial was started in 2016 at the Walter Reed Army Institute, and another phase I/II clinical trial is being conducted in Korea to test dosage safety and immunogenicity. Another vaccine candidate, MERS001, is a replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAdOx1) containing the MERS-CoV S glycoprotein antigen [70,71]. This vaccine only requires one-time administration of 5\u00d7109\u20135\u00d71010 virus particles via intramuscular route, and the local adverse events as well as immunogenicity will be evaluated in the phase I clinical trial conducted at the University of Oxford. In addition, one more candidate vaccine has been tested in dromedary camels either for potential human use or straight into veterinary use. It explores a modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) as a vector to express MERS-CoV S glycoprotein [67]. The regimen involves immunization through intranasal as well as intramuscular routes twice at a 4-week interval. The vaccinated camels demonstrated a significant reduction of excreted infectious virus and viral RNA transcripts in vaccinated animals upon MERS-CoV challenge. Protection against MERS-CoV infection correlated with the presence of serum neutralizing antibodies to MERS-CoV. As MVA has established a reasonably good safety profile in humans and induced desirable protective immunity in camels, it represents one of the potential candidates to be further evaluated in humans in the near future.",

            "text": "Apart from MERS001 and the MVA-based vaccine tested in dromedary camels, other vector-based approaches are also being actively pursued, including adenovirus [68,69,72,73,80], measles virus [74,75], VEEV replicon particle [76,77], vesicular stomatitis virus [78], and rabies virus [79]. All recombinant viruses encoding the MERS-CoV S or S1 antigen demonstrated strong immunogenicity in mice or non-human primate models, and some were shown to confer protection in MERS-CoV challenge mouse models (Table 2). However, concerns remain regarding the pre-existing immunity against these viral vectors from natural infection, because it would diminish the vaccine potency [95]. To overcome the issue of pre-existing immunity against human adenoviruses while preserving their advantages such as high yields and strong immunogenicity, rare serotypes of chimpanzee adenovirus of low human seroprevalence may be adopted as viral vectors [70,73]. Our group recently developed a vaccine candidate with replication-defective chimpanzee adenovirus C68 (AdC68) vector expressing full length MERS-CoV S glycoprotein. Seroprevalence of AdC68 is around 2% in human population, much lower than that of the commonly used human adenovirus 5 (HuAd5) vector (>60%) [96,97]. One intra-nasal administration of 2 \u00d7 109 viral particles completely protected human DPP4 knock-in (hDPP4-KI) mice from lethal MERS-CoV challenge, and passive transfer of AdC68-S immune sera conferred survival advantage in lethal challenge mouse models [73]. Further, the safety profiles of these vectors have yet to be extensively tested in humans. Recently, Hashem and colleagues showed that the adenovirus-based S1 vaccine may pose potential safety concerns because it may induce pulmonary perivascular hemorrhage in a MERS-CoV challenge mouse model, regardless of the its full protection upon lethal viral infection. They also showed that the pulmonary pathology can be mitigated by incorporating CD40L, an immune-modulator therefore potential molecular adjuvant, into the recombinant adenovirus-based vaccine [72]. Whether this vaccine-associated pathology is related to residual infectious viruses or unbalanced immune responses awaits further investigation. With this in mind, all future MERS-CoV vaccine candidate designs should take extra cautions on safety evaluation.",

            "text": "Furthermore, recombinant-protein-based vaccines are widely pursued. Strategies to solubilize the MERS-CoV S glycoprotein in order to form stable immunogens include forming nanoparticles and using soluble protein truncations. In particular, both nanoparticles formed with full length MERS-CoV S glycoprotein [93,94] and subunit RBD-based vaccines [83\u201390] have been shown to induce virus neutralizing anti\u00adbodies and to protect mice when challenged with MERS-CoV. One RBD subunit vaccine also conferred protection in rhesus macaques [91]. This indicates that RBD alone as antigen may be sufficient for protective immunity to develop against the virus. Along with the finding that mAb targeting NTD is able to neutralize MERS-CoV, Lan et al showed that three doses of intramuscularly administered recombinant NTD protein also induced protective immunity against live MERS-CoV in human DPP4 transduced mouse model (Ad5-hDPP4 mice) [92]. More recently, with the structural insights into the spike glycoprotein, Pallesen et al developed a prefusion-stabilized S trimer vaccine by substituting proline residues into the S2 domain [33]. The introduction of proline disfavours the refolding of the linker between HR1 and the central helix, thus preventing the transition of spike into the post-fusion state. This rationally designed antigen, MERS S-2P, was shown to induce broader and more potent neutralizing activity than wild type spike trimer protein [33].",

Despite the differences in geographic location, epidemiology and immediate animal reservoirs, these two viruses share remarkable similarity in causing severe respiratory syndrome, leading to high fatality in humans and trigger serious public health concerns. With the advent of modern techniques in virology, immunology and vaccinology, we have gained substantial insights into the biology of MERS-CoV, and its pathogenesis with unprecedented speed and accuracy. As summarized in the current review, tremendous progress has been made in understanding (1) the entry process of MERS-CoV into target cells, (2) the structure and function of S glycoprotein and cellular receptor DPP4 in mediating viral entry, (3) antibody response during natural infection and isolation of broad and potent neutralizing mAbs, and (4) design and development of vaccine candidates using various innovative technologies. However, our progress in translating these discoveries into clinical application has been slow. Only two vaccine candidates and one mAb panel have entered phase I clinical trials for safety. Ironically, no vaccines and treatment strategies have been approved for SARS-CoV infection even after more than a decade of outbreak. We could not imagine how catastrophic it would be should SARS-CoV hit again or MERS-CoV continues to probe and gain strong capacity in transmission to and among humans.",

On one hand, the human population is becoming ever mobile and exposed to an increasing number of pathogens. On the other hand, translating basic discoveries into preventative and treatment applications has been exceedingly slow. Among many plausible reasons, a lack of incentives in financial returns perhaps stands the tallest. The deadlock is not just happening to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV but also to many other infectious pathogens such as Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, highly pathogenic avian influenza, HIV-1, and so on. Fundamental and drastic changes have to be made in the entire research and development system before we can truly prepare and position ourselves ahead of deadly epidemic and pandemic. Only then, can our speed and accuracy in basic discovery be timely translated into clinical and public health needs. The time to act is now.",

This transient S2 intermediate then refolds with HR2 into a stabilized trimer of hairpins, also called six-helix bundle structure (6-HB), bringing the target cell membrane into close proximity of the viral envelope and resulting in the completion of the fusion process.
