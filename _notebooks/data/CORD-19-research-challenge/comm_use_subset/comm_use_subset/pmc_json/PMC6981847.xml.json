The WHO reported that the next influenza pandemic \u201cis a matter of when, not if\u201d [2], and the world must prepare for the next inevitable flu pandemic. What can we do when the pandemic comes? Outside pharmaceutical interventions, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) play an important role in delaying the first wave, reducing its peak and the spreading of new influenza cases across time [3,4] because a pandemic vaccine will not be in place when a pandemic starts. NPIs include more actions than just self-isolation (SI), such as quarantining infected populations; the closing of borders, schools, and work places; hand-washing; the cleaning of surfaces; and so on [5]. The isolation of infected people has been applied to minimize the spread of pandemic diseases at least since the Old Testament period as an instrument for controlling and quelling the spread of viruses and contamination agents [6]. Hence, isolation is seen as a critical part of public health interventions, as it protects people by separating those who have been infected by communicable diseases from the general population [7].",

SI means symptomatic individuals confine themselves to their homes [10]. Generally, isolation can take two forms: Mandatory and voluntary [11,12]. Voluntary SI means that infected (or possibly infected) individuals choose to confine themselves to their homes; this intervention is generally considered capable of limiting the transmission of pandemic influenza [13,14] and is recommended by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [15]. The early initiation of voluntary SI can overcome the negative effects of a delay in antiviral drug distribution when enough symptomatic individuals comply with home confinement at symptom onset [14]. Overall, SI is of great importance for hampering the spread of pandemics and has been widely studied based on different methods. The effectiveness of voluntary SI largely depends on public adherence to this intervention measure [14]. Unfortunately, voluntary SI strategies may inconvenience individuals, lead to economic losses, or even contribute to moral conflicts; thus, voluntary SI remains a controversial strategy [15,16].",

However, the factors involved in SI should not be neglected, and it is important to investigate which factors will encourage infected (or possibly infected) people to choose self-isolation. Surveys conducted in the United States (US) and Australia during the 2009 pandemic showed that more than 80% of people were willing to stay home from work or school [17,18], while 53\u201376% of people were willing to self-isolate [17,19]. According to the self-reported behavioral intention regarding the H1N1 influenza of university students in southwestern US, Mas et al. (2012) claimed that an array of issues may influence students\u2019 decision to self-isolate, including interpersonal, academic, environmental, and social factors [20]; however, their analysis lacks an empirical basis. Risk perception has been widely established as a significant predictor of engagement in preventive health behaviors, including SI [21]; those who report being unfamiliar with the term \u201cpandemic influenza,\u201d male respondents, and employed people who are not able to work from home have been found to be less willing to comply [22]. A survey in two counties in North Carolina showed that 50% of households with children under 18 and 65% of working adults reported the ability to comply with SI at home for 7\u201310 days if recommended to do so by the authorities [23]. Concomitantly, recent polls have shown that the willingness to comply with an SI period strongly depends on the social condition and literacy of the individual [24].",

The TPB is a cognitive theory that provides a useful framework for predicting and identifying health-related behaviors, which are usually found to predict behavioral intentions with a high degree of accuracy. The TPB proposes that the individual is influenced by three factors (see Figure 1): Attitudes toward the behavior (ATT), subjective norms with respect to the behavior (SN), and perceived control over the behavior (PBC) [26,27]. The TPB has been explored in relation to behaviors such as counterproductive work behaviors [28], safe sexual behaviors among drug users [29], consumption of a low-fat diet [30], and healthy eating behaviors [31]. For all of these reasons, it is appropriate to apply the TPB to the study of SI intention when facing pandemic risk. ",

ATT refers to the degree to which a person has a favorable or unfavorable evaluation or appraisal of the behavior in question [26]. The TPB is an extension of the theory of reasoned action [32,33], and the individual\u2019s intention is a central factor of performing a given behavior: When the intention to engage in a behavior is stronger, the behavior is more likely to be adopted [26]. Consequently, the effect of ATT on SI can be positive or negative. SN refers to the perceived social pressure to perform a behavior or not [26,34]. People are sensitive to the conformity pressures associated with real and perceived social norms as related to risk behavior [35]. As many studies have noted, SN and ATT are suggested to exert their effects on behavior through intentions [27]. PBC refers to the perceived ease or difficulty of performing the behavior, and it is assumed to reflect past experience as well as anticipated obstacles [26]. PBC has been found to influence both behavioral intentions and actual behavior [36]. The resources and opportunities available to a person must, to some extent, dictate the likelihood of behavioral achievement [26].",

Here, the factors that affect SI are similar to those identified at the beginning of a pandemic, such as H1N1, HIV, and SARS, suggesting that gender has an effect on SI [40]. A strong intention to comply with government-advised preventive measures in the future is associated with higher age [41,42]. Education (Edu) plays an important role in individual choice. People with less education receive less information about pandemics than people with higher education, which indicates that less educated groups are less likely to understand the importance of SI [43]. Personal behavior during an epidemic depends on an individual\u2019s socioeconomic status (SS), as well as his or her perception of the epidemic in the community [44]. Married people enjoy better physical and mental health than people who are not married [45], so marital status may play a role in people\u2019s behavior. Family members in need of special care (FNSC) are children, the elderly, those with disabilities, and those with chronic diseases. Respondents who live with people with these conditions have a higher risk perception concerning health [46,47,48]. Therefore, we assume that respondents with family members in need of special care have higher perceived risks. Furthermore, government trust (GT) [49,50,51], community resources (CRs) [52,53], and emergency services (ES) [49] are among the other variables affecting SI.",

A market research company, LTD, which has a professional computerized database, was entrusted to carry out an online survey of pandemic prevention from 14 October to 3 November in 2018. The survey included the following steps. First, we determined the basic demographic characteristics such as gender, age, and education status of the respondents based on the 2017 Guangdong Internet Industry Development Report, which was published by the Guangdong Communications Administration. Second, a questionnaire was designed, which involved many aspects of SI. Third, 121 county-level units and 21 county-level city units were selected according to the statistical yearbook of Guangdong province 2018. Fourth, we transformed the designed questionnaire into a network questionnaire and sent it to the random sampling objects (2500 questionnaires) through a network link. Each interviewee was asked to provide a contact phone number. Finally, 2155 questionnaires were collected in Guangdong Province, which gives a gross response rate of 86.2% (2155/2500). After the survey, we made random checks of the respondents\u2019 URLs and contacted some interviewees to ensure that every respondent was unique. Finally, we cleaned the data and obtained 1925 respondents; some subjects were excluded due to missing values. The net response rate was thus 77% (1925/2500). ",

The effects on SI of having a family member who is old or who has a disability are significant and negative, while the effect of having a family member with a chronic disease is significant and positive.
