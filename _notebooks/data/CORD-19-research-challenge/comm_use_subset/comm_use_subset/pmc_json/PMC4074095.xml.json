To help implement the new laws, Health Emergency Response Offices (HERO) were established within China\u2019s health administration units at the national, provincial and municipal levels, in Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and in tertiary hospitals [12]. The HEROs within any one province now collectively employ around 1000 staff members, and their role is to help develop and coordinate preparedness planning and emergency response within their jurisdictions, as well as implement the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) [13]. However, because staff members were recruited opportunistically from diverse professional backgrounds into the newly established HEROs, they had not been trained systematically in emergency preparedness and response previously. While they received in-service training, this was offered in an ad hoc manner, was not preceded by a needs assessment [14], and was aimed primarily at improving knowledge of the new laws that did not translate directly into strengthening performance of the HEROs [15], [16].",

In 2004, the World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine (WADEM) proposed a framework for disaster health to facilitate the development of educational programs in the field [17]. Efforts were directed at identifying and defining criteria for assessing disaster health-related competencies, standards for guiding curricular development, and exploring the methods, duration and desired outcomes of training [17]\u2013[19]. Australia for example, developed a national framework for disaster health education to provide guidance for educators to achieve a standardized and integrated approach across the country [20]. Australia adapted the WADEM recommendations to target seven educational levels, and outlined the curricular contents and outcomes for each level; the seven levels were defined as 1) informing the community, 2) raising awareness of health workers, 3) providing basic knowledge and skills for health workers, 4) advancing the knowledge of health workers who play lead roles in disaster management, 5) enhancing expert knowledge among a small group of health workers, 6) targeting specialist level amongst a small group of individuals, and 7) encouraging research and innovation to further develop the knowledge base of disaster health [20].",

Furthermore, while training programs in the past had targeted knowledge and skills required by technical staff such as epidemiologists, laboratory scientists and environmental staff, they had not incorporated skills in mobilizing, managing and coordinating teams across multiple sectors, disciplines and agencies. The respondents stressed the need for adopting interactive learning methods and problem-solving exercises in the classroom, as had been suggested in Chinese publications [26]\u2013[29]. They supported replacing the \u2018hazard-specific\u2019 approach with the \u2018all hazards\u2019 approach to managing emergencies, development of a competency-based curriculum with modules that addressed specific sets of competency domains, and limiting the duration of in-service training to about 2 to 3 weeks so these interfered minimally with trainees\u2019 regular work responsibilities.",

This initial effort focused strongly on meeting the WHO requirements for developing the core capacities required to implement the IHR [21], and in particular, to strengthen the competencies of the \u201clevel four\u201d health staff [20] who play lead roles in emergency planning and management. Our approach for identifying and developing competencies and standards are consistent with those published by WADEM in 2013 [18], [19], and in many ways resemble those used in Australia [20]. The initial list of 18 competency domains were derived from the eight core capacities required to implement the IHR [21] and the disaster management cycle of prevention, preparedness, response and recovery [17], both of which are embedded in Chinese laws and regulations [7]\u2013[12]. The scope of the task and all aspects of the needs assessment and identification of the competencies were developed through iterative inputs from subject matter experts in the Ministry of Health, academia and the military. The mode of curriculum delivery was based on blended learning methods implicit in Bloom\u2019s taxonomy as outlined in the Australian framework [20]. The duration of training for the level four workers In Australia is recommended for 40 hours [20]; by contrast, our course was conducted over 100 hours because the target group had received little training in the past and included workers with diverse sets of past experience. However, consistent with the WADEM guidelines [17]\u2013[20], China needs to reconcile its curriculum with international standards and expand its efforts to develop and standardize training frameworks for the other six WADEM levels [20], as well as interconnect with the \u201ccross-cutting\u201d competencies of workers from the other disciplines that participate in emergency responses [19]. Adopting the international standards and practice will also enhance communications, inter-agency cooperation and inter-operability across China\u2019s national borders.",
