Depending upon route of inoculation and strain of MHV, different regions of the CNS are affected. Inoculation with experimental neurotropic strains JHM and MHV-A59 induces a biphasic disease with acute meningoencephalitis (in first 10\u201314 days post inoculation) followed by subacute and chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease (Stohlman and Weiner, 1981; Lavi et al., 1984; Das Sarma et al., 2000). Both JHM and MHV-A59 strains of MHV cause some subacute and chronic inflammatory demyelination in the brain, but a much larger disease burden in the spinal cord. Translocation of virus from initial site of inoculation in brain to spinal cord occurs by trafficking of virus particle in neural and glial cells (Perlman et al., 1995; Sun and Perlman, 1995).",

Similarly, intracranial inoculation has been well used as a method for MHV-A59 to cause the biphasic disease (Das Sarma et al., 2000, 2002), while a higher dose of MHV-A59 is required to reach the same level of inflammation in CEACAM-/- mice when inoculated through the nasal route (Blau et al., 2001; Hemmila et al., 2004). With intracranial inoculation, the inflammation is not limited to brain and spinal cord. MHV-A59 and recombinant strain RSA59 cause inflammation in optic nerve with subsequent demyelination of optic nerve and RGC loss (Shindler et al., 2008, 2011). Studies of isogenic recombinant strains RSA59 and RSMHV2 of demyelinating strain (MHV-A59) and non-demyelinating strain (MHV2), respectively, containing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) have elaborated the mechanisms of demyelination and axonal loss and have helped in tracking and tracing of virus in vitro as well as in vivo (Das Sarma et al., 2009). RSA59 can cause demyelination, but RSMHV2 cannot, which makes it a suitable control to determine the cellular and molecular basis of demyelination in mice.",

This has led investigators to suggest that interneuronal transport is one mechanism of viral spread during acute encephalitis (Barthold, 1988; Lavi et al., 1988; Barnett et al., 1993), and studies showing spread of virus sequentially from cerebral hemispheres to brainstem to spinal cord (Perlman et al., 1990) provide further support for this interneuronal transport mechanism. Similar axonal transport of virus from brain to spinal cord (Das Sarma et al., 2009), as well as from brain to optic nerve (Shindler et al., 2008, 2011), has been reported following intracranial inoculation with MHV-A59 or RSA59 and may serve as one mechanism for virus to avoid immune surveillance; however, axonal spread to optic nerve has not been well examined following intranasal inoculation.",

            "text": "Different intra- and extracellular pathways may help facilitate viral transport across olfactory or respiratory epithelial barriers. Endocytosis into olfactory sensory neurons followed by intraneuronal transport to the olfactory bulb, or transcellular transport to the lamina propria via sustentacular cells, have been suggested as potential intracellular pathways (Kristensson and Olsson, 1971; Broadwell and Balin, 1985; Thorne et al., 1995; Doty, 2008; Kristensson, 2011). Delivery of large molecular weight biological therapies (e.g., stem cells, gene therapy vectors, and large proteins) to the CNS via intranasal administration has been explored as a potential method to treat multiple CNS diseases/disorders including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, multiple sclerosis, seizures, strokes, and psychiatric disorders (Costantino et al., 2007; Neuwelt et al., 2008; Dhuria et al., 2010). Spread of smaller peptides through rodent brain following intranasal administration occurs rapidly, with diffuse brain distribution and greatest levels found in olfactory bulbs and trigeminal nerves, just 1 h after treatment. IGF-1 (MW = 7.65 kDa) is one of the most studied proteins using intranasal delivery to the CNS (Thorne et al., 2004). Even entry of some high molecular weight proteins such as VEGF (MW = 38.2 kDa) to the CNS has been shown following intranasal administration (Yang et al., 2009). Recently, it has been shown that proteins in a complex biologic therapy, ST266, administered via the intranasal route in rats reached the CNS within 30 min, and ST266 proteins were detected in the vitreous and the optic nerve at markedly higher concentrations than in the brain (Khan et al., 2017), suggesting a rapid, direct nose-to-optic nerve delivery method for proteins. Whether viruses can follow similar pathways to preferentially spread to optic nerve at low inoculation titers has not been reported, but if such pathways are present, the rapid spread of virus could provide an additional mechanism for immune evasion and therefore promote viral infection at lower inoculation titers.",

Thus, the potential for MHV viruses to similarly spread to optic nerve and retina was assessed 1 day following intranasal inoculation. Four-week-old, MHV-free, C57BL/6J mice were inoculated intranasally with 50% of the LD50 dose of RSA59 or RSMHV2, and mice were euthanized 1 day later. Retinas and optic nerves were isolated, sectioned, and immunostained with anti-viral nucleocapsid antisera to detect viral spread. No significant staining was observed in any of the retinas or optic nerves from mock-infected (n = 6), RSA59-infected (n = 6), or RSMHV2-infected (n = 6) mice (Figure 4). As shown in prior studies (Shindler et al., 2011), viral antigen does not reach the retina within 1 day following intracranial inoculation with RSA59 (data not shown). Viral antigen is found in the retina 6 days after intrancranial inoculation (Figure 4), while no antigen is detectable in retina following intranasal inoculation at day 1 (Figure 4) or any later time points (data not shown). To further confirm that intranasal RSA59 administration fails to induce optic neuritis, acutely, optic nerve sections were immunostained for the microglial/macrophage marker Iba1. Previously, it has been observed that intracranial inoculation with RSA59 induces acute optic nerve inflammation containing almost entirely activated microglia/macrophages (Shindler et al., 2011) 3\u20136 days post-inoculation. To study whether intranasal inoculation rapidly induces similar optic nerve inflammation, optic nerve sections were stained with anti-Iba1 antibody. Sections from mock-infected mice were used to demonstrate resting levels of microglial staining. Iba-1 staining did not reveal any increased numbers of microglia/macrophages in optic nerve sections following intranasal viral inoculation as compared to mock-infected (Figure 4). To confirm that lack of viral antigen detection in the optic nerve represents a failure of the virus to spread to optic nerve and retina, and not a failure to detect viral antigen, viral antigen was also examined in olfactory bulb sections from the same mice by autofluoresence of EGFP (Figures 4 J,K) as well as immunostaining with anti-viral nucleocapsid antisera (Figures 4 L,M).",

Results suggest intracranial inoculation is the best method to induce neuroinflammation. In the current study, intracranial infection of RSA59 lead to chronic stage inflammation and demyelination in both the optic nerve and spinal cord. This result is consistent with earlier studies where intracranial inoculation of RSA59 or its parental strain MHV-A59 led to demyelination and axonal loss in spinal cord (Das Sarma et al., 2008, 2009) and optic nerve (Shindler et al., 2008, 2011). Induction of optic neuritis by intracranial inoculation of RSA59 is dependent on retrograde transport of viral antigen along RGC axons that occurs over several days and results in late stage demyelination (Shindler et al., 2011) as seen again in the current study. Together, spinal cord and optic nerve pathology observed after intracranial inoculation of RSA59 in the current study confirm that the viral titer used retains its previously identified ability to induce CNS demyelinating disease.",

            "text": "While intrancranial inoculation was shown previously to induce optic neuritis (Shindler et al., 2008, 2011), effects of intranasal inoculation with RSA59 on optic nerve pathology were not reported. In the current study, intranasal infection by RSA59 at the same dose used for intracranial inoculation was not able to induce any neuropathogenesis, either in optic nerve or spinal cord. Earlier studies with several other strains showed that intranasal inoculation of MHV can cause CNS disease, but much higher concentrations of virus were used than in intracranial inoculation studies. MHV-JHM enters the central nervous system (CNS) via the olfactory after intranasal inoculation (Barnett and Perlman, 1993). The intranasal inoculation of JHM strain can lead to encephalitis and demyelination. The OBLV strain of MHV can infect the main olfactory bulb (Schwob et al., 2001). Intranasal inoculation of MHV-A59 can lead to hepatitis with measurable viral load in brain as well (Hemmila et al., 2004). These studies did not report optic nerve pathogenesis following intranasal inoculation although it is not known if that was examined. There are several possible reasons that we did not see retinal infection or optic nerve inflammation and demyelination lesions after intranasal inoculation. Most likely, the dose of virus may have been too low to cause the pathogenesis. This finding was not unexpected in the spinal cord, where previous studies showed higher doses were necessary. However, based on the high levels of protein accumulation in optic nerve and eye following intranasal inoculation (Khan et al., 2017), it was anticipated that RSA59 would also preferentially accumulate in the eye, but results suggest that higher doses are likely required. Alternatively, the intranasal inoculation may be less effective for inducing optic neuritis and retinal lesions than the intracerebral route because of the longer distance required for the virus to travel to the eye if it travels via axonal transport and neuron-neuron spread similar to what has been observed following intracranial inoculation (Das Sarma et al., 2009; Shindler et al., 2011).",

            "text": "The precise mechanisms mediating spread of a virus or a drug from the nose to various CNS regions are not fully elucidated. At least three steps are necessary following intranasal administration (1) crossing the epithelial barrier in the nasal cavity, (2) transport from nasal mucosa to site of brain entry, likely across the cribiform plate, (3) transport from the site of brain entry to other anatomical regions. Alternatively, they may be absorbed into the systemic circulation and gain secondary access to the CNS through the blood brain barrier. The speed at which proteins were reported to reach the eye and optic nerve, 30 min after intranasal administration (Khan et al., 2017), suggests hematogenous spread is very unlikely, and that intraaxonal transport is even more unlikely. It was hypothesized that perhaps some pathway of local diffusion or lymphatic pathway may allow rapid protein diffusion over the relatively short distance from absorption through the cribiform plate to optic nerve (Khan et al., 2017). For RSA59, prior intracranial studies demonstrate that the virus can use axonal transport machinery to spread intraneuronally (Das Sarma et al., 2009), thus it is likely that a similar mechanism would be used after intranasal administration and entry into the olfactory nerve. The path from there to optic nerve is not direct, and thus may require much higher titers of virus to occur at a pathologic level, or may not be possible at all. These hypothesized mechanisms may explain why we were not able to see viral staining day 1 post infection whereas the drug ST266 and other small molecules can be found in optic nerve as early as 30 min post intranasal inoculation (Dhuria et al., 2010; Khan et al., 2017).",

Interestingly, complex mixtures containing physiologic concentrations of multiple proteins show that protein can rapidly accumulate in the eye and optic nerve following intranasal delivery, suggesting a direct nose to eye diffusion pathway that remains to be fully elucidated (Khan et al., 2017). The current results show that RSA59 does not follow a similar pattern of accumulation in the optic nerve, suggesting that viral particle may be too large or complex to follow the same pathway, or may actively enter neurons locally and restrict their movement to intraneuronal axonal transport. Nonetheless, the ability of neurotropic MHV viruses to infect different cells, translocate throughout the CNS, and induce inflammatory demyelination, continues to provide a reproducible model to study optic nerve and spinal cord demyelinating disease following intracranial inoculation. Thus, intracranial inoculation should continue to be considered a preferred method for studies of MHV-induced optic neuritis and CNS demyelinating disease.",
