Among these, influenza virus types A and B are the main considered, as they cause annual epidemics with high morbidity and considerable mortality [1]. In contrast, influenza C virus has been regarded as a pathogen of minor relevance, causing mild or clinically unapparent disease [2,3]. Nevertheless, in recent years, detections of influenza C in hospitalised young children with (severe) lower respiratory tract disease were reported [4-9]. Thus, the clinical and epidemiological significance of this virus species might have been underestimated and needs to be reassessed.",

The few studies published mainly focus on clinical data, mostly from hospitalised children [4,9,10]. In Germany, no surveillance data and no sequence information on circulating influenza C viruses have ever been reported. Therefore, we decided to search for influenza C in our outpatient sample collection assembled for the purpose of influenza virus surveillance in Germany. As young children are described to have the highest infection rates [6,7,11], we confined our study to the 0\u20134 year-old age group. We furthermore sequenced the haemagglutinin esterase (HE) gene from influenza C-positive samples to phylogenetically characterise the detected viruses.",

An ILI case is defined by a sudden disease onset with at least one of four systemic symptoms (fever or feverishness, malaise, headache, myalgia) and at least one of three respiratory symptoms (cough, sore throat, shortness of breath) [13], while ARI is an acute respiratory disease with at least one of the four following symptoms: fever, cough, rhinorrhoea or sore throat. The samples are sent to the German National Influenza Centre, accompanied by a completed questionnaire on patient characteristics, sampling date, disease symptoms, influenza vaccination status and therapeutic intervention i.e. antiviral treatment. They are routinely analysed for influenza virus types A and B, human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) as well as \u2013 since April 2013 \u2013 human adenovirus (AdV), metapneumovirus (HMPV) and rhinovirus (HRV).

Some studies indicated a low clinical impact with only mild symptoms [2,3,17], and in spite of a high seroprevalence in the population, virus detections were rare [6,11,18]. These findings led to the conclusion that influenza C infection is common, but clinically inapparent or too mild to require a visit to a doctor [2]. Additionally, the low detection rate may be in part due to the fact that in earlier times virus diagnostics were mainly based on virus culture, which is difficult for influenza C [6,19] and necessitates conditions that differ from influenza A and B virus cultivation [20]. As a consequence, influenza C virus diagnostics were restricted to specialised laboratories and correspondingly rare [4].",

In a 6-month prospective study (December 2009\u2013May 2010) including Japanese children with community-acquired pneumonia, bronchiolitis or bronchitis, influenza C infection was identified even with a prevalence approximating those of influenza A or HMPV [5]. Further studies, mostly in children, described the symptoms of influenza C infection to be indistinguishable from influenza A and B infections [4,6], although the maximum body temperature may be lower and the fever shorter compared with influenza A [6,21,22]. In Finnish military recruits, influenza C virus caused common cold-like symptoms, but occasionally resulted in pneumonia and bronchitis [3].",

In an extensive validation effort according to international standards [29], we found the singleplex as well as the duplex format to perform with high sensitivity, specificity and precision. We therefore applied it to our sample compilation and identified influenza C RNA in 20 of 1,570 samples with valid qPCR results (1.3%). The vast majority of virus detections (16 of 20) was found in samples that were collected between October 2012 and April 2013, signalling a more pronounced virus circulation during these months with positivity rates of up to 7.1% (5/70) in November 2012. As these samples were collected in 10 of 16 German federal states, virus circulation was not confined to a region, but widespread, maybe even nationwide. The virus prevalence however was markedly lower during the other winter seasons observed in this study, and no virus could be detected during the summer months. This absence of summer circulation is in congruence with reports from Japan, France, Finland and Spain [3,4,6,10,25], but is in contradiction to a report from Catalonia in Spain, in which the majority of positive samples were taken in August and September of the observed time span [21]. An upsurge of influenza C virus circulation in the spring of 2013 was also observed in the Philippines [8], but did not occur in Japan, from where virus circulation in even numbered years was reported, including the years 2012 and 2014 [11,30]. However, a biennial pattern of virus circulation with increased or time-shifted profile has also been described for other respiratory viruses in Germany [31,32] and therefore is conceivable, but remains open in our study due to the short study period, which presents a limitation. In total, the proportion of influenza C-positive patients was small, but within the expected range. It needs to be emphasised though, that the obtained overall positivity rate is largely based on only few months during the winter season 2012/13 with substantial virus circulation in our study population.",

Although, due to our study design, there may be a bias to ILI cases during periods of influenza A and B virus circulation, our findings are in concordance with other studies, in which ILI was described for the majority or all of influenza C infected patients [21,27]. Bronchitis or bronchiolitis was not reported for any patient, but one child (infected also with an influenza A virus) presented with symptoms of pneumonia. However, the proportion of pneumonia in our influenza C-positive samples does not differ considerably from that of our complete sample collection of this age group spanning the years 1999 to 2017 (data not shown). In our ambulant setting, we thus do not see an indication for an accumulation of lower respiratory tract disease in influenza C infected patients, but an influenza-like clinical presentation is common.",

In these cases, the cause for ILI symptoms cannot clearly be attributed to influenza C. Yet, we used qPCR assays with comparable performance characteristics (LOD and efficiency), so that a comparison of the obtained Cq values can be semiquantitatively interpreted for the different pathogens within one sample. In our study, the majority of co-infected samples (6/11; 54.5%) exhibited the highest viral load for influenza C, including the pneumonia case for whom it was ca 10,000-fold higher than that of influenza A at the time point and the sample site examined. In four samples, the influenza C Cq was close to the detection limit (\u2265 35) and thus influenza C was presumably of minor relevance. Repetitive sampling from the same patients and continuous parallel assessment of the patients clinical presentation could clarify the role of the single pathogens in the disease course, but is not included in our routine influenza surveillance system. Therefore, we cannot judge on the temporal dynamics of virus replication and the clinical impact of each virus detected.",

We almost exclusively detected C/Sao Paulo lineage viruses, and only two C/Kanagawa viruses were identified. Our C/Sao Paulo sequences add to both lineage subclades described by Matsuzaki et al. and represented by C/Aichi/1/99 and C/Victoria/2/2012 [30]. A total of 11 sequences (9 complete, 2 incomplete) group into the C/Aichi/1/99 subclade and were sampled between March 2012 and April 2013, while three additional sequences (2 complete, 1 incomplete) group into the C/Victoria/2/2012 subclade and were sampled between November 2012 and March 2013. Thus, viruses of both subclades co-circulated during the 2012/13 winter season. In contrast, the two C/Kanagawa lineage viruses were sampled in March 2012 and April 2014, thus outside of the period with increased infection rates. They form a distinct cluster within the C/Kanagawa clade, most closely related to C/Miyagi/9/96. Both C/Kanagawa viruses are almost identical to each other showing a nt homology of 99.1%, although they were sampled with a 2-year distance. Their closest neighbour, C/Miyagi/9/96 even has a homology of 99.5% and 99.3% on the nt level. This further supports the described genetic stability of this virus type compared with influenza A and B viruses [30], possibly also reflecting their antigenic properties.",

We found influenza C in a proportion of samples that was in accordance with previous reports. An increased and widespread virus circulation was observed during the winter and spring months of 2012/13, with viruses predominantly belonging to C/Aichi/1/99 subclade of C/Sao Paulo lineage viruses. Infected patients showed symptoms of ILI including upper as well as lower respiratory tract infection, although its association to the observed clinical symptoms remain uncertain in the majority of cases due to the identified co-infections. Further knowledge is needed about the virus epidemiology, its transmission patterns, its role in sole and mixed infections as well as the associated disease burden, especially in young children and patients with lower respiratory tract disease.",
