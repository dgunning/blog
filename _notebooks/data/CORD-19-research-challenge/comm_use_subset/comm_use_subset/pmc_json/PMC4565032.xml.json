The scope of metagenomics/metatranscriptomics is broad and includes the analysis of a diverse set of samples such as gut microbiome (Minot et al., 2011; Qin et\nal., 2010), environmental (Mizuno et\nal., 2013) or clinical (McMullan et\nal., 2012; Negredo et\nal., 2011; Willner et\nal., 2009) samples. Among these applications, the discovery of viral pathogens is clearly relevant for clinical practice (Chiu, 2013; Fancello et\nal., 2012). The traditional process of characterizing a virus through potentially difficult and time consuming culture techniques is being revolutionized by advances in high throughput sequencing. Potential benefits of sequence driven methodologies include a more rapid turnaround time (Quail et\nal., 2012), combined with a largely unbiased approach in species detection, including the opportunity for unexpected discoveries.",

Part of the difficulty stems from the read length limitation of existing deep DNA-sequencing technologies, an issue compounded by the extensive level of homology across viral and bacterial species. Another complication is the divergence of the microbial DNA sequences from the publicly available references. As a consequence, the assignment of a sequencing read to a database organism is often unclear. Last, the number of reads originating from a disease causing pathogen can be low (Barzon et\nal., 2013). The pathogen contribution to the mixture depends on the biological context, the timing of sample extraction and the type of pathogen considered. Therefore, highly sensitive computational approaches are required.",

A related but distinct question concerns the set of species which should be included in the mixture model. This question is closely related to the biological question of asking what species are present in the mixture. Including all species flagged as potential matches by the read classification can introduce a large number of species, often in the low thousands. Mixture models will then identify a large number of species at low levels. This interpretation is appropriate in some applications. In many other cases, the expectation is that the underlying species set should be parsimonious and that some divergence with database species or sequencing errors can explain a large fraction of the non matching reads.",

Even with a relatively small number of species to consider, the number of subsets of this space that could explain the mixture grows exponentially. Efficient computational strategies are required to make this problem tractable. Here we show that this inference can be achieved for modern scale metagenomics datasets. Our strategy is based on parallel tempering, a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) technique, using parallel computing to speed up the inference. We implemented these ideas in a user friendly R package called metaMix. metaMix produces posterior probabilities for various models as well as the relative abundances under each model.

Marginal likelihood comparison has a central role in comparing different models {M1,\u2026,Mm}. To compute the marginal likelihood P(X|Mk) for the mixture model Mk one has to average over the parameters with respect to the prior distribution \u03c0(\u03b8k|Mk), where \u03b8k are the model parameters:\n(4)P(X|Mk)=\u222b\u03b8kP(X|\u03b8k,Mk)\u03c0(\u03b8k|Mk)d\u03b8k\nThe posterior probability of the model Mk is:\n(5)P(Mk|X)\u221dP(X|Mk)P(Mk)\nwhere P(Mk) is the prior belief we hold for each model. The prior can be specified depending on the context but the basis of our interpretation is that parsimonious models with a limited number of species are more likely. Thus, in this Bayesian framework, our default prior uses a penalty limiting the number of species in the model, i.e P(Mk)=penalty(number of species in Mk). We approximate this penalty factor based on a user-defined parameter r that represents the species read support required by the user to believe in the presence of this species. We compute the logarithimic penalty value as the log-likelihood difference between two models: model Munknown which is our starting point when we have no knowledge about which species are present and therefore all N reads come from the \u2018unknown\u2019 category (pij=10\u22126) and model Mr where r reads have a perfect match to a species (pij = 1) and the remaining N\u2212r reads belong to the \u2018unknown\u2019 category: log\u2061penalty=log\u2061P(Munknown|X)\u2212log\u2061P(Mr|X). For DNA sequence analysis, the pij probabilities for the r reads originating from this unspecified species are approximated by 1/(median genome length in the reference database).

Additionally there were 67 K reads assigned to Human enteric coronavirus strain 4408. The presence of both viruses in the results indicated that even though the virus in the sample was mostly similar to hcov-oc 43, there were sequences sharing higher similarity to 4408 at some loci. This is highlighting how the database choice impacts the results: the RefSeq database we used has only one hcov-oc43 strain, while in GenBank there are several, capturing the high mutation rates of this species. We followed up on the sequences assigned to the \u2018unknown category\u2019, looking for nucleotide similarity with nr-nt using BLASTn. Half of the reads originated from an untranslated region of the Coronavirus genome, which is not captured by the protein reference database. The remaining reads matched confidently to either zebrafish or chicken sequences, two organisms whose proteins are not in the human microbiome reference we are using. These matches were explained as barcode leakage resulting from multiplexing on the same flowcell zebrafish and chicken RNA-Seq libraries. metaMix appropriately assigned these reads to the \u2018unknown\u2019 category, producing a clean probabilistic summary (Supplementary Table S2). The method ran in 4.7 h. The presence of the coronavirus was confirmed using RT-PCR. In this instance, the metaMix results emphasize the importance of being able to deal with missing reference sequences that do not have a closely related strain or species in the same database.",

A key feature of the method is that it provides probabilities that answer pertinent biological questions, in particular the posterior probability for the presence of a species in the mixture.

As a consequence, it also produces more accurate relative abundance estimates for the species in the mixture. The method can deal with either unassembled reads or assembled contigs or both, allowing for flexibility of choice for the bioinformatics preprocessing. In practice, the choice of bioinformatics processing prior to the application of our Bayesian mixture analysis must be optimized for each application, and our processing pipeline has been designed with viral sequence identification from transcriptome sequencing as a main goal. Nevertheless, as demonstrated by our analysis of the mock bacterial community dataset, the method can be applied in other contexts.",

For the datasets presented here, the computation time remained manageable and did not exceed a few hours, using 12 cores to run 12 parallel chains. Nevertheless, a limitation of metaMix is the increased processing time for very large datasets. Speed related improvements can be implemented in scenarios where the species ambiguity concerns only a small proportion of the read set. Reads with certain assignments can be flagged prior to the MCMC exploration of the state-space. Their assignment information can then be carried forward, thereby reducing the size of the similarity matrix used as input by the mixture model. Another area of possible improvement is MCMC convergence determination. The current version of metaMix produces log-likelihood traceplots allowing the user to visually inspect the MCMC convergence; however, additional diagnostic criteria can be implemented in future versions. Finally, consideration of the differences between mismatches, especially on the amino-acid level could lead to more accurate estimation of the pij probabilities. Such information is captured by the BLASTx similarity score. This metric could thus be used for probability estimation, instead of the number of mismatches.",
