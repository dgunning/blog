The gene order of hPIV-2 is 3\u2019-(leader)-NP-V/P-M-F-HN-L-(trailer)-5\u2019. All genes of hPIV-2 were sequenced by our group [2,3,4,5,6,7]. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were made by Tsurudome, and antigenic diversity of clinical isolates was investigated [8]. The infectious hPIV-2 from cDNA clone was constructed by Kawano, and it was shown that its growth property was the same as that of hPIV-2 [9].",

Legume lectins can be divided into five groups according to the specificity of the sugar-binding site: fucose (fuc)-specific, N-acetyl glucosamine/glucosamine (GlcNAc/Glc) specific, Glucose/mannose (Glc/Man) specific, Galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine (Gal/GalNAc) specific, and those that do not bind to any mono-saccharides [12]. Plant lectins have been shown to inhibit the infection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [13,14,15] and cytomegalovirus [13,14]. Plant lectins were reported to inhibit HIV by the prevention of virus adsorption to the cells [16]. However, they also prevent fusion of HIV with their target cells [13,14]. Against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, the mannose binding lectins are the most effective [17]. Recently, Change et al. reported that recombinant chimeric lectins consisting of mannose-binding lectins and L-ficolin are potent inhibitors of influenza A virus [18].",

Virus RNA was prepared and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Virus protein expression was observed by indirect immunofluorescence study using mAbs against NP, F and HN proteins of hPIV-2 [8]. The inhibitory effect of lectins on hPIV-2 entry into the cells and replication in the cells was analyzed using a recombinant green fluorescence protein-expressing hPIV-2 without matrix (M) protein (rghPIV-2\u0394M) [9]. The number of viruses released from infected cells cultured with the lectins was determined. The binding of lectins to the cells was observed using rhodamine-labeled lectins. The effects of the lectins on actin microfilaments and microtubules were analyzed using rhodamine phalloidin and anti-tubulin \u03b1 mAb, respectively.",

The number of base pairs between forward and reverse primers of NP, F and HN genes was about 800. There are some non-specific bands, some larger and some smaller than 800, and they were also observed faintly in negative control (Figure 2, lanes 1, 2 and 3), and in positive control (Figure 2, lanes 4, 5 and 6). Unexpectedly, ConA almost completely inhibited the synthesis of the NP gene (Figure 2, lane 7), and LCA (Figure 2, lane 10) and PNA (Figure 2, lane 13) largely inhibited NP gene synthesis. However, the syntheses of F (Figure 2, lane 8) and HN (Figure 2, lane 9) genes of hPIV-2 were not inhibited by Con A. Also, F (Figure 2, lane 11) and HN (Figure 2, lane 12) gene syntheses were not inhibited by LCA. PNA did not inhibit the syntheses of F (Figure 2, lane 14) and HN (Figure 2, lane 15) gene. It is difficult to explain the reason why only NP gene synthesis was largely inhibited by the three lectins according to the present understanding of paramyxovirus genome RNA synthesis [1].",

Figure 4C is a positive control: there are many multinucleated giant cells which have strong fluorescence, indicating that rghPIV-2\u0394M infected the cells, replicated in the cells and caused cell-to-cell infection. Figure 4D, E and F show the infected cells cultured with Con A, LCA and PNA, respectively. As shown in Figure 4, in several parts of the specimen of the infected cells cultured with the lectins, some positive cells were seen, and around them, many uninfected cells were observed.

            "text": "Plant lectins are known to bind to the cell surface sugar moieties, and inhibit virus adsorption to the cells [17]. Mannose- and N-acetylglucosamine-specific agglutinins on HIV replication have been reported [13,14]. In addition, it was reported that these lectins were effective on cytomegalovirus [13,14] and that recombinant chimeric lectins inhibited influenza A virus [18]. These plant lectins inhibited virus replication by preventing virus adsorption to the cells. For SARS-coronavirus, the mannose-specific lectins are highly effective, but the inhibitory mechanism is different from that for other viruses. SARS-coronavirus has high-mannose type glycans and the mannose-specific plant lectins can bind to the glycans and prevent the attachment of the virus to the cells [17]. In the present investigation, we analyzed the effect of three legume lectins that have different sugar-binding specificities on the growth of hPIV-2, whose receptor consists of sialic acids [1]. The three lectins bind to each cell receptor, but not to the sialic acids which are the receptor for hPIV-2, so the prevention of hPIV-2 adsorption to the cells must be non-specific. The lectins that bound to the sugar moieties of cell surface might prevent the binding of hPIV-2 by steric hindrance, not by competition. The cytoskeletons were important for virus entry and replication in cells. Actin is necessary for murine leukemia virus entry into cells [21] and for transcription/replication of measles virus [22] and hPIV-3 [10]. Tubulin is also a factor necessary for the synthesis of Sendai virus and vesicular stomatitis virus RNAs [11]. In the present experiment, Con A and LCA induced a slight morphology change in both actin microfilaments and microtubules, indicating that these may be one possibility of reduction of the numbers of the virus released from the infected cells. Taken together, the lectins mainly act on virus entry by considerable prevention of virus binding to the cells.",
