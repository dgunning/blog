Recently, novel viruses such as influenza A H7N9 variants [3, 4] and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [5, 6] have been discovered. Both of these cases exemplify the importance of continued surveillance for new pathogens, due to the risk of outbreaks or epidemics. Furthermore, viral infections are believed to cause approximately 15\u201320% of human cancers [7]. The known oncogenic viruses belong to highly divergent virus genera and include human papillomaviruses (HPVs), hepatitis B and C virus, Epstein-Barr virus, Merkel cell polyomavirus, human T cell-lymphotropic virus type-1 and Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma herpesvirus [8, 9]. As the etiology of many cancers is still unknown, it is not unlikely that yet unidentified oncogenic viruses exist that infect humans, and it is therefore important that methods for the discovery of novel viruses are continually developed and improved.",

In contrast to bacterial ribosomal DNA [10], no common genetic marker exists among viral genomes that ensure detection of all genetic variants including novel genera or species [11, 12]. Traditionally, viruses have been discovered using immunochemical methods, electron microscopy and cell culture. Molecular methods such as PCR and microarrays have been employed more recently [13\u201316]. However, most sensitive molecular methods are also highly specific, and require prior knowledge of the target sequence. The lack of a common viral genetic marker makes viral discovery difficult, and even the detection of novel subtypes can be challenging [11, 12].",

One simple approach is shotgun sequencing where sequencing libraries are prepared from all available sample DNA and/or RNA present in a sample.

Furthermore, the genome size of viruses is also significantly smaller than the host genome. Consequently, extensive shotgun sequencing may be necessary for detection of viral targets.",

Virion nucleic acid enrichment by physical removal of host material may be combined with subsequent specific amplification of target nucleic acids either before or after preparation of the sequencing libraries [14, 17\u201319]. Virion enrichment utilizes the characteristic that viral genomes are protected by protein capsids, and for some viruses also a lipid envelope. Centrifugation of homogenized samples followed by filtration removes host cells and cellular debris. Leftover unprotected host nucleic acids can be removed with nucleases, theoretically leaving only enriched encapsidated viral DNA and RNA for extraction [20, 21]. Furthermore, target enrichment may be obtained by hybridization of specific probes to the viral target DNA/RNA [15, 22] or capture of host material using specific probes for subtractive hybridisation [23]. However, the use of such methods requires some knowledge to the sequences of the target and can thus be biased.",

For decreasing concentrations of target, we compared the effect of virion enrichment. To mimic the complexity of a biological sample, test sample material was generated containing different types of virions and/or infected human cells, spiked to a pool of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). To represent some of the diversity between viral families, we included viruses with either DNA or RNA genomes, non-enveloped viruses, proviruses integrated into the human genome in single or multiple copies per genome, plasmid DNA, as well as armored RNA (aRNA). An important aspect of this investigation was to determine the level of enrichment compared to the need of sequencing depth in shotgun sequencing. Each sample was split in four fractions of which two were used for shotgun sequencing of total DNA or RNA. The remaining two fractions were subjected to virion enrichment, and libraries were prepared on virion-associated DNA or RNA, from here on referred to as virion-enriched libraries (Fig 1).",

As the host RNA was not quantifiable, the proportion of expected viral reads could not be predicted. Under the assumption that the amount of total RNA was equal for all samples, the expected proportion of viral reads was instead calculated relative to the observed number of viral reads for the sample with the highest concentration of the given virus and normalised to the total number of reads. Table 4 lists the expected and the observed proportion of reads for each virus for each sample. In most cases the observed proportion of viral reads exceeded the predicted proportion.",

The relevant libraries were all negative for viral sequences when tested in sensitive target-specific qPCR, suggesting that laboratory inter-sample contamination was unlikely. Furthermore, extensive shotgun sequencing of samples not sharing lanes (>1.4\u00d7108 reads) showed no indications of contamination. Together this argues that the reads appear as an artefact of misreading of clusters or indexes during sequencing of several samples per lane. It has been shown that low numbers of contaminating reads can be extremely difficult to avoid. In a carefully controlled study up to 5000 parts per million (ppm) of all indexed reads were misinterpreted during Illumina sequencing, contributed also by carry-over of indexes during laboratory handling, or manufacturing of oligonucleotides [43]. Here, the observed level of artefact sequences range between 0.48\u201348 ppm (Table 5), which is probably to be expected when processing samples containing high virus concentrations together with negative controls. In this study all negative samples producing viral reads, were sequenced together with the sample with the highest concentration of those particular viruses.

We speculate that this resistance is caused by super-coiling which could explain the low number of reads detected by DNA shotgun sequencing.

In any sample the concentration of viral RNA would expectedly be very low. Before preparation of RNA shotgun libraries the extracted nucleic acids were digested with DNase, and thus underwent two purification steps prior to cDNA synthesis, using silica columns, both of which lead to a loss of material. Likewise, the fraction used for virion-enriched RNA libraries was nuclease-digested prior to extraction, during which some loss of RNA may occur. Subsequent DNase treatment prior to RNA library preparation was initially attempted, but omitted as the resulting DNA concentrations were too low to support library preparation.",

For total DNA libraries, the NEBNext E6070 was selected for its ability to include large amounts of DNA, increasing library complexity and the possibility to obtain viral reads. All RNA libraries were prepared using ScriptSeq v2. It was difficult to estimate the potential impact of the different library kits. A place to look for differences could be the fragment lengths of the prepared libraries. The fragment lengths within the RNA libraries were approximately the same fluctuating between 150 and 500 bp with an average length of 350 bp. For the shotgun DNA libraries the fragment length within the libraries varied between 150 bp and 1000 bp. The same applied to the virion-enriched libraries; however, they tended to peak at around 200 bp, where the shotgun library fragment lengths were evenly distributed and thus in general longer than the virion-enriched libraries. This could indicate a small difference in the performance of the kits, however we assume this difference was negligible. Even though the lengths varied between the two types of DNA libraries, the applied kits provided the optimal conditions for viral discovery and thereby provided the best foundation for assessing the effect of virion enrichment.",

When preparing libraries using the ScriptSeq kit, RNA is initially primed by random hexamers during cDNA synthesis.

The results showed that enrichment of virion-associated DNA was successful and typically increased viral target sequences by three orders of magnitude. For the virion-associated RNA, viral target reads was increased up to 13 fold. The viral concentration seemed to have limited effect on the degree of DNA or RNA enrichment (Fig 4). Hall et al., 2013 [27] has previously characterized the effects of virion-enrichment on viral targets, using an enrichment approach similar to ours, with centrifugation, filtration and nuclease treatments. They showed that HAdV copynumbers were not affected by their enrichment treatments but that EV copynumbers were reduced 100 fold by enrichment procedures. The sequencing of EV yielded a 20-fold increase compared to samples that were not subjected to enrichment procedures, which is similar to what we detected. The 100 fold decrease in EV copynumber, could explain the lower increase in viral sequences observed for EV compared to HAdV in this study.",
