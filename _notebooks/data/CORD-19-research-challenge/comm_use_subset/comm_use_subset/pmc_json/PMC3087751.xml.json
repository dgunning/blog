            "text": "Instantaneous heart rate in response to physiological perturbations often exhibits remarkable oscillations at multiple time scales. These oscillations, known as heart rate variability (HRV), are mainly mediated by the autonomic nervous system via parasympathetic and sympathetic innervations. Analysis of HRV has been suggested to reveal subtle patterns of heart rate dynamics that are relevant to the underlying physiological state and autonomic nervous system function [1]. Prior studies have shown that HRV measures are highly heritable traits that can be used to support genetic association and linkage studies [2], [3], [4], [5]. Family and twin studies have shown a significant genetic influence on a variety of HRV measures [6], [7]. Genetic polymorphisms related to cardiovascular functions have been associated with altered HRV [8], [9], [10], [11]. Recently, we have also made progress in identifying variations in two genes related to neuropsychiatric function that are associated with altered heart rate dynamics in samples of healthy adult and elderly subjects: those encoding brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) [12] and apolipoprotein E [13], respectively.",

Specifically, heart rate dynamics is a phenotypic \u201cexpression\u201d of the autonomic nervous system, so comparing similar heart rate oscillation phenotypes among individuals may reveal a global profile of autonomic function relevant to genetic variants. With these considerations in mind, in the present study, we introduce a bottom-up genotype\u2013phenotype analysis to investigate the association between genetic polymorphisms and autonomic control of heart rate dynamics, using three common polymorphisms in genes encoding \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-AR) as an example.",

Activation of \u03b21-AR provides strong stimulus to increase the frequency and contractility of the heart, whereas the activation of \u03b22-AR results in smooth muscle relaxation and increased cardiac output with less extent compared to \u03b21-AR. Thus, the connection between \u03b2-AR and HRV is plausible and warrants evaluations. Limited evidences suggest that variations in genes coding subtypes of \u03b2-AR may be associated with heart rate or HRV. For example, Ser49Gly polymorphism in \u03b21-AR gene has been found to be associated with resting heart rate [14], [15], and an association of \u03b22-AR gene polymorphisms with spectral components of HRV measures has been reported in a relatively small healthy adult male sample [11].",

The IBS method is based on rank-order frequency analysis of acceleration/deceleration patterns of heart rate fluctuation. Because stimulus of \u03b2-AR results in acceleration of heart rate, the functional changes in genetic polymorphisms of \u03b2-AR may affect acceleration/deceleration patterns of heart rate, which can be detected by the IBS method. The analyses of the present study were two-fold: 1) a non-randomness index [17] derived from the IBS method was applied to quantify the nonlinear aspect of HRV according to \u03b2-AR genotype and to test the correlation of this index with standard HRV indices; and 2) using agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis, we unsupervisedly categorized these subjects into clusters based on pairwise dissimilarity among heart rate dynamics, and then we investigated the association of these clustering patterns with \u03b2-AR gene polymorphisms. We show that this bottom-up, categorization approach combining the IBS method and hierarchical cluster analysis can detect subgroups of subjects based on phenotypes that are associated with \u03b2-AR gene polymorphisms.",

The resulting spectra were then processed with SpectroTYPER (Sequenom). All samples were genotyped for eight unrelated SNPs for DNA quality examination. The samples were diluted onto 96-well plates, and only the plates on which each of the eight unrelated SNPs had a successful genotyping rate greater than 95% were used for further study.

Briefly, time domain measures of HRV include the mean heart rate and standard deviation of the normal interbeat intervals (SDNN), the root mean square successive difference between adjacent normal interbeat intervals (RMSSD), and the percentage of adjacent intervals that varied by greater than 50 ms (pNN50) [20]. The SDNN assesses the overall variability of interbeat intervals. The RMSSD and pNN50 measure the short-term variation of interbeat intervals, which is mainly modulated by parasympathetic innervation [21]. Standard spectral HRV measures [19] include high-frequency power (HF; 0.15\u20130.40 Hz), low-frequency power (LF; 0.04\u20130.15 Hz), and very low-frequency power (VLF; 0.003\u20130.04 Hz). LF power is suggested to be modulated by both sympathetic and parasympathetic activities, whereas HF power is mainly modulated by parasympathetic activity [22], [23]. The LF/HF ratio is considered a measure of the shift of sympathovagal balance toward sympathetic activity [19], [24]. The physiological mechanism underlying VLF power is disputed but has been suggested to be mediated partly by the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system or parasympathetic modulation [19], [25], [26].",

In the present study, sample entropy was calculated using a pattern length (m) of 2 and a similarity factor (r) of 0.15. The sum of sample entropy over all scale factors from 1 to 20 was computed to represent the overall MSE measure.

The non-randomness index is independent of conventional entropic measures (i.e., sample entropy or approximate entropy) and has been evaluated in other studies [17], [45], [46], [47]. The calculation of the non-randomness index is based on estimating the average n-tuple distance between raw interbeat interval time series and its randomly shuffled surrogates using the IBS method, where the number of surrogates was 100 in the present study. The averaged non-randomness index derived from each n-tuple non-randomness index (n = 2\u201310) was then used in this study for comparisons among \u03b2-AR genotypes.",

The IBS method was not exclusively developed for the analysis of heartbeat sequence but also for other generic datasets consisting of repetitive elements [42], [43]. With an appropriate mapping rule that is meaningful to a target dataset, the IBS method can be applied to other types of phenotypic data derived from the time series [16]. Second, we employed a visually aided hierarchical analysis by a software tool called a generalized association map, which enables a bottom-up approach to unsupervisedly identify heart rate clusters to study genotype\u2013phenotype associations.

            "text": "Strength of this work include a larger sample size, matched gender distribution, and long recording of ECG signals using a Holter recorder, compared to prior genetic association study of HRV. Several limitations influence the interpretation of the findings presented in this study. First, we are unable to repeat findings of spectral HRV indices seen in a smaller male sample [11]. This may be due to different gender distributions [57] and means of ECG recording. Twenty-four hour Holter recording could validate and reinforce the association of \u03b2-AR genetic polymorphism with HRV seen in this study. Second, we were unable to evaluate the correlation of the non-randomness index with other commonly used sympathetic indicators, such as blood pressure or plasma catecholamine levels. Third, our findings are based on a healthy population and may not be generalizable to medically ill patients, such as those with cardiovascular diseases. The cross-sectional nature of our study also limited us examining the age modification of the effect of \u03b2-AR receptor polymorphism on autonomic function.",
