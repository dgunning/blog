Current challenges in diagnosis of Ebola by frontline and airport surveillance systems underscored the existing detection and diagnostic tools, and highlighted the importance of combining diagnostic needs with appropriate technologies. The need for rapid, accurate, inexpensive, and robust diagnostic low-detection thresholds can be met by recent advances in genomics, proteomics, and material science; profitable public-private partnerships; and sustainable profits in low-resource settings. The continued development and deployment of efficient, low-cost diagnostic platforms is essential for containment. Detection methods suitable to local/international standard laboratories or sentinel for imported cases epidemiology must be validated prior to transition from malaria sustained prevention and control programs and interventions. The importance of developing and implementing sensitive diagnostic approaches to accurately quantify and monitor Ebola reservoirs is imperative in curbing the persistent transmission dynamics, and preventing, controlling, and containing the disease given Africa\u2019s engagement in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and in the London Declaration International Health Regulations (2005), the Universal Human Rights Declaration, and the New Partnership for African\u2019s Development (NEPAD) in Africa. However, a number of challenges remain to be overcome before deployment of rapid, low-cost, sensitive, and specific point-of-care disease diagnostics become a reality.\n\u25cf Spot frontline and airport surveillance using laser imaging of febrile conditions with a latency period of 2\u201321 days for clinical manifestations require rethinking, more research, and funding for the development of simple, rapid, field adaptable, and effective detection tools in asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic cases, to be used in addition to spot airport passengers\u2019 diagnostic kit(s).\u25cf Immune variability across African countries with syndemics is poorly understood, although it is believed that populations develop varied degrees of acquired/partial to complete immunity resulting from repeated exposure to infectious diseases, and can carry a certain load of virus for months or years before it becomes a clinical manifestation of the Ebola disease [4, 18]. The concept of immunization or vaccination as described by Edward Jenner (1749\u20131823) observed that people with cowpox infection developed immunity to smallpox, with several lifelong survivors. Hence, smallpox was declared eradicated in the wild in 1980 after a worldwide immunization campaign took place similar to the ongoing polio eradication with effective immunity response to outbreak depending on the age and level of individual antibodies (cell-mediated immunity) and protective threshold. Consequently, large asymptomatic population-animal reservoirs in the case of the Ebola infection in Africa may not be surprising, and further screening of Ebola exposed and non-exposed populations is required. What are the lessons and challenges learned in shaping future research priorities? This makes the need for in-depth knowledge on the exposure of viral infectious (e.g., measles, yellow fever, chickenpox, or HIV/AIDS) even more urgent as this can contribute to Ebola resurgence and the quest for an Ebola vaccine [4].\u25cf Genetic and clinical variability have shown that genetic make-up or traits vary from one ethnic group to another, and within and between populations with different clinical manifestations, but the relationship between population genetic changes and Ebola seroconversion and progression over time and space is still poorly understood. The precise role and efficacy of biosurveillance in public health has yet to be determined, as well as the limitations of SS systems to detect Ebola infection or other outbreaks. Health professionals should continuously aspire to accurately diagnose and treat patients, as well as to identify public health outbreaks or emergencies, combined with adequate local integration of infrastructure, facilities, and capacity building.\u25cf Environment, ecological, and animal interface, and encroachment factors due to landscape use and misuse, mining, deforestation, forest degradation, wildfire, conflicts/wars, and man and animal interactions also require further research.",

These challenges include: insufficient regional and international political commitment, insufficient resources and funding, lack of an Ebola vaccine or drug, detection and diagnostic limitations, and a lack of resources or infrastructure to support such activities. Additional challenges include inadequacies in programs and approaches, weak or nonexistent primary healthcare infrastructure, poor access to health facilities, and a lack of effective mental, traumatic or neurological assessment tools, as well as national and regional functioning early-warning alert and surveillance response systems. Other associated factors include social media and web-based information and communication; an artificial country colonial landscape demarcation and barriers amongst African countries with cross-border families; marriage; employment and commercial/trading activities; sociocultural realities and practices; attitudes to care seeking and utilization; environmental and ecological risk factors; human-animal migration and movement dynamics; conflicts/wars and violence in the region; intense mining activities in the region with an associated impact on the political sphere; and the socioeconomic, ecological, and epidemiologic impact of Ebola and others infectious and chronic diseases.3.Acquired or partial immunity of local populations",

Evaluating \u2018acquired immunity\u2019 may improve outbreak estimates when evaluating the risk of microbial illness from food or environmental exposures. This suggests that some current approaches may significantly overestimate their role in causing such illnesses. Immune status is a major factor in susceptibility to disease outbreak, and the impact of acquired immunity to a pathogen needs careful insight when assessing the potential health risks of outbreaks and other infectious diseases of different sources of exposure, including (1) low-frequency, low-dose exposure (recreational water); (2) low-frequency, high-dose exposure (consumption of raw chicken liver); (3) high-frequency, low-dose exposure (direct contact with sheep and goats, i.e., farmers); and (4) high-frequency, high-dose exposure (visiting petting zoos, wildlife hunters or bush meat sellers/consumers). The public health community should also take acquired immunity into account in order to improve estimates of the potential impacts of infectious diseases and to assist in preventing and managing outbreaks. Further studies to better characterize and quantify the effects of acquired immunity on Ebola outbreaks are also needed. In humans, there may be apparent ecological, ethnic susceptibility and geographical landscape variations, but it is always important to disentangle such factors\u2014as well as climate, nutrition, environmental, and economics drivers\u2014from those that might be genetically determined in both animal and human transmission dynamics.4.Reservoirs of Ebola virus carriers in both humans and animals",

Viral infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, hepatitis coupled with malaria, tuberculosis, and other neglected and emerging infectious diseases are rampant in Africa [6]. Assessment of transmissibility requires tools that can accurately identify the various developmental stages of the animal-human and/or human-human interphases. Moreover, in most epidemic areas, asymptomatic carriers are not uncommon and, as potential carriers, represent a significant reservoir for Ebola transmission regardless of successful local interventions. These are the challenges to the current humanitarian and national prevention, control, and containment programs [19]. Many of these asymptomatic infections may be present at densities below the limit for microscopic and rapid diagnostic tests threshold detection and thus lead to underestimation persistence of the epidemic burden and probably resurgence.",

            "text": "Although SS response systems are able to detect Ebola outbreaks earlier than traditional surveillance, it will be more efficient for these systems to prepare for the standard operational protocol to avoid unexpected occurrences of events. Therefore, we recommended the strengthening of the following activities in order to improve the frontline and airport SS responses to Ebola outbreaks:Improving case investigation, tracking of susceptible populations, and quarantine periodMost African countries are challenged by insufficient or nonexistent facilities, a lack of qualified personnel, and the vicious cycle of poverty. Cultural practices and myths, challenges in African traditional and alternative medicine implementation in healthcare systems, and attitudes towards health seeking should also be noted. The poor landscape mapping, rural and urban town planning, and especially the poor or nonexistent accessible roads to these communities are other contributing factors. Tracking can be very difficult in areas with poor documentation habits, lack of appropriate reporting or a contact tracing system, uncontrolled migration and population movement across borders, unlimited cross-border marriages and trade, as well as animal in- and out-flow of foreigners at the entrance or departure terminuses (airport) in Africa and elsewhere. The porous nature of West African country borders stresses the need for automated robust, high-sense human and animal health and movement detectors, in partnership with communities and governments so appropriate data can be collected to answer essential Ebola questions. Public health surveillance and powerful analytical tools are needed to accurately interpret the findings.The strengthening of the epidemiological capacity through surveillance response systems at the local level needs to be advocated in order to inform the interpretation of syndromic findings in light of \u201clocal epidemiological peculiarities,\u201d as well as to ensure a rapid response to syndromic alerts. Under enabling conditions, community-based mobilization and empowerment in recognizing, informing and active case investigation and contact tracing could build strong relationships between public health and healthcare providers in effective early alert, prevention, control of current and future outbreaks. These relationships are critical for reliable and effective Emergency outbreak response and follow up epidemiological investigation, and for evidence policy-building regardless of the type of intervention [20, 21].Nurturing \u201cOne Health and One world\u201d surveillance and response systemsInfectious diseases primarily affecting animals can have direct and indirect impacts on humans including significant economic consequences. Two important factors can contribute to the proliferation of zoonotic diseases: the explosive growth of human and domestic animal populations, and the increasingly close physical proximity within which humans and domestic and wild animals live [6, 20]. Timely identification of current and future emerging microbial threats (on the order of SARS, the West Nile virus, and H5N1 avian influenza) will require an integrated international approach to disease surveillance. However, progress has been hampered by a variety of mining, environmental, climatic, socioeconomic, and political factors, in addition to a weak and fragile or nonexistent surveillance infrastructure and technology, and inadequate expertise in Africa.Success in Ebola control and containment requires a comprehensive and integrated strategy in human disease surveillance among the underserved populations that live in close contact with bat fruits, gorillas, and other wildlife animals. This strategy should incorporate capacity building, training, and empowerment of the local community by integrating simple data collection with basic laboratory diagnosis to identify the link between human outbreaks of the Ebola virus, and poaching, the consumption of bush meats, basic hygiene measures such as hand washing and cooking meat thoroughly, overall food safety in communities, and early warning of outbreaks in animals [20].Fostering integrated active surveillance response systemsIn view of the recognized potential of SS systems, there are many practical concerns about sensitivity and false-positive rate trade-offs and the time required to accumulate enough evidence of an outbreak to trigger a detection algorithm, as well as on the available control strategies of the local, national, and regional public health practice and utilization of these systems. The broad and multifaceted practices of surveillance approaches are used to monitor the progress and outcome of interventions to mitigate or stop the progression of an outbreak, including of economically and ecologically important animal or plant species and the transmission of zoonotic diseases among animal and human populations over space and time, as well as to predict future transmission patterns [20, 22]. Currently, disease outbreak surveillance and detection relies heavily on the astute individual: the clinician, the veterinarian, the grower, and the livestock manager noticing both routine and suspicious symptoms and bringing them to the attention of the public health or veterinary community including academics and zoological parks. Most developed countries have a surveillance system in place and the ability to detect and diagnose human and animal diseases. Innovations and strategies for the surveillance and detection of human and animal diseases, and assessing the resource needs and opportunities for improving and coordinating infectious disease surveillance, early detection, tracing, case investigation, prompt reporting, and management are needed in upholding health systems strengthening and future sustainable development in most under resourced countries [21, 22].Technological advances in disease surveillance and detection that have benefited public health surveillance such as rapid, automated, and sensitive biosensors; portable sampling and assay systems; and DNA-based diagnostic tools remain to be adapted to track animal diseases. Models and interventions incorporating M&E systems and true coordination and collaboration would enable optimal surveillance response, thereby driving policy and action, with a feedback process to facilitate continuous evolution and adaptation [20, 21]. Information would be drawn from a broad range of disciplines relevant to physical and mental health, as well as domestic and wild animal health and plant health, through the complementary processes of agent or disease surveillance and host and environmental monitoring with potential economic benefits of surveillance systems for all. Nevertheless, the release of surveillance information should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, as trust is not built by merely sharing data, but by helping people understand information that is context-specific. Active engagement to discuss the perception of risk of outbreak and identifying priorities for action is also essential. Community or regional active surveillance systems, new effective rapid diagnostic methods, and prompt reporting have the potential to advance infectious disease control and prevention efforts in Africa and elsewhere. Although, the Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-Based Epidemics (ESSENCE), operated by the Department of Defense, allows epidemiologists to track\u2014in real-time\u2014syndromes reported in daily data feeds from regional hospitals and clinics, it is yet to be actively implemented in most Africa countries.Due to the persistent outbreaks of infectious diseases across Africa, it is crucial to analyze the applicability of surveillance response systems in order to improve the ability of hospital/health center triage systems to identify and appropriately treat patients who show symptoms associated with an emerging infectious disease, a threat of an infectious disease (e.g., influenza, SARS, and Ebola, as well as potential bioterrorism agents such as anthrax and smallpox), or an emerging infectious disease. Laboratory diagnosis may be possible by building a network of information about early warning alert and response systems that travels up or down the public health hierarchy, from the local to the international level and vice versa [20\u201322].Shifting towards an effective public and global health paradigm",

Early detection is essential to control and contain the spread of the Ebola outbreak. A disease such as this\u2014in a profoundly interconnected world\u2014requires active vigilance for rapid recognition, and prompt diagnosis, case investigation, and tracking of its causes and sources, as well as the mitigation of reliable and robust strategies and resources for an appropriate and efficient response. This paper illuminates the major gaps in frontline and airport Ebola control and containment, and provides structured opportunities for leaders, governments, academia, industry, and stakeholders to more robustly mobilize and combine resources. We examine issues of shared concern regarding research, prevention, detection, and management of the Ebola outbreak and other emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.",
