It may lead to direct economic loss, and may cause both physical and psychological injuries, particularly in developing countries with limited availability of coping mechanisms [1]. China has been seriously affected by floods. For example, a severe flood that struck the Yangzi River of China in 1998 affected over 180 million people. According to the New Report from Ministry of Health of China in 1999, the flood displaced 18.393 million people, destroyed 6.85 million houses, caused 4,150 deaths and yielded a direct economic loss of about $32 billion. Dongting Lake, located south of the middle reach of the Yangzi River in Southern China, was one of the areas most affected by the floods. Hundreds of thousands of residents were homeless and many infrastructural and agricultural projects were also damaged, leaving survivors with some psychological problems, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).",

According to the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5), PTSD consists of four clusters of symptoms, namely intrusion, avoidance, negative alterations in cognition and mood, and hyper-arousal [2]. It has been estimated that the lifetime prevalence of PTSD in the general population is 1 % to 9 % [3]. Individuals with PTSD may experience a long recovery process after traumatic events [4]. For example, half of the police responders in the World Trade Center Health Registry with PTSD in 2003\u20132007 continued to have PTSD in 2011\u20132012 after the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001 [5]. In the past decades, researches on PTSD have mainly focused on PTSD after traumatic events like earthquakes [6\u20138], hurricanes [9\u201311], wars [12\u201315], and traffic accidents [16, 17]. Articles about PTSD after floods have been rarely reported [18\u201320], and none has reported the effect of social support on the recovery from PTSD.",

The SSRS consists of 10 items and three dimensions, namely objective support, subjective support and support utilization. The dimension of objective support has 3 items: \u201cI often live with my family members\u201d; \u201cI often get economic assistance from family members, relatives, friends, neighbors or others when faced with some economic difficulties\u201d; \u201cI often get consolation from family members, relatives, friends, neighbors or others when faced with some trouble.\u201d The dimension of subjective support contains 4 items: \u201cI can turn to my friends for help when things go wrong\u201d; \u201cI often communicate with my neighbors\u201d; \u201cI often communicate with my colleagues\u201d; and \u201cmy family will try their best to help me when things go wrong.\u201d The dimension of support utilization includes 3 items: \u201cI often seek assistance proactively when I have some difficulties\u201d; \u201cI often communicate with others about my distress\u201d; and \u201cI often participate in societal activity.\u201d Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale (1 = none, 2 = slight, 3 = moderate, 4 = great). The total scores of all these ten items are used to assess the current social support status of individuals. Based on the established guideline [25], social support scores are defined as low (\u226444) and high (>44); objective support scores are defined as low (\u226413) and high (>13); subjective support scores are defined as low (\u226424) and high (>24); support utilization scores are defined as low (\u22649) and high (>9). This tool was chosen because it had proved to have better reliability and validity [26]. For instance, the correlated coefficients between total scale and three subscales ranged from 0.724 to 0.835, while Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficients of total scale and subscales ranged from 0.825 to 0.896 [27].",

Overall, family members seem to be the first choice to provide any kind of social support and the support from one\u2019s spouse even plays an irreplaceable role in one\u2019s perceived social support [34]. Also, there was a higher level of subjective support in the elderly than in the young. However, the young showed a higher level of support utilization than the elderly. These observations could possibly result from the fact that the elderly have much wider social interactions than the young by virtue of their age, but it is also because of their age, they have not so many ways to utilize social support as the young. With the development of the social network connections, young people can make use of such tools to obtain social support, but it\u2019s relatively hard for the elderly to take advantage of these social network connections.",

A number of studies had proved that social support was associated with the onset of PTSD [14, 37\u201340], but it was unclear whether social support may influence the recovery from prior PTSD or not. The results of this follow-up study revealed that social support was positively correlated with the recovery from PTSD.

In this study, it was found that social support, subjective support and support utilization were significantly associated with current PTSD. After adjusting for the potential confounding variables by multivariate logistic regression analyses, the results did not change. Objective support was not significantly associated with current PTSD after adjusting for the potential confounding variables. Unlike the objective support, subjective support is more about the feeling of being supported. Subjective assessment of received social support has been reported to be a more powerful predictor of subsequent improvement in psychological disorders than objective measures of social support. This is the case because one\u2019s psychological perception of reality could affect individual\u2019s behavior and development [41, 42]. Although significant correlation between objective support and the recovery from prior PTSD was not found in this study, it was worth putting on record that objective support was also irreplaceable. Components of objective support, such as economic assistance and psychological intervention, often serve as the foundation for subjective support and support utilization. The reason for no significant relationship between objective support and the recovery from prior PTSD could be due to an even distribution of objective support to flood victims by local government or communities.",
