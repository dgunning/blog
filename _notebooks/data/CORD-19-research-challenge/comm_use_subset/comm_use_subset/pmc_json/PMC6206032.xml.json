            "text": "qRT-PCR is the premier molecular biological technique to define accurate expression profiles of selected genes of interest10,11. It is highly sensitive, specific and reproducible12,13 and acts as a key factor in the systems biology based studies where both quality control and validation are essential criteria11. The major concern in qRT-PCR is a suitable endogenous control/reference gene to nullify variations that arise in the due course of experiment14. The variation can be introduced at any step starting from RNA extraction to quantification of qRT-PCR in terms of quality and quantity15,16. Endogenous control genes are assumed to be constitutively and uniformly expressed within the samples to be compared, irrespective of experimental conditions or treatments and tissue differentiation14,17. Housekeeping genes are the most commonly used endogenous control genes. These genes are used as reference control genes to normalize the variations in the qRT-PCR experiment18,19. However, varying expression of housekeeping genes under different experimental conditions has been reported in viral infections10,20\u201327, cancer research14,21 and heat stress response in sheep22. The use of an invalidated reference gene in normalization leads to unreliable conclusions especially when used with tissue samples15,18,23. This warrants for a need to identify suitable reference gene(s) for normalization for every gene expression experiment to do away with the hurdles in qRT-PCR24. Sometimes, validated endogenous controls for the desired experimental conditions can be derived from the literature describing the similar type of experiment.",

Eradication of rinderpest (RP) has put PPR in spotlight to be the next eradicable disease due to similar nature of the causative agent28,29. PPR caused by Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) belongs to genus Morbillivirus of family Paramyxoviridae. It is known that virus infection (e.g. SARS corona virus, yellow fever virus, human herpes virus, cytomegalovirus etc.) often results in modified or fluctuating gene transcription patterns of conventionally used housekeeping genes30,31. Recently, GAPDH was identified to be the most suitable reference gene for evaluating the gene expression in PPRV infected goats PBMCs in vitro9. No published data is currently available on the use of specific reference gene(s) in goats and sheep infected with PPRV in vivo. RNA-Seq experiments are being carried out in our laboratory to identify specific host gene expressions signatures in goats and sheep under PPRV infection. The indiscriminate use of any endogenous control to validate the RNA\u2013Seq experiment may lead to erroneous conclusions. Therefore, in our study we used a panel of ten reference genes viz. GAPDH (Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), 18S rRNA (18S ribosomal RNA), B2M (\u03b2 2 microglobulin), HSP 90 (heat shock protein 90), ACAC-alpha (Acetyl coenzyme carboxylase alpha), HMBS (Hydroxymethylbilane synthase), YWHAZ (Tyrosine 3-monooxygenase activation protein zeta polypeptide), POLR2A (Polymerase32 II (DNA directed) polypeptide A), ACTB (beta actin) and HPRT1 (Hypoxanthin Phosphoribosyl transferase 1) in fourteen different tissues obtained from healthy and PPRV infected goats and sheep to identify the best possible reference gene(s) for qRT-PCR normalization. We recommend different sets of reference genes based on the experimental condition.",

Elucidation of molecular pathogenesis from global gene expression profile by high-throughput omics study ultimately ends up in a number of candidate genes. qRT-PCR provides the simplest platform for its validation. In spite of these facts, qRT-PCR requires a robust normalization of the data to overcome the variability introduced at any of the steps in an experiment42,43. An ideal reference gene should be stably expressed in tissues under varied experimental conditions. However, this constant expression of any reference gene only refers to a specific condition under certain environment and the expression level in different cell types and tissues significantly varies under different experimental systems41,44\u201346. Thus identification and validation of reference genes for expression studies in an experiment is widely supported and practiced23,47.",

The stability value (M) is calculated as the average pairwise variation of a specific gene compared with all other reference genes. Genes with the highest M values have the least stable expression. geNorm also identifies the number of reference genes required for the normalization of a particular experiment48. The NormFinder allows comparison of intra- and inter-group variation and calculates expression stability value (M)49,50. BestKeeper uses repeated pairwise correlation analysis to determine the optimal reference genes51. The comparative delta Ct method52 evaluates the average of standard deviation values derived from comparison of relative expression between a reference gene with other reference genes. The difference in ranking results obtained from different software programs in our study may be attributed to the use of different algorithms by different softwares to determine gene expression stability41,43,53. Most of the reports recommend consensus comprehensive ranking for use as best endogenous control41,43,53. Therefore, we recommend the candidate reference genes obtained through comprehensive ranking method in all the three different experimental conditions i.e. control, infected and combined. In control goats and control sheep, HMBS and HSP90, and HMBS and B2M are recommended as the most stable endogenous controls. These genes can be used as suitable reference genes in studies where basal expression of target genes across healthy tissues is compared in goats and sheep. In PPRV infected tissue studies for comparing across tissues, we recommend the use of HMBS and ACAC in goats and HMBS and HSP90 in sheep. In comparative studies of PPRV infected with uninfected tissues as a whole, we recommend the use of HMBS and B2M in goats and HMBS and HPRT1 in sheep, thus eliminating the use of multiple tissue specific endogenous controls. The purpose of the combined analysis was to demonstrate the stability of reference genes with respect to different conditions and tissues. We recommend to use that reference gene which shows highest stability in the combined groups for studies under PPRV infection.",

The protocols were approved vide letter no 387/CPCSEA. Apparently healthy, non-descriptive hill goats (local Rohilkhand breed) and sheep (Muzaffarnagri breed) between 6 months to 1 year of age were used in the present study. Virulent PPRV (Izatnagar/94- lineage IV, accession number KR140086.1)59 isolate was used as a challenge virus for infection. The tissue samples - upper lip, lower lip, tongue, trachea, lung, pre-scapular lymph node, mesenteric lymph node, spleen, liver, small intestine, large intestine, abomasum, caecum and rectum were collected from PPRV infected sheep and goats (n = 6 for each of the species). The counterpart healthy tissues were collected from apparently healthy animals (negative for PPRV antibody by competitive ELISA and serum neutralization test) housed separately. The apparently healthy animals are referred as control. These animals were handled in a humane manner and euthanized as per the CPCSEA guidelines.

ISG15 and IRF7 were chosen as the target genes of interest as these genes have been identified and predicted as important antiviral molecules by RNA\u2013sequencing data analysis of PPRV infection studies in our lab. Forward primer 5\u2032-CAGTTCATCGCCCAGAAGAT-3\u2032 and reverse primer 5\u2032-GTCGTTCCTCACCAGG ATGT-3\u2032 were used for ISG15. Similarly, for IRF7 5\u2032-GACACGCCCATCTTTGACTT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032- ACTGTCCAGGGAGGACACAC-3\u2032 were used as primers. The amplification efficiency was calculated from the standard curve generated by 7 point, 10 fold serial dilutions. The Ct values for control and infected tissue samples with two most stable endogenous control genes (HMBS and B2M in goats, and HMBS and HPRT1 in sheep) and two least stable endogenous control gene (ACTB and YWHAZ for goats and ACTB and POLR2A for sheep) were estimated. Expression for control and infected groups was represented by delta Ct value (Ct(target genes) \u2212 Ct(geometric mean of Ct of the two best endogenous control genes) or Ct(geometric mean of Ct of two least stable endogenous control genes)). t- test in GraphPad Prism 7 was used to compare the expression of ISG15 and IRF7 in infected relative to control.",
