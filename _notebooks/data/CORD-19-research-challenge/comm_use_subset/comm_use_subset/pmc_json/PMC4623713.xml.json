We identified significantly dysregulated GO BPs in the HTRs to each pathogen as well as enriched GO BPs for particular HTR communities (Supplementary Data S6). In total, we identified 50 distinct community-specific GO BPs (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Table S5), some of which were functionallay related to corresponding infections. For example, catabolic process and intracellular protein transport are specifically activated in HTR Community 2, whereas mRNA metabolic process and intracellular transport are specifically inhibited in HTR Community 8; the immune/defense response, positive regulation of I KappaB/NF-KappaB cascade, and negative regulation of apoptosis/programmed cell death are highly activated in HTRs to oncogenic pathogens in Community 31718, but not in HTRs to the DNA tumor viruses in Community 5, in which G protein-coupled receptor signaling and sensory perception are specifically down regulated1920. Notably, the same G protein-coupled receptor signaling is specifically activated in both HTR Communities 6 and 721. However, pathogens in Community 6 cause additional diverse HTR dysregualtions, including specifically up regulated cell signaling and second messenger mediated signaling, as well as down regulated DNA metabolic process and repair, cell cycle (including M phase, mitosis), and response to DNA damage and endogenous stimulus. To some extent, these gene functional features helped distinguish proteobateria in Community 6 to those in Community 7. Together with annotated infection attributes, the gene expression pattern analysis validated our within-HTR community pathogen associations, further demonstrating the host response patterns to infections of different pathogen types are limited and differential.",

Nonetheless, HTR community analysis yielded the strongest positive association with HTR Community 8 for the T. denticola query signature derived from calvarial overlying soft tissues, but not those from calvarial bones (Fig. 7b,c). This dissociation is likely due to the fact that the three reference profiles in the HTR Connectivity Map were not derived from calvarial bones (Supplementary Table S1), whose expressed transcripts are generally not shared with other cell or tissue types.

Through further clustering, we identified eight pathogen groups, that is, HTR Communities, with a discernible consensus of internal HTR similarities. The methodologies used in this study, including gene expression profile merging, comparison, and clustering, were first introduced by Iorio et al.12 and Subramanian et al.11 Previously, these methods performed very well in characterizing and predicting similarities in drug effect and mode of action across cell lines and dosages, and further in partitioning drugs into communities (i.e., compounds with similar modes of action). Moreover, it was our aim to complement this HTR Community as a resource and elucidate the HTR associations established among the 50 pathogens. To this end, we collected laboratory and clinical infection characteristics for individual pathogens, and then identified computationally HTR-related infection attributes, as well as differential gene expression patterns, for each HTR community.

This dissociation is likely related to the fact that S. Suis is primarily a commensal and opportunistic swine/pig pathogen, with human infections being infrequent but grave when an outbreak does occur43. Besides, the enriched GO BPs obtained for HTRs to S. Suis were divergent from those of the other four pathogens in HTR Community 5, which are DNA tumor viruses (Fig. 3).",

However, we learned from the literature that\u2014similar to IAV\u2014hPIV and hMPV also have hemagglutinin-neuraminidase and functionally similar proteins (e.g., fusion protein F) on their surfaces that serve as antigenic and virulent markers4445. Moreover, their dual community associations can be explained by the shared gene expression patterns in HTR communities 3 and 6. Specifically, HTRs to pathogens in Community 3 showed enrichment in positive regulation of NF-kappaB signaling and immune responses, as well as negative regulation of apoptosis, whereas HTRs to pathogens in Community 6 showed enrichment in decreasing host cell mitotic activity (Fig. 4). Consistent with these findings, NF-kappaB signaling is induced strongly by hMPV and hPIV infection464748 and decreased cell mitotic activity has been reported to occur following hPIV infection49.

We paired infection samples and control samples in accordance with five principles:Very early infection sample measurements (<1 h) were not taken.Pathogen infection samples were paired with control samples such that experiment conditions (i.e. cell type and culture time) were identical.Samples measured before infection or at infection time 0 were treated as controls if there were no control samples measured after time 0.If the number of control samples exceeded the number of infection samples, the excess control samples were omitted.If the number of infection samples exceeded the number of control samples, the excess infection samples were omitted unless they were designated as simple repeated measurements or replications of the same experimental condition. In such cases, the excess infection samples were paired with used control samples in a revolving fashion. For example, if there were two control samples c1 and c2 and five infection samples i1 to i5, then i1, i3, and i5 would be paired with c1, while i2 and i4 were paired with c2.",

A single synthetic PRL (22,160 genes ranked according to their differential expression relative to the control) was computed to represent consensus and common HTRs to infection with a pathogen across different cell lines and from different laboratories. GSEA was used to score each reference profile for the direction and strength of enrichment with the query reference signature. The connectivity of HTRs between pathogen pairs was then presented in a map/matrix, with positive scores indicating functionally similar HTRs and negative scores indicating opposing HTRs. Through clustering, 50 pathogens were grouped into eight HTR communities (i.e., pathogens that induce more consensus HTRs). Characteristic infection attributes and gene expression patterns were identified for each HTR community.
