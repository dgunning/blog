            "text": "Epidemiologic transition theory models the changes in cause-specific mortality that accompanied the industrialization-associated demographic transition, the declines in mortality and fertility, and the resulting population growth (18) (see Fig. 1). Demographic transition theory is a simplified, descriptive, multistage model of this transition (14). Stage 1 is largely preindustrial and features high mortality and fertility, variable but generally low life expectancy, and slow but stable population growth interrupted by large periodic fluctuations in mortality (crisis mortality). Stage 2 involves declining \u2018normal\u2019 mortality but persistently high fertility. Stage 3 features continued declines in normal mortality as well as fertility, increased life expectancy, and more sustained population growth. Declining normal mortality began in the mid-nineteenth century in western and northern Europe and the United States and around 1920 in LMICs, such as Chile. Crisis mortality continued into the twentieth century, perhaps ending only with the 1918\u20131919 Spanish influenza outbreak (14). Stage 4 features low, still declining mortality, as observed in developed countries after World War II (19). Mortality declines continue, especially among the elderly, but slowly, likely due to already low mortality among infants, children, and young adults (14).",

Stage 1, the \u2018Age of Pestilence and Famine\u2019, is preindustrial and is characterized by high frequencies of epidemic infectious disease and crisis mortality. Stages 2 and 3, the \u2018Age of Receding Pandemics\u2019, involve a change from epidemic to endemic infectious disease and decreasing crisis mortality. Stage 4, the \u2018Age of Degenerative and Man-Made [sic] Diseases\u2019, ushers in a high burden of NCDs, the result of age-related degenerative processes and anthropogenic factors including environmental hazards and nutritional and behavioral patterns associated with industrialization and urban living. The neat dichotomy between infections and NCDs is blurred by the chronic course of some infections, such as tuberculosis, and increasing recognition of the role of infection and inflammatory processes in many chronic conditions, such as cervical cancer (20) and coronary heart disease (21). However, rather than precluding the use of transition theory, this complication highlights the need to consider the historical and evolutionary relationships between humans and pathogens to understand current patterns of human health.",

            "text": "Multiple modifications have been made to Omran's original theory. Omran (2), attempting to accommodate variations from the theory, initially characterized three models for the progress of the transition. The \u2018classical model\u2019, featuring slow progression from high to low mortality and fertility, occurred in Western Europe, and was driven by economic development and advances in sanitation, public health, and medical knowledge. The \u2018accelerated model\u2019, seen in Japan, features more rapid progress, purportedly driven by the same factors. The \u2018contemporary model\u2019 applies to LMICs, wherein mortality has declined but fertility remains high and NCDs do not yet constitute the primary epidemiologic burden. Beyond the expansions suggested by Barrett and colleagues (1), Olshansky and colleagues have added a fourth stage, the \u2018Age of Delayed Degenerative Diseases\u2019, which recognizes a shift in NCDs to the elderly even as life expectancy increases, and a fifth, encompassing morbidity and mortality from HIV/AIDS and other emerging infectious diseases (22, 23). Graziano (24) has proposed an alternative fifth stage, the \u2018Age of Obesity and Inactivity\u2019, in which increasing levels of weight gain and obesity alter the pattern of NCDs among the elderly (represented by Olshansky and Ault's fourth stage).",

            "text": "From anthropological and epidemiological perspectives, the original epidemiologic transition theory has several shortcomings. The proposed explanations are largely speculative, lacking reliable data or relying on small sample sizes that are not likely to be generalizable (16). Many have also argued that the theory insufficiently addresses social factors, such as poverty (12); the differential progress of the transition within and across various demographic subgroups\u2014such as in relation to sex, gender, race, and location (12, 25); and the profound contemporary impact of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS and multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB)(12, 25, 26). It also fails to differentiate adequately between the risk of dying from any given cause or set of causes and the proportion of overall mortality due to various causes (14, 25). Additionally, by focusing on mortality, the theory largely neglects issues of morbidity, disability, and quality of life. This approach is sharply divergent from the increasing use of more holistic definitions of health and the use of broader measures of life expectancy, such as disability adjusted life years (DALYs), by health researchers and organizations (16). Saliently, Caldwell (6: 160) and others have also critiqued Omran's models for failing to recognize \u2018the global nature and historical sequence of the mortality transition as it spread\u2019, positing instead that each society exhibits its own particular model. Despite these issues, however, the theory remains profoundly useful for investigating variation in patterns over time and among locations, for conceptualizing historical patterns, and for predicting future trends (17).",

Instead, the socioecological model recognizes that a broad array of systems and interrelated determinants of health exist, acting either synergistically or antagonistically (16). The model vertically expands the domain of epidemiological studies \u2018upward\u2019 to incorporate biological, behavioral, mental, social, and environmental systems and factors (such as policy and economic environments) as well as \u2018downward\u2019 to the molecular and genetic levels.

In epidemiology, the increasing adoption of and reliance upon socioecological models has also opened up a spectrum of possibilities for investigations of disease risk that include social, cultural, policy, and economic factors, as well as how these factors have changed over time (5, 16). The unique capacity of epidemiologic transition theory to identify ultimate causes in disease risk means that transition theory models can be usefully incorporated into socioecological models in epidemiology. As Fleischer and McKeown (16: 10) discuss, such incorporation would be particularly useful for social epidemiologists because it would shed additional light on the ways in which \u2018upstream\u2019, global determinants differentially impact the health-states of vulnerable, disadvantaged populations. Although the focus on singular disease conditions, their risk factors, and proximate causes is useful in some investigations, epidemiologists are gradually recognizing that addressing patterns of health-states might yield greater insights into more upstream, shared determinants and therefore have a profound impact upon population health (16).",

However, rather than highly virulent pathogens, such as smallpox or measles (33), the phenomenon has been attributed to the diminished exposure to environmental microorganisms (specifically helminthic parasites, chronic viruses and nonlethal bacterial infections, environmental saprophytes) and to declines in the mass and diversity of gut microbiota, which also occurred as part of the second transition (34). Situated within epidemiologic transition theory, these observations have given rise to the \u2018hygiene hypothesis\u2019, which claims that in developed nations, diminished childhood exposure during childhood or even diminished prenatal (maternal) exposure (35) to these microorganisms has resulted in immunoregulatory failure, manifesting as an increased incidence of CIDs.

Although the identified causes are broadly environmental and evolutionary, they directly translate into proximate causes and therefore specific risk factors and targets for preventive medicine. Informed by the hygiene hypothesis, researchers have identified causal relationships among lifestyle changes, infectious burden, and the incidence of allergic and autoimmune diseases. They continue to investigate these dynamics using animal models of autoimmune and allergic diseases and, to a lesser extent, clinical intervention studies (32). For example, the incidence of spontaneous type 1 diabetes (T1D) is directly correlated with the sanitary conditions of animal facilities for non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, with a low infectious burden translating into a high T1D incidence (37). Another study found that intranasal exposure of pregnant mice to cowshed derived, nonpathogenic bacterium, Acinetobacter lwoffii F78, protected against the development of experimental asthma in their progeny (35). Other researchers have found that in humans, intentional infection with the swine-derived helminth, Trichuris suis, ameliorated symptoms in patients with active Crohn's disease as well as ulcerative colitis (38, 39). Although research findings are not yet determinative\u2014for instance, helminth eradication has been found to increase atopic skin sensitization (40) while improving asthma symptoms in the same population (41)\u2014studies such as these suggest that approaching the broad trend of increased incidence of CIDs through an evolutionary, historical lens generates findings that can be directly applied to improving population health. Research focused on determining which types of microbial exposures exert a protective effect on developing allergic sensitization (and when during the life course they occur) can translate into improved identification of risk factors, targeted strategies for disease prevention, and foci for preventive medicine.",

Looking back to the Neolithic period, changes in subsistence, settlement, and social organization associated with the agricultural revolution created conditions that selected for the emergence of acute, epidemic, \u2018crowd\u2019 infectious diseases, such as smallpox, measles, and pertussis, which were among the chief causes of human morbidity and mortality up until the second epidemiologic transition (1). Agriculture allowed for the production of high calorie foods at the cost of dietary diversity (43), and agricultural communities that rely heavily on a few crops often experience compromised nutrition that can predispose them to infection (44, 45). In addition, domesticated animals served as the source for many novel human pathogens, such as measles and smallpox, as did the expansion of farmers into new terrain suited to the transmission of diseases such as malaria and yellow fever (46). The transition to large and densely settled societies also allowed for the ongoing transmission of more virulent and shorter-lived infections, such as crowd diseases, within and between human populations. Furthermore, the creation of social hierarchies led to the unequal distribution of basic resources for healthy living, thereby creating reservoirs for new and recurring infections in impoverished communities (12, 47).",

Recognizing that the agricultural revolution brought new infections into human populations through increased exposure to animals, researchers have examined the entry of novel contemporary pathogens through human settlement in uninhabited wilderness areas and subsistence practices such as bushmeat hunting. Research has shown that bushmeat handling and consumption of nonhuman primates in particular has provided a highly effective pathway for the transmission of zoonotic pathogens into human populations, both in the past and today (50); several infections in humans, such as HIV/AIDS (via simian immunodeficiency viruses [SIVs]) (51) and a wide variety of human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLVs), which are associated with leukemia, lymphoma, and HTLV-associated myelopathy (52), have been linked to pathogens present in nonhuman primates. Understanding these relationships and the pathological consequences of interspecies interactions has substantial implications for public health. As in Neolithic times, the wide array of subsistence practices that increase exposure between humans and animals increases the probability that nonhuman pathogens will, through a series of evolutionary steps, evolve the ability to infect humans, and later, evolve the capacity for sustained transmission within and between human populations. Recognizing these dynamics helps to inform international economic and environmental policies and technological innovations aimed at reducing these exposures (53).",

The FDA announced in December 2013 that it was phasing out the use of antibiotics as growth promoters in cows, pigs, and chickens (54). Although this policy is voluntary for drug manufacturers and subject to loopholes, it represents one of the first attempts by the U.S. government to address one of the ultimate causes driving the third epidemiologic transition, specifically the reemergence of previously controlled infectious diseases. The European Union has long since recognized this issue, having passed regulations against the use of human antibiotics, and their analogs, as growth factors in livestock (55). This policy change and the research underlying it reflect an increased understanding in the public health community that drug resistance not only poses a large and growing threat to human health but that this trend fits into a larger evolutionary pattern of selective relationships between humans, animals, and pathogens. Ten thousand years ago, domestication of animals gave human populations zoonotic infections; in the present, our interactions with domesticated animals are conferring drug resistant infections upon us.",

To some extent, this can be seen as a convergence of disease patterns associated with the two previous epidemiologic transitions. As with the first transition, physical and social environments are once again selecting for the emergence and transmission of acute epidemic infections in human populations. As with the second transition, NCDs continue to rise in populations rich and poor, in developed nations and LMICs alike. In a combination of these two trends, acute and chronic diseases are leading to the emergence of global syndemics, wherein the interaction between two or more health conditions\u2014such as among diabetes, cardiopulmonary disease, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\u2014has a multiplicative rather than additive impact on human well-being (56).",

Shifting from primarily vertically organized programs aimed at single diseases and proximate causes, epidemiologists and other health researchers can develop complementary horizontally based programs aimed at combinations of infectious and chronic diseases and the upstream determinants that they have in common. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has begun this process with the merging of previously independent programs and divisions within its organization (57). Similarly, observers of polio eradication programs, for example, have increasingly begun to recognize that treatment and vaccination cannot be successfully implemented without addressing broader health determinants, such as those responsible for the first and second epidemiologic transitions (58). Applying these lessons to current global health challenges may not eradicate all human diseases, but it could generate and marshal support for novel, broadscale interventions that target the ultimate causes for many important health conditions. At that point, we hope to write optimistically about the positive lessons evident a fourth epidemiologic transition.",
