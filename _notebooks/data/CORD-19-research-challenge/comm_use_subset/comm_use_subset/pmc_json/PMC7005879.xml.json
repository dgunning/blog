A landmark study conducted in Tanzania showed that due to a change in epidemiology, a broad spectrum of pathogens replaced P. falciparum malaria as the most common cause of disease in children in this area1. However, a few years later, P. falciparum malaria, is still seen to be the main cause of febrile illnesses in Ghana, West Africa2. When unaware, these differences in epidemiology might lead to misdiagnosis as well as inefficient treatment by the medical personnel. The process of medical diagnosis includes the joint interpretation of symptoms, clinical signs and laboratory findings. Careful selection and prioritization of a diagnostic setup are informed by a priori knowledge of the seasonal, local and worldwide frequency and distribution of a given disease3,4.",

Consequently, in Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9, infections were most often caused by parasites (62%) (Plasmodium species and one Schistosoma haematobium infection), followed by bacteria (21%) and viruses (18%). Malaria cases were significantly associated with fever grade 3 (body temperature between 39.4 \u00b0C and 40 \u00b0C), lethargy, unconsciousness, and convulsions as described in neighboring Congo8, and with anemia, malnutrition, and thrombocytopenia. Malnutrition can be an important factor related to malaria as described in hospitalized Mozambican children9 and is also pre-disposing to bacteremia10. Interestingly, we observed an association of malaria and malnutrition despite the generally low prevalence of malnutrition in Gabon.

In stool samples, viruses were identified less frequently than in Tanzania1. In addition, we observed lower rates of invasive bacteria, typhoid and non-typhoid Salmonella species in our cohort than in Kenyan children24. Those differences may be related to different pathogen dynamics, ecology and level of hygiene between the areas. Co-morbidities were common. In our population, the measles vaccination rate was 54%, well below the WHO25 recommended vaccination rate of 95%, in order to prevent measles epidemics and ultimately to eradicate the disease. However, the situation for the other EPI vaccines was better with a vaccination coverage of above 80% for all vaccines that are scheduled to be given within the first 14 weeks of life and not like measles and yellow fever vaccine at 9 months of age.",
