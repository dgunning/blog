There are multiple factors that contribute to PRDC including multiple viral and bacterial infections, environmental conditions, and management practices.

            "text": "Currently, PRDC is one of the biggest health concerns to the Asian swine industry. The etiological agents associated with PRDC may vary between different geographic regions, but in Asia, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) are the primary pathogens which cause the majority of the PRDC cases resulting in devastating economic losses [1]. Most Asian swine producers control PRDC by use of preventative vaccines rather than antibiotics. Combination vaccines are preferred in order to reduce pig stress and to decrease labor cost. A trivalent vaccine mixture (3FLEX, Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, St. Joseph, Missouri, USA) against M. hyopneumoniae, PCV2, and PRRSV has been licensed in many Asian countries to control PRDC. However, there is concern from some swine producers that this trivalent vaccine mixture may be less effective compared to the respective monovalent vaccines currently available because of possible interferences among the mixed antigens. In this study, we decided to evaluate the efficacy of this trivalent vaccine mixture (3FLEX, Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica) against a triple challenge of M. hyopneumoniae, PCV2, and PRRSV and compare it to the efficacy of the respective monovalent vaccines. Clinical, immunological, microbiological, and pathological parameters were chosen for evaluation.",

The trivalent vaccine mixture, however, did not result in equal protection when compared against each respective monovalent vaccine, with the largest vaccine occurring within PRRSV.

In contrast, growth performance was better but not significantly different between M. hyopneumoniae-vaccinated and control pigs following M. hyopneumoniae challenge. These results are consistent with previous findings, where no significant difference on growth performance was observed between M. hyopneumoniae-vaccinated and unvaccinated pigs following an M. hyopneumoniae challenge [3, 4]. No significant difference on growth performance was also observed between PRRS-vaccinated and control pigs [5]. The possible reason for the lack of statistical significance could be that the growth performance of the pigs vaccinated with the monovalent vaccine was only evaluated for 6 weeks after a single challenge. In addition, growth retardation by a single challenge is likely not very severe. Therefore, the improvement on growth performance by the monovalent vaccines is not as drastic. A triple challenge is typically more severe than a single challenge. In addition, in a field study, infection with M. hyopneumoniae, PRRSV, and PCV2 increased the chance for opportunistic secondary bacterial infections which could result in further growth retardation. However, we did not observe a decrease in growth performance due to secondary bacterial infection in this experimental study. Taken together the results suggest that growth performance is an important parameter in evaluating the trivalent vaccine mixture but not as important for evaluating the efficacy of the monovalent vaccines under experimental conditions.",

In addition, previous work has shown that an M. hyopneumoniae vaccine can reduce interstitial pneumonia caused by PRRSV [8]. Therefore, control of M. hyopneumoniae is the first step to control PRDC caused by the three challenge pathogens used in this study. The trivalent vaccine mixture and monovalent M. hyopneumoniae vaccine were able to elicit similar numbers of M. hyopneumoniae-specific IFN-\u03b3-SC in vaccinated pigs. This is important since, the cell-mediated immunity as measured by IFN-\u03b3-SC has been shown to play an important role in controlling M. hyopneumoniae infection [9, 10]. Induction of cell-mediated immunity is also associated with a significant reduction in the amount of M. hyopneumoniae nasal shedding [11]. Vaccination with the trivalent product resulted in a comparable reduction of M. hyopneumoniae nasal shedding and lung lesions to that of the respective M. hyopneumoniae monovalent.",

Reduction in viremia and lung lesions, and induction of cell-mediated immunity, specifically PRRSV-specific IFN-\u03b3-SC which are used for the assessment of antigen-specific T-cell responses in swine [15, 16] are important criteria for PRRSV vaccine evaluation. Despite the fact that the protective role of IFN-\u03b3-SC is controversial [17], correlation between activation of T cell responses and clearance of PRRSV in blood has been previously reported [18, 19]. These data suggest that T cell responses elicited by PRRSV MLV vaccine play a role in the reduction of PRRSV viremia in vaccinated-challenged pigs. In our study vaccination with either trivalent vaccine mixture or monovalent PRRS vaccine, both resulted in the induction of T cell responses and a reduction in the viral load in the blood simultaneously.

The study was conducted at the Seoul National University, Department of Veterinary Pathology which contained a HEPA-filtered isolator. One room contained pigs from each group. The rooms each contained 10 pens with an individual pig housed per pen. Vaccinated groups were randomly assigned to each to include 20 pigs, 10 of which were female and 10 of which were male. These were further split into two rooms (10 pigs per room). Unvaccinated groups were assigned 10 pigs (5 male and 5 female) which were housed in a single room. The random number generator (Excel, Microsoft Corporation) was used to assign pigs to groups and rooms. Several key housing elements were taken into consideration such as both slatted and solid surface pen flooring, and rooms were lit for 12 h/day with the light intensity set to 40 lx in order to simulate daytime. The temperature in each room was also kept at a constant 22 \u00b0C. Water was available for piglets to drink freely throughout the day via a nipple drinker which was placed in each pen. Each pen was additionally equipped with a self-feeder which provided access to a standard-balanced, age-appropriate, pelleted feed diet. Playtime stimulation was offered by placing a rubber ball in each pen.",

The 3FLEX vaccine was prepared as follows: MycoFLEX (Serial no. 2730534A) and CircoFLEX (Serial no. 3091124A) were mixed together, and the mixture was then used to rehydrate Ingelvac PRRS MLV (Serial no. 2451180A).
