While the primary host reservoir responsible for harboring the immediate ancestor of SARS-CoV has yet to be identified, evidence of direct transmission of the virus between civets in close proximity to humans has been observed and reported in at least two distinct events [7,8,9].

The Bioinformatics Resource Centers (BRC) for Infectious Diseases [15,16,17] were created to serve as database resources for the integration of research and surveillance data being generated by these DMID-sponsored resources and by other primary investigators working on infectious diseases caused by different groups of human pathogens and their insect vectors. The objective of the BRC program is to provide a one-stop-shop for data and analytical tools to support data mining and analysis workflows for both basic and applied research. The Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) BRC (www.viprbrc.org) supports virology researchers studying select agents and other significant public health pathogens belonging to 14 virus families, including Coronaviridae [16]. Cross-referencing data and integrating computational tools into the online ViPR resource allows complex analyses to be easily performed by researchers regardless of their bioinformatics training or expertise.",

First, ViPR captures different types of data from both external and internal sources and makes them accessible through custom search pages. ViPR stores these data for virus families categorized as containing either human priority pathogens or possible public health threats including 6 families of single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses\u2014Caliciviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Hepeviridae, Picornaviridae, Togaviridae, 5 families of single-stranded negative-sense RNA viruses\u2014Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Filoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, 1 family of double-stranded RNA viruses\u2014Reoviridae, and 2 families of double-stranded DNA viruses\u2014Herpesviridae, Poxviridae. Although ViPR is focused on supporting human infectious disease research, related viruses within these families isolated from other host species are also accessible to allow comparative genomics research. Second, ViPR has assembled a suite of data analysis and visualization tools so that users can perform custom correlative analyses. Third, datasets and analysis results can be saved in private workspaces in the ViPR Workbench for subsequent retrieval and sharing. ",

While this functionality is based on previous work in human HLA and influenza virus proteins [27,28], it has been extended to the various taxa within ViPR. Sequence Feature (SF) definitions are obtained from the scientific literature, GenBank, UniProt and IEDB records, and are categorized as structural (e.g. alpha-helices), functional (e.g. active sites), immune epitopes or sequence alteration SF types. SF definitions are currently available in ViPR for Dengue (serotypes 1-4), Hepatitis C (subtype 1a) and Pox (Vaccinia) viruses; however, functionality exists that allows researchers to add new definitions for any other virus species in ViPR through community annotation efforts. Such crowd-sourcing efforts are essential to provide the custom sequence feature definitions for each taxon, which can then be useful in performing data mining, comparative genomics and/or evolutionary analyses by the community as a whole. In order to maintain highly accurate definitions within ViPR, all community-proposed SFs are inspected and validated by domain experts prior to becoming publicly accessible through ViPR.",

The intent of these studies is to identify host factors that positively- and/or negatively influence virus replication across a range of experimental variables using high-throughput \u201c-omics\u201d methods including gene expression microarrays, proteomics and RNA interference technologies. For each set of experimental variables, the lists of host factors, called \u201cbiosets\u201d, that are identified as being significantly different when compared to controls are submitted to ViPR. The aim of this component is to provide easy access to the processed data, establish an automated approach for users to perform a rapid comparison of their own gene(s) of interest against those that have previously been identified through virus-host response experiments, and to offer the analytical tools necessary to interpret such data. Currently, ViPR contains data from multiple host factor experiments involving SARS-CoV and influenza A virus infections in cell culture and in experimental animals, and provides a Boolean search function to identify shared, unique or combined lists of factors found to be significant between such experiments. Additional datasets from experiments using other viruses will be imported in the future.",

Whole and partial genome sequence records can be searched with user-specified criteria including genera, species, virus host, and geographical and/or temporal point of isolation. Currently, the Coronaviridae component in ViPR contains sequence data for viruses annotated as being isolated from 68 different host types across 59 countries between 1941 and 2011. Keyword searches can be used to retrieve database entries based on any available metadata.

This visualization tool has been further customized to take advantage of the extensive metadata associated with the various sequence records stored in the ViPR database, to allow user-driven coloration of the labels at the terminal nodes (i.e. \u201cleaves\u201d) of the phylogenetic tree according to the host, country or year of isolation. A high-resolution image of the customized phylogenetic tree display can be exported in a variety of formats to enable more in-depth interpretation and/or inclusion in presentations or publications. For the current scientific use case, RAxML was used to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree for all sequence records that matched the original search and filtering criteria, which was subsequently colored based on the host of isolation (Figure 4b). The tree topology for this phylogenetic reconstruction shows two major clades that separate largely according to both the year and host of isolation. The majority of strains from the first clade were taken in 2003 with all but two members of this clade being isolated from civets (hereafter referred to as the \u2018civet-predominate clade\u2019). For the second clade, almost all of the strains were sampled in 2004 with all but two members isolated from humans (hereafter referred to as the \u2018human-predominate clade\u2019). This topology confirms that at least two species-jump events between civet and human have occurred [9]. It also suggests that this species barrier does not appear to be a significant bottleneck for SARS-CoV.",

Input for this tool can include sequence search results, working sets, or custom upload of both sequence data and the associated metadata. Once the desired sequences are selected, the tool guides the user through the necessary steps of 1) assigning the sequences to up to five different groups based on metadata or other user criteria, 2) aligning all assigned sequences, 3) performing automated statistical analyses on the sequences, and 4) viewing the results.",

Specifically, our phylogenetic tree corroborates the theory that there were at least two separate human outbreaks from viruses closely related to two separate clades isolated from civets during the time of the SARS-CoV epidemic. Our tree also shows a strong correlation between host and year of isolation, although this observation is not true for all strains included in the tree. The meta-CATS analysis identified significant p-values for 117 nucleotide residues that were identified as having significant variation between the civet and human isolates. The positions that are located within the SARS-CoV Spike protein receptor-binding motif, which were identified by meta-CATS, appear to reflect virus sequence variations that affect binding to host-specific receptor proteins. Additional wet-lab experimentation will be required to elucidate the specific function of the remaining significant sequence variations and whether they alter the fitness of the virus. Mapping residues and regions of interest onto a 3D protein structure can yield additional insight into their functional role. The scientific use case that was explored here serves as an example of the ability of ViPR to support data exploration and the generation of biologically relevant hypotheses that can then be subjected to more in-depth laboratory testing through experimentation.",
