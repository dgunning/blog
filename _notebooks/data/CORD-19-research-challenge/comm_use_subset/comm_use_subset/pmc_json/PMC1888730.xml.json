The screening was accomplished using a computer docking program, DOCK, that docked each chemical of the database into the active sites of the enzymes and evaluated the shape complementarity of the docked compound relative to the active sites. Inspired by this seminal work, the EUDOC program was devised to search for the specific conformations, positions, and orientations of two three-dimensional (3D) structures that permit the strongest nonbonded intermolecular interactions between the two. The EUDOC program uses docking algorithms that differ from those of DOCK [3]. It addresses molecular flexibility by using conformation selection and conformation substitution mechanisms that enable massively parallel computing [3]. EUDOC was devised to perform on a cluster of more than 300 loosely connected processors [3] and has recently been ported to the IBM Blue Gene/L supercomputer [4], [5]. This program has successfully predicted small-molecule-bound protein complexes and identified drug leads from chemical databases [6]\u2013[12].",

Because a large database can be divided into subsets, a sustained petaflops capability would be able to screen 23 million chemicals in about 10 minutes or to screen 200\u00d75000 billion chemicals for one drug target in a year [4]. This capability offers the possibility of identifying inhibitors that are effective enough for in vivo testing, eliminating the need of medicinal chemistry to improve the efficiency of inhibitor leads identified by terascale computers [4]. In the context of this promise, we seek to extend the application of the EUDOC program to supramolecular chemistry.",

The guest and host molecules in the complex crystal structure were separated, and the guest structure was then docked back into the host structure by the EUDOC program. This docking process used translational and rotational increments of 1.0 \u00c5 and 10\u00b0 of arc, respectively, and a docking box that was defined to enclose the guest structure in the guest-host complex crystal structure. Of many EUDOC-generated guest-host complexes, only the complex with the strongest interaction energy was compared to the corresponding crystal structure of the complex. In this comparison, the host portion of the EUDOC-generated complex was superimposed onto the host portion of the crystal structure, and the mass-weighted root mean square deviation (mwRMSD) of the guest portion between the two superimposed complexes was calculated. If the mwRMSD was <2.0 or 1.0 \u00c5, the crystal structure of the complex was reproduced or accurately reproduced, respectively, by the EUDOC program [3]. Because the uncertainty in calculating the interaction energy using the EUDOC program was estimated to be 0.7 kcal/mol [3], occasionally, a few EUDOC-generated complexes were considered to have the strongest interaction energy and compared to the crystal structure thus resulting in multiple mwRMSDs, if their interaction energies differed from the strongest interaction energy by \u22640.7 kcal/mol. In that case, as long as one of the mwRMSDs was <2.0 or 1.0 \u00c5, the crystal structure of the binary complex was reproduced or accurately reproduced, respectively, by the EUDOC program.",

Complex XAGMAT is one of the 12 complexes that the EUDOC program failed to reproduce. Despite a favorable \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction between the guest and host structures predicted by the EUDOC program, in the corresponding crystal structure the guest structure surprisingly docks at a region at which it partly interacts with the host via a \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction (see Fig. 2). This discrepancy suggests that the guest might partly interact with host(s) and/or guest(s) in neighboring unit cells of the crystal structure. To confirm this, the docking study with complex XAGMAT was repeated with consideration of the influence of crystal packing\u2014namely, the guest was docked into a multimeric host system that included neighboring host(s) and/or guest(s). These neighboring structures were generated by applying the symmetry of the space group of the crystal structure. The host(s) and/or guest(s) in neighboring unit cells were excluded if these structures were >4.0 \u00c5 away from the guest to be docked. Interestingly, when the influence of crystal packing was taken into account, the EUDOC program accurately reproduced complex XAGMAT with an mwRMSD of 0.07 \u00c5, instead of the 3.52 \u00c5 obtained without consideration of crystal packing.

Visual inspection of these structures revealed that the binding between the guest and host structures was mediated by crystallographically determined water molecules. This mediation suggested that, similar to the crystal packing, water molecules might also play an important role in guest-host complexation, and it might be necessary to include them in the multimeric host system for docking. Accordingly, the docking studies with the 161 complexes were repeated with consideration of the influences of both crystal packing and structural waters. The results are listed in Table 4. Indeed, the EUDOC program accurately reproduced complexes XAQJAA and XAQJEE with mwRMSDs of 0.03 and 0.27 \u00c5, respectively.

These results show that the influence of crystal packing or crystal environment on crystal structures of guest-host complexes is significant, which is consistent with the reported influence of crystal packing on protein structures [14]. These results also show that the influence of structural waters on guest\u2013host complex crystal structures is insignificant, which is consistent with our reported finding that complexation between a small molecule and a protein is not commonly mediated by water molecules [3]. This study therefore suggests that crystal packing should be taken into account when reproducing crystal structures of small-molecule guest-host complexes through docking studies, whereas water molecules, counterions or other companying molecules such as ethanol can be excluded from the host system. This study also suggests that, ideally, to perform prospective and accurate docking of a small molecule into another small molecule, repetitive docking of a guest or host into a guest-host complex that is generated by the previous docking is preferred, because a host is sometimes too small to prevent a guest from interacting with nearby guest(s) and/or host(s). It is worth noting, however, that the success rate of docking a small molecule into another small molecule is about 93% if the influence of crystal packing is ignored.",

Both 3D structures were refined with energy minimization monitored with a normal-mode (NMODE) analysis to ensure that the energy minimization stopped when the minimized conformation reached a local potential energy minimum. The energy minimization was performed by using the SANDER module of the AMBER5 program [19] with the second-generation AMBER force field [17], and the NMODE analysis was carried out using the NMODE module of the AMBER8 program [19]. Given the refined 3D structures of quinoxaline and Rebek's acridine diacid, the EUDOC program generated a complex nearly identical to the crystal structure of form A (mwRMSD: 0.7 \u00c5) but not the proposed complex with nearly face-to-face \u03c0-stacking.

This confirmation suggests that to design high-affinity guest-host complexes it is of advantage to incorporate the entropic energy into the binding, because the number of functional groups that can be introduced onto the guest and host structures to confer the nonbonded interactions is limited by the size of the two partners.
