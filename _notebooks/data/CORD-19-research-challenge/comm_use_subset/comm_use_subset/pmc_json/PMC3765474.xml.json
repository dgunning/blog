            "text": "CEACAMs are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily and are involved in the regulation of various cellular functions such as differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis and many more [1]. All CEA family members are highly glycosylated and mediate homophilic and/or heterophilic binding. CEACAM1 is found on epithelial cells, endothelial cells and on leukocytes, including granulocytes, T cells, B cells, and NK cells [2-4]. CEACAM5 is expressed on epithelial cells and CEACAM6 on granulocytes and epithelial cells [1]. Many CEACAMs can be recruited by different pathogens as receptors and, in addition to effectuate adhesion, mediate bacterial internalization and even evasion of immune responses [3]. Pathogens interacting with members of the CEA family include gram-negative bacteria colonizing human respiratory mucosa, like Neisseria meningitidis, typable and non-typable Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis[5-11]. The ability of pathogens to target CEACAMs possibly allows them to colonize mucosal surfaces by mediating adhesion and by exploiting immunosuppressive functions of CEACAM receptors. Pathogen binding to CEACAM1 is of especial importance since it leads to the suppression of several receptors that activate important cellular pathways of the innate or adaptive immune response, such as Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2, TLR4, T-cell receptor and B-cell receptor [12-18]. The interferences with TLR signaling as well as the interference with T-cell activation by CEACAM1 depend on the phosphorylation of the immuno-receptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) contained within the cytoplasmic domain of the long CEACAM1 isoforms [15,16,19].",

CEACAM5 and CEACAM6 are glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored to the cell membrane and possess seven and three extracellular Ig-like domains, respectively [24]. The four most commonly co-expressed CEACAM1 isoforms, CEACAM1-4L, CEACAM1-3L, CEACAM1-4S and CEACAM1-3S, possess three or four extracellular Ig-like domains, a trans-membrane domain and a long or a short intracellular domain [24]. While CEACAM1-L is able to transmit signals via its ITIM, CEACAM1-S is still able to mediate homophilic and heterophilic interactions and can trigger actin cytoskeleton re-organization [25,26]. CEACAM1-S can thus not only mediate adhesion as well as internalization of pathogens [27], but can also control the signaling activities of the long CEACAM1 isoforms [28].",

            "text": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and is expected to be the third leading cause of death, and the fifth leading cause of disability by 2020 [29]. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease defines COPD as characterized by persistent airflow limitation that is usually progressive and associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response in the airways and the lung to noxious particles or gases. Exacerbations are associated with increased airway and systemic inflammation, and evidence suggests that 70% may be caused by microorganisms [30]. Two pathogens that are associated with acute exacerbations and the progression of COPD are the CEACAM-interacting pathogens M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae, which often colonize the mucosa of the lower human respiratory tract in patients with COPD [31-33]. M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae express structurally unrelated outer membrane proteins, ubiquitous surface protein A1 (UspA1), and P5-homologous adhesin (P5), respectively, that share the ability to bind to the extracellular immunoglobulin V (IgV)-like domain of human CEACAM1 [5,8]. The interaction of CEACAM1 with M. catarrhalis results in reduced TLR2-initiated inflammatory responses of primary pulmonary epithelial cells [16]. CEACAM5 and CEACAM6 can mediate bacterial adhesion as well [5,7,8,34]. All three CEACAMs in human airway epithelia can therefore be of importance for the colonization of the lower airways and have a role in acute exacerbations. Since the lower respiratory airways are normally sterile and protected by mucociliary clearance, CEACAMs expressed here are most likely to encounter bacteria in medical conditions leading to dysfunction of the mucociliary clearance, such as COPD [35]. To date, a comprehensive analysis of (co-) expression patterns of CEACAM1 isoforms, CEACAM5 and CEACAM6 in the different lung tissues is lacking.",

Untreated confluent NHBE cells expressed CEACAM5 and CEACAM6, as well as the CEACAM1 isoforms CEACAM1-4L, CEACAM1-4S, CEACAM1-3L and CEACAM1-3S. This was shown through RT-PCR analysis with pairs of primers specific for each CEACAM and isoforms (Table 5). Identity of the obtained PCR-products for each CEACAM and isoforms was confirmed by sequencing. The intensity of the resulting bands after electrophoretic separation suggests that both CEACAM1 isoforms bearing the long cytoplasmic domain were expressed to a much lesser extent than the two short CEACAM1 isoforms. To address short-term effects of smoking on epithelial CEACAM expression, NHBE cells were exposed to CSE. To assess the tie of CEACAM expression in human lung cells to innate immune responses, NHBE cells were treated with IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03b2, IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, and the TLR agonists MALP-2 (TLR2/6), poly I:C (TLR3) and flagellin (TLR5). Then, RNA from these cells was isolated and qPCR analysis was used to check for differences in CEACAM1-4L, CEACAM1-3L, CEACAM1-4S, CEACAM1-3S, CEACAM5 and CEACAM6 mRNA levels. To ensure an accurate normalization of their expression levels, we tested two candidate housekeeping genes for their stability across the unstimulated and stimulated samples. PPIB (SD(\u00b1Ct)=0.24; CV(%Ct)=1.24) as well as HPRT1 (SD(\u00b1Ct)=0.34; CV(%Ct)=1.42) showed a highly stable expression, allowing for normalization with the geometric means of both genes.",

IFN\u03b1 significantly upregulated the expression of CEACAM1-4L (3.7-fold, p < 0.05), CEACAM1-4S (4.8-fold, p < 0.05) and CEACAM1-3S (4.3-fold, p < 0.001), whereas the 3.5-fold upregulation of CEACAM1-3L failed to reach significance (p = 0.124).

The M. catarrhalis wild type strains 25238 and BBH18 as well as the NTHi wild type strains 2019 and 1128 enhanced the mRNA expression of all four transmembrane CEACAM1-isoforms to a similar degree in a co-regulatory manner (Figure 5A,B,D,E). The mean induction of CEACAM1 transcription by M. catarrhalis strains was twice as high as by NTHi strains (3.5-5.5 fold vs. 1.9-2.8 fold). Since all four pathogens can bind to CEACAM1, we next tested whether this interaction was essential to the up-regulation of CEACAM1. To that end we used the M. catarrhalis UspA deletion mutant BBH18.1 and the NTHi P5 deletion mutant 1128f-, which both lack the respective CEACAM1-binding adhesin (Figure 5C,F). Again, the infection with these strains induced an elevated CEACAM1 expression (4.0-4.9 fold and 1.9-2.4 fold, respectively) comparable to their parental strains, indicating a CEACAM1-independent, more general mechanism for this effect. We then tested whether the CEACAM1 up-regulation might be due to an increase in interferons. Both M. catarrhalis 25238 and NTHi 2019 induced only a very small increase in IFN\u03b2 mRNA levels in NHBE cells that in part were not significant (Figure 5C). IFN\u03b2 mRNA levels were elevated two-fold or less after 4 and 8 h by both pathogens (compared to the 780-fold increase by poly I:C). However, M. catarrhalis induced as a secondary effect a significant 10.9-fold increase in IFN\u03b2 mRNA levels after 24 h.",

CEACAM expression was not connected to COPD, smoking status and granulocyte infiltration (Figure 1, Tables 3 and 4). Despite the analysis of non-cancer tissues from the specimen, the fact that the lung sections used for immunohistochemical analysis were from patients that underwent lung resection to treat lung cancer might conceal a regulatory effect of COPD or smoking status on CEACAM expression, since CEACAM1, CEACAM5, and CEACAM6 have all been shown to be up-regulated in lung cancer [49-53]. Also, the inflammatory processes associated with cancers of the lung might have had an effect on the expression levels of the CEACAMs. For example, as discussed below, IFN\u03b3 can up-regulate CEACAMs 1, 5, and 6. Importantly, we show that the COPD-associated pathogens M. catarrhalis and NTHi can also upregulate CEACAM1 expression independent of their ability to bind to CEACAM1.",

CEACAM5 and CEACAM6 expression levels were not affected by M. catarrhalis and NTHi. However, both receptors were already expressed at high levels and in all specimens (Figure 1, Tables 2 and 3). Regarding colonization, the increase in CEACAM1 on epithelial cells upon bacterial challenge is likely to increase bacterial adherence and infection. This interaction would be facilitated by an impaired mucocilliary clearance, which is associated with later phases of COPD. Thus, CEACAM receptors might be at least in part responsible for the colonization of the lower airways by M. catarrhalis and NTHi in COPD patients. This setting would also explain the association of bacterial colonization with progressive/advanced disease despite the fact that we did not find a regulation of CEACAM expression by the chronic pathologic conditions COPD, smoking status and granulocyte infiltration (Figure 1, Tables 3 and 4). Further studies including identification of pathogens in the lower airways will be necessary to shed light on this aspect of CEACAM-pathogen interactions. It will be also important to take into account that an up-regulation of CEACAMs might be transient either due to temporary qualities of chronic/persistent disease or due to pathogen characteristics at distinct time points during the infection process. It will also be interesting to test human lung tissues for the presence of the other CEACAMs expressed on epithelial cells (CEACAM7, 18, 20 and 21 [56,57]) and to analyze their ability to interact with pathogens.",

The amounts of soluble CEACAMs, with high concentrations of soluble CEACAM6 in all and lower concentrations of soluble CEACAM5 in 78.5% of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples is mirrored in the expression levels of their membrane-bound counterparts in lung tissues (Figures 1, 2, 3, 4 and [58-60]).

All membrane-bound CEACAM1 isoforms examined here were basically co-regulated under all conditions that affected their expression level (Figures 3 and 5). However, some differences were found for the differential up-regulation of the CEACAM1 isoforms. Type I interferons (IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2) favored the two short isoforms while the type II interferon IFN\u03b3 favored the long isoforms, and poly I:C favored the long and the short isoforms bearing 4 extracellular domains. Especially the former differences, even though not significant, are interesting with regard to the fact that in order to interfere with TLR signaling or with T-cell activation, binding of the Shp-1 phosphatase to the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) within the cytoplasmic domain of the long CEACAM1 isoform was necessary [15,16,19]. The two tyrosine residues that are part of the ITIM can bind to protein tyrosine kinases (e.g. c-Src) as well as protein tyrosine phosphatases (e.g. Shp-2) - leading to the stimulation or the inhibition of cell-signaling pathways, respectively. Long and short CEACAM1 isoforms can appear as monomers, dimers and oligomeric microclusters in the membrane [26,28]. Trans-homophilic binding between different CEACAM1 molecules increases cis-dimerization in the plane of the membrane via an allostery-based mechanism. Binding of CEACAM1-L to Shp-1 or c-Src is dependent on the balance between the oligomeric states as well as the ratio of long and short isoforms [26,28]. Interestingly, no cytoplasmic domain is necessary for the CEACAM1-mediated internalization of H. influenzae, M.catarrhalis and N. gonorrhea[27]. But bacterial engagement of CEACAM1 might, in addition to procuring adherence, also influence the cis-dimerization and subsequent inhibitory or activatory signaling of CEACAM1, either supporting pathogen colonization or host response. For example, the interaction of CEACAM1 with M. catarrhalis and N. meningitidis proteins resulted in reduced Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2-initiated inflammatory responses (the major mediator of M. catarrhalis-induced immune responses) of NHBE cells [16,61,62].",

Type I interferons IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2 can be produced by most cell types and are the major effector cytokines of the host immune response against viral infections. However, the production of type I interferons is also induced in response to bacterial infections [64]. The type II interferon IFN\u03b3 plays an important role during the immune response to bacterial pathogens, but is also induced upon infection with viruses. It is produced predominantly by natural killer (NK) cells and natural killer T cells as part of the innate immune response and by Th1 CD4+ and CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte effector T cells once antigen-specific immunity develops [65]. In the present study CEACAM5 is up-regulated in NHBE cells by IFN\u03b3, but not by type I interferons, and CEACAM1 is increased by type I and type II interferons (IFN\u03b2 and IFN\u03b3, Figure 3B and D). While for CEACAM1, CEACAM5 and CEACAM6 an up-regulation by IFN\u03b3 and viral infections has been described in epithelial cells [55,66-70], to our knowledge this is the first report that also type I interferons enhance CEACAM1 expression.",

It was shown recently that poly I:C enhances the susceptibility to secondary pulmonary infections by gram-positive bacteria in a mouse model [76]. The positive-stranded RNA virus rhinovirus enhances CEACAM5 expression in human nasal epithelial cells and two negative-stranded RNA viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV-3), enhance CEACAM1 expression in A549 and NHBE cells [67,77]. Since the latter viruses have to be recognized via TLR7 or TLR8, this is the first indication that the pathogen receptor CEACAM1 might also be up-regulated by positive-stranded RNA viruses via TLR3.",

One of the underlying mechanisms for the colonization of COPD patients by M. catarrhalis and NTHi may consist of the up-regulation of specific host receptors, i.e. CEACAM1, by viral infections, as described for several CEA family receptors [55,66,68,77]. For pathogenic Neisseria it was demonstrated that increased CEACAM expression levels correlated with an increase in bacterial invasion [55,79]. Once established, M. catarrhalis and NTHi themselves are also able to increase the expression of their receptor CEACAM1. Whether the starting point is a viral or bacterial pathogen, the result is a continual cycle of infection-induced increase in cytokine levels and, subsequently, receptor expression which then promotes bacterial invasion. Since viruses also recruit CEACAMs, elevated CEACAM expression might aid viral infection as well [80,81].",

While we did not find a direct correlation between CEACAM expression and COPD, these COPD-linked bacteria were able to increase the expression of their own receptor on host cells. We also propose a role for the constitutively expressed CEACAM6 as well as CEACAM1 and CEACAM5 in the phenomenon of increased host susceptibility to bacterial infection upon viral challenge in the human respiratory tract, as it occours for example in COPD patients, since either enhanced CEACAM1 expression induced by viruses or the COPD-associated changes in the function of the mucociliary clearance that will allow an easy access to CEACAMs on respiratory epithelia are likely to increase bacterial colonization.",
