The global distribution of the pandemic prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century in June 2009. Influenza transmission is thought to occur primarily via droplet spread and contact transmission, although droplet nuclei transmission is also likely.7\u20139 Transmission of 2009 H1N1 and other respiratory viruses is facilitated by crowded and confined environments.10\u201312 The first confirmed case of 2009 H1N1 infection was identified on 11 May 2009 in mainland China.13,14 Since then, transmission patterns evolved rapidly from a few imported cases to sustained community level transmission and outbreaks.15 Through 21 July 2009, a total of 1762 confirmed 2009 H1N1 cases were reported in the country, 75% of which were imported cases.",

The announcements requested passengers and staff to present themselves to local public health authorities for evaluation. Professional staff at local CDCs administered a screening questionnaire to respondents. Respondents who had a history of ARI or who had been in the train car with a confirmed case-patient were investigated. Trained interviewers collected information from passengers, crew, and health care workers by using a structured questionnaire that included items on demographic characteristics, symptoms, date of illness onset, and travel history. Quarantine either at designated hospitals or at home was imposed when professionals confirmed the presence of symptoms. We also collected information from the Chinese Ministry of Railways to investigate the internal environment of the train, including air conditioning, the cafeteria, seating locations, capacity, timetable, crew, passengers, and structure.",

Other explanations cannot be ruled out. Indeed, other passengers or crew might have acquired infection before boarding the train and experienced longer incubation periods.

The long distance and duration of the trip (41 hours) as well as close contact in the train may have increased the probability of communicable disease transmission.18 We do not know when the index case-patient was infected, but we inferred that she acquired infection before boarding the train, after which she spread it to other passengers and crew.",

Frequent transport alters the model of disease transmission for new and re-emerging diseases, including 2009 H1N1 and tuberculosis, which can both spread in trains. Because it is more difficult to identify sources of infection, control of communicable diseases may be more challenging in this setting.
