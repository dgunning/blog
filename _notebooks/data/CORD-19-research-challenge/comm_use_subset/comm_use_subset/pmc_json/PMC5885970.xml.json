Due to widespread use of diphtheria\u2013tetanus\u2013pertussis (DTP) vaccine globally, the incidence has steadily declined over time, and thus, diphtheria is commonly perceived as a disease of pre-vaccination era. Nevertheless, sporadic cases and even epidemics of the disease have been yet reported especially in politically unstable areas, and many cases have been considered as arising from susceptible pockets of the vulnerable population (Rusmil et al., 2015; Hosseinpoor et al., 2016; Sangal et al., 2017).",

The basic reproduction number, R0, is interpreted as the average number of secondary cases that are produced by a single primary case in a fully susceptible population, acting as the critical measure of the transmissibility. To date, an explicit epidemiological estimate of R0 for diphtheria has been reported only by Anderson & May (1982): using a static modeling approach to age-dependent incidence data with an assumption of the endemic equilibrium, R0 was estimated as 6.6 in Pennsylvania, 1910s and 6.4 in Virginia and New York from 1934 to 1947. Subsequently, a few additional modeling studies of diphtheria took place (Kolibo & Romaniuk, 2001; Sornbundit, Triampo & Modchang, 2017; Torrea, Ortega & Torera, 2017), but none of these offered an empirical estimate of R0.",

Figure 1 shows the latest available epidemic curve. As of December 26, 2017 (the latest date of observation), a total of 2,526 cases have been reported. Cases consist of (i) confirmed cases: cases reported as positive for C. diphtheriae by multiplex assay, (ii) probable cases: cases with upper respiratory tract illness with laryngitis or nasopharyngitis or tonsillitis AND sore throat or difficulty swallowing and an adherent membrane (pseudomembrane) OR gross cervical lymphadenopathy, and (iii) suspected cases: any case with a clinical suspicion of diphtheria, including cases that are unclassified due to missing values (World Health Organization (WHO), 2017b). Prior to December 11, 2017, cases satisfied only the condition of suspected cases. The definition was improved on and after December 12 (World Health Organization (WHO), 2017c), enforcing to count mainly probable cases, while not restricting the reporting of suspected cases. For this reason, cases reported by December 11 are considered to have been likely over-ascertained compared with cases that were reported later under improved case definition. Mass child vaccination started on December 12, and according to the administrative coverage, greater than 90% vaccination coverage was achieved by December 30 (World Health Organization (WHO), 2018). Vaccine-induced immunity requires at least 7\u201314 days to become effective, and moreover, the reporting delay was assumed to be about four days (based on additional analyses; results not shown). For these reasons, the dataset from December 23\u201326 was discarded as the number of cases may be influenced by emergency vaccination and also biased by the reporting delay.",

We assume that secondary transmission does not take place before illness onset. According to a classical study by Stocks (1930) in the United Kingdom (UK), the time interval from first to second diphtheria cases in the household revealed a bimodal shape. Following Klinkenberg & Nishiura (2011), the first peak corresponds to an independent infection in the community and the second peak reflects within-household transmission. As one of peak time-lags in the observed time interval was observed on day 8, we assumed that the mean serial interval was eight days, and we imposed an assumption that the coefficient of variation (CV) of the serial interval distribution was 50%, and later varied it from 25% to 75% as part of the sensitivity analysis.",

Thus, it is vital to quantify R0 while accounting for the uncertainty of other model parameters. In the present study, \u03bd was estimated through uncertainty analysis, while \u03b1t was estimated as a step function governed by two parameters, a1 and a2. Uncertainty in parameter values can be addressed by randomly sampling the uncertain parameter value from probability distributions (Gilbert et al., 2014). Here we use the Latin Hypercube sampling (LHS) method (Sanchez & Blower, 1997) in which a symmetric triangular distribution of \u03bd was assumed to be in the range from 0.0 to 0.7; the health survey of Rohingya population indicated that overall 30.8% of children had received no vaccinations (Guzek et al., 2017), and the remaining 69.2% receives at least a single immunization, which is not necessarily against diphtheria, thus, vaccination coverage for diphtheria should be less than 69.2%. Thus, we expect that the actual coverage is nearby the mid-point of the range from 0.0 to 0.7. In addition, we examined the sensitivity of R0 to variations in the length of the serial interval.",

Similarly, R0 was positively correlated with ascertainment rates, a1 and a2. While the ascertainment might have been lowered due to the stricter case definition, the small estimate of a2 can also indicate that a substantial fraction of undiagnosed individuals existed and the susceptible fraction was then gradually depleted in the population.

We have shown that the frequently quoted estimate agrees well with dynamically estimated R0 from the refugee camp in the present day. Assuming R0 = 7, to control diphtheria by means of mass vaccination, the coverage greater than 86% must be satisfied. Since our study focused on uncertainty and sensitivity analyses, the exact estimate of R0 cannot be pointed out. However, despite the uncertainty regarding \u03bd in this population, we estimated a distribution of R0 consistent with previous estimates. While the mode of distribution for R0 was 6.7, the validity of this value depends on the validity of our prior distribution of \u03bd, which was not supported by any published evidence of this refugee population. Nevertheless, a Demographic and Health Survey data of the Rohingya population in Myanmar indicated a close value from 40% to 50% as the coverage of DTP (Ministry of Health and Sports, 2017).

Even without explicit estimate of the initially immune fraction, we have shown that an indication of the possible value of R0 can be obtained through uncertainty analysis. LHS appeared to be particularly useful in the setting of refugee camp in which the background health status is not well quantified (Helton & Davis, 2002; Nishiura et al., 2017). LHS can offer probabilistic distribution of the outcome measure, R0 in our case, and this method appeared to be particularly useful when one or more uncertain input information exist (Elderd, Dukic & Dwyer, 2006; Coelho, Code\u00e7o & Struchiner, 2008; Samsuzzoha, Singh & Lucy, 2013; Gilbert et al., 2014). While Bayesian modeling has replaced LHS to some extent of uncertainty analysis as it can also offer posterior distributions of even uncertain parameters (Elderd, Dukic & Dwyer, 2006; Coelho, Code\u00e7o & Struchiner, 2008), there could be an issue of identifiability when two or more parameters are evidently correlated, e.g., as anticipated between R0 and \u03bd in our model (4). In such an instance, we cannot be sure if the limited epidemic data with the Bayesian estimation method can offer identifiable distributions for all parameters, and then LHS can remain to act as a useful tool for uncertainty analysis.",

No heterogeneous patterns of transmission, including contact patterns and age-dependency were taken into account due to shortage of information. In addition, the time-dependent heterogeneity, including the reduced transmission potential due to contact tracing and rapid hospitalization, was not explicitly taken into account due to insufficiency of the data. If there were any additional indications or datasets that would allow explicit quantification of the effective reproduction number from December 12, that could give additional insights into the success of control measures. Second, for similar reasons, no spatial information was explicitly incorporated into the model. Third, a little more realistic features of refugee population, such as the impact of migration on the epidemic were unfortunately discarded in the present study. Similarly, one could investigate how overcrowding and malnutrition in the deprived population would help enhance the spread of diphtheria, given sufficient data backup from epidemiological investigations.",

Since previously immune fraction \u03bd of the refugee population was not precisely known, uncertainty analysis of R0 was conducted with an input parameter assumption for \u03bd employing the LHS. R0 ranged from 4.7 to 14.8 with the median estimate at 7.2. LHS can offer probabilistic distribution of the outcome measure, and this method appeared to be particularly useful in the setting of refugee camp in which the background health status is poorly quantified.",
