Her first symptoms were a runny nose on 26 January and nausea on 27 January. Because of high fever (39 \u00b0C), weakness and cough she sought medical attention on 28 January. Suspicion of COVID-19 led to her direct transfer to the Lapland Central Hospital in Rovaniemi, where she was isolated and sampled on 28 and 29 January for laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 1). SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed from nasopharyngeal samples on 29 January by the Helsinki University Hospital Laboratory (HUSLAB), and further confirmed at the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) (Table). Both laboratories performed real-time RT-PCR testing for three targets: the envelope (E), the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the nucleocapsid (N). Primers and probes were based on the Corman et al. method [2]. Cycle threshold (Ct) values above 37 were considered negative.",

The samples were inoculated into the cells for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 and fresh culture medium (Eagle's minimum essential medium (EMEM) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.6 \u03bcg/mL penicillin, 60 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 20 mM HEPES) were added for incubation. On the 4th day of incubation, half of the cultures were blind-passaged onto fresh Vero E6 cells and the rest of original passages were incubated further. After 4 days incubation a clear CPE was detected in the NPA-originated passage 2. The propagation of stock virus was done by passaging a low virus dose once again in Vero E6 cells, and virus culture was harvested on the 3rd day. Virus concentration was followed by RT-PCR. The Ct value for virus passage 1 on the 6th day of incubation was 17.65 and for passage 2 on the 2nd day, before any CPE was 20.63, whereas those of the NPS specimen remained at Ct values between 35 and 36.",

However, hCoV OC43 and 229E samples can also cross-react with SARS-CoV ELISA testing [15]. The SARS-CoV-2 CPE-based MN test using live virus appeared to be very specific, while laborious to conduct requiring a BSL-3 laboratory. An increase of at least 4-fold in the neutralising antibodies indicating a positive response was detected at Day 9\u201310 after the first symptoms and at Day 20, the antibody levels were still increasing. Our findings indicate that the MN assay is specific for functional SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and could be applied in surveillance of population immunity for this virus. The assay can be used as confirmatory tool for SARS-CoV-2 specificity in the development of more accessible diagnostic tools such as assays based on detecting binding antibodies. Previous studies on patients with SARS-CoV infection indicated that the median time for seroconversion was 20 days, by which time 60\u201375% of patients had IgG against the virus [13,16]. That IgM and IgG antibodies were present within 2 weeks from the onset of symptoms in our study suggests that early convalescent patients may be suitable sources of therapeutic antibodies [17]. In accordance with our finding, a recent preprint report on patients admitted to hospital with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in China indicated that the median time to seroconversion was 11\u201314 days, depending on the immunological assay used [18].",
