White blood cells use small pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines as molecular signaling mechanisms to communicate with each other. Cytokines become elevated in response to the bacterial and viral causes of BRD [2\u20134]. The profiles of the most studied cytokines (TNF, INF\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6) vary depending on which pathogen the animal is infected with [4]. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the transcript abundance of multiple cytokine genes and receptors in calves at different production stages (i.e. preconditioning and weaning), and when BRD was detected to determine whether changes in blood cell counts and/or changes in the expression of specific cytokines might indicate which animals were sick or more likely to become sick with BRD.",

This breeding population includes contributions from the following 18 breeds: Angus, Beefmaster, Brahman, Brangus, Braunvieh, Charolais, Chiangus, Gelbvieh, Hereford, Limousin, Maine Anjou, Red Angus, Salers, Santa Gertrudis, Shorthorn, South Devon, Simmental, and Tarentaise. Calves were part of a subset developed to monitor disease. Calves were all born and raised at USMARC at three locations with no fenceline contact. At pre-conditioning (~ 120 days of age), which is preweaning vaccination with Bovi Shield Gold One Shot (Zoetis) and Vision 8 with SPUR (Merck, USA) and at weaning (~ 150 days) with the vaccination Bovi Shield Gold One Shot, blood was collected as previously described [1]. Briefly, whole blood was collected into tubes containing liquid EDTA as an anticoagulant for a complete blood count (CBC) from 796 animals at pre-conditioning and 791 animals at weaning, when calves were relocated from pasture to a feedlot. At the same times, whole blood from a randomly selected subset of these animals (n = 200) was also collected into Tempus RNA Blood tubes (Thermo, Waltham, MA, USA) for RNA isolation. Samples in Tempus tubes were stored at \u2212 20 \u00b0C prior to RNA isolation. After weaning, calves were monitored for 42 days for clinical signs of BRD, including cough, nasal discharge, increased respiratory rate, and lethargy. Whole blood from calves diagnosed with BRD (n = 13) and asymptomatic control animals (n = 75) were collected as described above for CBC. If the animal with BRD was previously included in the subset of animals with blood drawn into Tempus tubes, another Tempus tube was drawn at the time of diagnosis (n = 5). Healthy, control animals from the same or nearby pens that had samples previously collected in Tempus tubes (n = 9), were also collected into a new Tempus blood tube. Nasal swabs were also collected from the upper nasal cavity of case and control animals for pathogen detection.",

The Tempus Spin RNA isolation kit (Thermo) was used to isolate RNA following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Quality of RNA was assessed using a Bioanalyzer 2200 Tape Station (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). All samples produced RNA integrity values (RIN) of > 8. The RT2 First Strand Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) was used for cDNA preparation from 1 \u03bcg of total RNA. The cDNA was diluted with water and added to the RT2 SYBR Green Mastermix for a final reaction volume of 25 \u03bcL. The master mix with cDNA was placed into the wells of the Bovine Inflammatory Cytokine and Receptor PCR Array (Catalog #PABT-011Z; Qiagen) plates for the purpose of assessing the level of transcript abundance of 84 different immune genes. Thermal cycling conditions on a CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) were: 95 \u00b0C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s and 60 \u00b0C for 1 min. Data were entered into the Qiagen RT2 profiler data analysis software (http://pcrdataanalysis.sabiosciences.coms/pcr/arrayanalysis.php). The gene hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1) was chosen as the housekeeping gene for normalization because it was the most stable of the five housekeeping genes on the plates between the BRD positive and control animals. The 2\u2212\u0394\u0394CT method [7] was used to calculate the expression values for all 84 genes and these values were used to evaluate these genes for differential expression between sick and asymptomatic animals.",

Each cytokine was analyzed in a separate mixed model analysis with 5 hematological cell counts: neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. Six cytokines or receptors were eliminated from mixed model analysis because of more than 5 missing values (> 10% missing); hence, we ran 78 mixed model analyses. For each analysis we included 36 equations for fixed effects; 4 phenotype (sick verses healthy) by time point subclasses times 6 traits; 5 CBC cell counts and transcript abundance for one cytokine. For random animal effects there were 534 equations, 89 animals times 6 traits. In a 6 \u00d7 6 variance covariance matrix, there are 21 unique variances and covariances. We estimated 2 variance\u2013covariance matrices, one for animal effects and 1 for temporary environmental effects for a total of 42 variances and covariances. We used REML combined with a Cholesky decomposition to constrain the variance matrix to be positive definite in R using optim() using method = \u201cL-BFGS-B. Differences between sick and healthy animals at diagnosis were tested using an F test with 1 df for the numerator and 83 df for the denominator for cell counts and 8 df for the denominator for cytokine expression. Experiment-wise type I error was controlled for multiple testing of 84 genes using a Bonferroni adjustment. The multiple trait mixed model analysis incorporates indirect information from CBC to help estimate and interpret cytokine expression levels where information was more limited.",

For bacterial diagnostics, two techniques were used. First, a set of nasal swabs was sent to the University of Nebraska Lincoln Veterinary Diagnostic Center for bacterial culture and identification. Second, variable regions 1 through 3 in the 16S ribosomal RNA gene were sequenced and bacterial taxa were identified as previously described [10]. Viral pathogens associated with BRD were detected in nasal swabs from 11 of 13 cases. Six were positive for BCV, three were positive for BCV and BRSV, and two were positive for BRSV. Bacterial culture techniques identified Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, or Histophilus somni in calves diagnosed with BRD. In addition, evaluation of the microbiome through sequencing identified predominant bacteria genera previously reported to be associated with cattle diagnosed with BRDC including Mycoplasma sp. and Psychrobacter sp.

Specifically, human monocytes have been shown to respond to respiratory syncytial virus by increasing expression of CCR1 receptors [13]. Mice lacking the CCR1 gene produce little if any inflammatory responses during the acute phase of viral pneumonia [14]. The pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) produces similar chemokine responses as human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). In this study, we detected an increase in the transcript abundance of CCR1 at the time of illness. Moreover, of the five sick animals, one tested positive for bovine BRSV and two were positive for BCV.",

In general, illness was low for the season with only 13 of the 791 weaned calves diagnosed with BRD. Because BRD is a phenotypic measurement of symptoms, it is possible that some cases were not identified. We intend to repeat this experiment to increase the population size of sick animals and will use RNA-Seq to evaluate the sick and control animals from this study and the repeated study. This will allow us to detect the expression levels of all genes expressed in the leukocytes, including the genes evaluated in this study.",
