In this context, we asked if statistical methods that consider long-term EMR data patterns could benefit ARI epidemic detection. Because most ARI result from viral diseases that exhibit marked seasonality, we hypothesized that fitting multi-year time-series of daily ARI case counts with seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models [15, 16] could accelerate epidemic detection, compared to methods that base their forecasting on the recent past only [17]. To begin to test this hypothesis, we used software to recreate surveillance systems operating prospectively on synthetic or authentic historical datasets. Our results suggest that, under realistic surveillance conditions, SARIMA could help shorten outbreak detection delay.",

Peabody MA) and transferred to relational databases (SQL Server 2008, Microsoft Corp, Redmond CA). We used case detection algorithms (CDA) previously developed against a manual record review seeking reference ARI cases, defined as: [Positive influenza culture/antigen OR Any two of the following, of no more than 7 days duration: cough; fever or chills or night sweats; pleuritic chest pain; myalgia; sore throat; headache] AND Illness not attributable to a non-infectious etiology [8]. We chose the following ARI CDAs: a) CDA1 (sensitivity 63%, positive predictive value (PPV) 13%) retrieved outpatient visits where provider assigned a diagnostic code (International Classification of Diseases, 9th version) included in an ARI-related set used by a surveillance system of national scope [19]; b) CDA2 (sensitivity 69%, PPV 54%) retrieved outpatient visits assigned a diagnostic code that belonged to a grouping modified for increased performance at the VA [8]), and where automated text analysis of the visit-related clinical note(s) identified at least two symptoms from the above ARI case definition [8, 20]. CDA2 was chosen because its use resulted in the highest epidemic detection performance amongst eight (8) alternative ARI case-detection methods [10], illustrating the gains in system performance that could be achieved by combining different EMR data fields compared to using diagnostic codes alone; c) CDA3 retrieved CDA2 patients subset with a core body temperature of more than 37.8\u00b0C measured on the day of their index visit (sensitivity 71%, PPV 68%). Our rationale for choosing CDA3 was that while its high performance could translate into timely epidemic detection, low daily case counts could represent a challenging substrate for time series modeling. To generate CDA-specific time series of daily case counts, each ARI CDA was applied to a relational database containing EMR documentation of outpatient clinical encounters [8] over a 7-year period, from January 1999 to December 2005. These time series formed the basis for the authentic \u201cbackgrounds\u201d used for the whole-system simulations (see Fig 1A (insert), Table 1, and S1 File). EMR data included in CDA 1\u20133 have been extracted daily at the VAMHCS. Thus, any of the CDA tested could be incorporated in a prospective surveillance system.",

The software began a surveillance cycle on the day when the modeled epidemic signal was injected into a background time series. Starting on the injection day, and then daily for a total of 80 days, a statistical outbreak detection method (see below) was applied in parallel to the background+epidemic (Combined) time series, and to the \u201cBackground-only\u201d time series. The value of the statistic for each day was stored for subsequent analysis. The 80-day surveillance cycle was repeated, each time shifting the outbreak injection to a different week of the two, one-year study periods (from August 1st 2002 to July 31st 2003, and from August 1st 2003 to July 31st 2004). In a final phase, the software applied a family of threshold values beyond which the computed daily statistics would constitute an \u201calarm\u201d. On a given day and for a given threshold, an alarm that originated in the Background-only time series was considered a \u201cfalse alarm\u201d. An alarm present in the Combined dataset but absent from the Background-only dataset was considered a \u201ctrue alarm\u201d (Fig 1B and 1C). For a given alarm threshold, the software computed two benchmarks: 1) the \u201cDetection Delay\u201d, the time from outbreak injection to the first true alarm, averaged for the 52 weekly surveillance cycles for a given one-year study period; 2) the daily false alarm rate (FAR), defined as the number of unique false alarms during the evaluation year, divided by 365 days. Corresponding pairs of Detection Delay and FAR were computed over broad ranges of alarm thresholds and used to plot CDA-specific activity monitoring operating characteristic (AMOC) curves [23].",

We avoided the time period immediately following the public announcement of the pandemic, as this period contained many visits from worried individuals but only sporadic laboratory-confirmed pH1N1 cases. Our comparison period thus began on May 24 and ended August 22, before the very large second wave of the epidemic reached Baltimore.

The algorithms used to detect single ARI cases impacted both the feasibility of SARIMA modeling and the magnitude of the SARIMA-related gains in detection timeliness. Under plausible conditions for our local health system, SARIMA could speed up epidemic detection by several days, a meaningful improvement considering how rapidly influenza can spread through a community [28].",

A graphical representation of this relationship intuitively informed a performance trade-off of key concern to public health practitioners.",

            "text": "Many statistical aberrancy detection methods have been described for epidemic surveillance [17, 30\u201334], including time series modeling [31, 35, 36]. Some of these methods have been applied to the same data sets and formally compared [18, 37\u201340]. Of the two studies that addressed the value of historical data, a generalized linear model (GLM) that took advantage of 3 years of past data often outperformed EARS [39], whereas a seasonally adjusted cumulative sum (CUSUM) method did not [18]. Even though a number of explanations could help reconcile these results, we note that as the size of an epidemic signal increases relative to the background noise, outbreak recognition becomes easier and the performance of alternative detection methods becomes more and more difficult to distinguish [39, 41]. This rationale could explain why the GLM approach implemented by Jackson et al. did not add value under all conditions, but performed well with slow-escalating outbreaks qualitatively similar to the one used in our study [39]. In our particular real-world case, we found SARIMA to be more sensitive than EARS at discovering signals related to the pH1N1 pandemic wave that hit Baltimore in the summer of 2009. However, there was no associated timeliness advantage to SARIMA, as the initial peak of ARI cases was large enough to be picked by both statistical approaches. Given the variability in real-world outbreak signals, a negative finding for one specific outbreak does not reduce the impetus to design ever more sensitive and specific surveillance systems.",

Because we had previously measured the performance of these CDAs relative to a large reference record review [8], we could augment the realism of our simulations by discounting the injected epidemic according to CDA sensitivity. This simulation framework supplied information that may prove helpful to public health practitioners: 1) insight into the achievable gains in detection timeliness could help justify investing into more complex epidemic detection approaches; 2) AMOC curves could be used to: a) adjust outbreak detection sensitivity according to a local jurisdiction\u2019s capacity to investigate alerts; or b) to estimate how much resources should be reallocated to surveillance activities during periods of increased threat [42].",
