            "text": "Cancer gene therapy has faced a problem common to all forms of gene therapy, namely the lack of a systemically\u2010administered, safe and efficient vector to deliver the gene of interest at the diseased site. Animal viruses have been shown to be capable of ligand\u2010targeted gene delivery, but they require the elimination of their native tropism for mammalian cells so that they can be re\u2010targeted at alternative receptors (Hajitou et al., 2006a; Hajitou, 2010), which results in reduced efficacy (Allen et al., 2006; Ghosh and Barry, 2005; Hajitou et al., 2006a; Hajitou, 2010). Incorporation of targeting peptides derived from in vivo phage display screenings into viral vectors has been attempted, but with little success because either the ligand destroys the vector or the vector destroys the ligand (Ghosh and Barry, 2005; Hajitou, 2010). A solution to this limitation may be to use bacteriophage as the gene delivery vehicle (Hajitou et al., 2006a; Hajitou, 2010; Larocca et al., 1998; Poul and Marks, 1999). This eliminates the need to transfer peptides from phage display to a eukaryotic virus, and no native tropism for mammalian cells needs to be circumvented. Bacteriophage are safe and can be targeted by a ligand displayed on their capsid to a specific mammalian receptor after systemic administration (Hajitou, 2010). Unfortunately, phage particles are considered to be poor vectors, nevertheless, as they have evolved to infect bacteria only and, therefore, have no intrinsic strategies for delivering genes to mammalian cells.",

            "text": "To overcome this limitation, we have recently generated an improved version of such phage\u2010based vectors as hybrids between two single stranded DNA viruses; adeno\u2010associated virus (AAV) and M13 phage (termed AAV/Phage; AAVP). Within this novel vector, a targeted phage capsid serves as a vehicle to deliver a recombinant rAAV mammalian DNA cassette incorporated into an intergenomic region of the bacteriophage genome (Hajitou et al., 2006b). This vector showed superior gene delivery compared to a regular phage vector with long\u2010term gene expression in vivo after systemic delivery (Hajitou et al., 2006b). We found that this improved mammalian transduction efficiency is associated with several factors: the improved fate of the delivered gene through maintenance of the entire mammalian transgene cassette, better persistence of episomal DNA, and formation of concatamers of the AAV transgene cassette (Hajitou et al., 2006b, 2007). In these previous studies, we used AAVP displaying the cyclic RGD4C (CDCRGDCFC) peptide ligand to target overexpressed \u03b1v integrins in tumors. Therapeutic genes were successfully delivered to the tumor site in mice and rats while sparing the normal organs after intravenous administration (Hajitou et al., 2006b, 2007, 2008; Tandle et al., 2009; Trepel et al., 2009). A recent study carried out under the direction of the National Cancer Institute of the USA has elegantly confirmed the potential of this technology (Paoloni et al., 2009). Targeted AAVP was used to deliver a cytokine, tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), to cancers diagnosed in pet dogs. Repeated doses proved safe and resulted in complete eradication of aggressive tumors in some of these dogs (Paoloni et al., 2009).",

            "text": "It is clear that AAVP represent a new generation of phage\u2010based vectors that have promise. However, due to inherent limitations of bacteriophage, they need to be improved to enable them to overcome intracellular barriers in mammalian cells. Phage internalization assays have shown that 100% of cells in vitro internalize the targeted phage via a receptor\u2010mediated endocytosis, only as few as 10% of cells actually express the transgene (Hajitou et al., 2007). This is probably due to the fact that, unlike eukaryotic viruses, bacteriophage have no strategies to evade the barriers to infective agents that mammalian cells present. Proteasomes are one of these barriers. They are multi\u2010subunit enzymes responsible for the degradation of many cytosolic proteins (e.g. misfolded proteins, cyclins, and transcription factors) and for processing foreign proteins prior to the deployment of cellular immune responses (Groll et al., 1997; Kisselev, 2008; Tanaka et al., 2012). Numerous previous studies have reported the proteasome as an obstacle to some eukaryotic viral vectors (Monahan et al., 2010). Furthermore, cancers possess an elevated level of proteasome activity (Chen and Dou, 2010; Kisselev, 2008; Wu et al., 2010). It would therefore seem likely that the activity of proteasomes represents one possible barrier to the efficient delivery of AAVP vectors to cancer cells.",

The MG132 and LLnL are peptide aldehyde inhibitors that reversibly inhibit the 26S proteasome activity (Kisselev and Goldberg, 2001; Lu et al., 2006; Masdehors et al., 2000; Vinitsky et al., 1992), and most widely used in proteasome inhibition studies (Gartel, 2010; Granot et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2006). We found that combination of proteasome inhibitors with RGD4C/AAVP resulted in significantly improved reporter gene expression in vitro and in vivo, and better tumor cell killing than the vector alone. Next, we established that this improved efficacy is associated with better persistence of the AAVP particles both in vitro and in vivo and with increased polyubiquitination of the AAVP coat proteins, when used in combination with a proteasome inhibitor. Our results strongly suggest that supplementary proteasome inhibition should be considered as the potential of AAVP vectors is further explored.",

Thus, we transduced the \u03b1v integrin\u2010expressing HEK293 cells with RGD4C/AAVP vector and assessed the effect of MG132. We chose the HEK293 cell line for initial experiments because these cells have extensively been used as a standard in vitro model to characterize cell transduction by RGD4C/AAVP since they express high levels of \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 integrins (Hajitou et al., 2006b; Hajitou et al., 2007). Also, despite the presence of these integrin subunits in the HEK293 cell line, RGD4C/AAVP mediates only very modest transgene expression in these cells. Therefore, it is possible that the vector is able to access the cell cytoplasm and efficacy may be reduced by proteasomal degradation. In order to assess whether gene transfer efficiency by AAVP is reduced by proteasome activity, the efficacy of transduction was evaluated in the presence of increasing concentrations of MG132. HEK293 cells were incubated with RGD4C/AAVP or control non\u2010targeted vector bearing the GFP or Luc reporter genes. The results showed that efficiency of gene\u2010transfer by RGD4C/AAVP was strongly enhanced overtime by the addition of the proteasome inhibitor. For instance, at day 7 post\u2010transduction, when a maximum of transgene expression is achieved in HEK293 cells by RGD4C/AAVP, treatment with 5 \u03bcM MG132 resulted in increased number of GFP\u2010positive cells as shown by fluorescence images of RGD4C/AAVP\u2010mediated GFP expression in HEK293 cells (Supplementary Figure 1A).

We conducted efficacy studies of proteasome inhibition on RGD4C/AAVP efficiency in the Human M21 melanoma cells known for their expression of the \u03b1v integrin receptors for RGD4C ligand (Hood et al., 2002; Tandle et al., 2009). Additionally, to rule out the possibility that the observed effects of MG132 and LLnL are tumor specific, we analyzed efficacy of these drugs on the human U87 and rat 9L glioblastoma cells. First, we set to determine the sensitivity of cancer cells to increasing concentrations of MG132 and LLnL. Thus, the cytotoxicity of the drugs was investigated in vitro on M21, U87 and 9L cancer cell lines. Tumor cells were treated with various concentrations of MG132 or LLnL ranging from 0.002 \u03bcM to 2000 \u03bcM and compared to non\u2010treated cells. In all cell lines, cell survival in the presence of MG132 or LLnL decreased as the concentration of the drug increased (Figure 1). Unlike LLnL, cell viability assays showed that MG132 was more toxic on the M21 cell line than U87 and 9L cells as a rapid death of M21 cells (75%) already started at MG132 concentrations as low as 0.02 \u03bcM, while this dose induced a slight toxicity only on U87 and 9L cells (Figure 1A). Cytotoxic doses expressed as IC50 values, corresponding to inhibitory concentration required to reduce the cell survival by 50%, are shown by the lines on the graphs to approximate the IC50 value (Figure 1). We found that 50% of cell death in the presence of MG132 was induced by \u223c0.01 \u03bcM in M21 cells, while in U87 cells and 9L, 50% of cell death was obtained with 1 \u03bcM and 5.733 \u03bcM of MG132, respectively (Figure 1A). The IC50 of LLnL were 48.65 \u03bcM for M21 cells, 18.58 \u03bcM for U87 and 112.2 \u03bcM for 9L cells (Figure 1B). MG132 concentrations used in subsequent experiments to assess effect on gene delivery by AAVP vector ranged below the IC50 and cause little to no toxicity. Accordingly, we selected MG132 concentrations of 0.0035 \u03bcM for M21 cells, 0.3 \u03bcM for U87 and 0.2 \u03bcM for 9L cells. In contrast, the concentrations of LLnL tested in following experiments were markedly higher than that of MG132 and reached 10 \u03bcM for M21, 20 \u03bcM for U87 and 2 \u03bcM for 9L cells.",

The data showed that GFP expression was generally stronger over time in cells that received a combination of RGD4C/AAVP\u2010GFP and MG132 compared with cells treated with vector alone (Figure 2A left panel). For instance, at 5 days post\u2010vector transduction, we observed GFP expression in \u223c21% of the M21 cells transduced by the RGD4C/AAVP\u2010GFP construct in the presence of MG132 compared to \u223c11% of cells transduced by RGD4C/AAVP\u2010GFP vector alone (Figure 2A left panel).

Next, to confirm that RGD4C/AAVP and MG132 combination improves gene delivery in tumor cells, we carried out a quantitative analysis of transgene expression by using AAVP\u2010Luc vectors expressing the firefly Luc reporter gene. Consistently with GFP reporter transgene expression experiments, we observed a significant increase in RGD4C/AAVP\u2010mediated Luc expression by MG132 treatment compared to untreated and transduced cells (Figure 2B left panel). For instance, at day 3 post\u2010vector transduction, MG132 boosted Luc activity by \u223c2.6\u2010, \u223c3.5\u2010 and \u223c1.97\u2010fold in RGD4C/AAVP\u2010transduced M21, U87 and 9L cells, respectively (Figure 2B left panel).",

The MG132 drug has been commonly used for in vivo studies in mice (Grimes et al., 2005). We used a standard experimental setup for in vivo imaging of the Luc transgene reporter, and assessed the bioluminescence imaging (BLI) for noninvasive monitoring of temporal dynamics and spatial heterogeneity of Luc expression in living, tumor\u2010bearing mice. As an initial preclinical model, we used immunodeficient nude mice bearing subcutaneous tumors derived from M21 melanoma cells. Indeed, the M21\u2010derived tumor model in nude mice was previously used to assess efficacy of targeted tumor transduction in vivo by RGD4C/AAVP vector following intravenous administration of vector to tumor\u2010bearing mice (Tandle et al., 2009). Moreover, M21 tumor cells induce moderately growing tumors allowing repetitive imaging of mice over time without reaching large size tumors to avoid animal suffering. By using repetitive BLI, we visualized and quantitated Luc expression in M21\u2010derived tumors over a time course after a single systemic administration of RGD4C/AAVP\u2010Luc, or control non\u2010targeted vectors alone or in combination with MG132. Consistent with our previous reports (Hajitou et al., 2006b, 2007; 2008; Tandle et al., 2009), Luc expression within M21 tumors was detectable at day 3 after RGD4C/AAVP\u2010Luc administration (Figure 3A). Interestingly, enhanced tumor expression of Luc gene was achieved at all time\u2010points (days 3\u201311) by RGD4C/AAVP\u2010Luc when used in combination with MG132 as compared to RGD4C/AAVP\u2010Luc vector alone (Figure 3A).

M21 tumor cells were transduced with either targeted RGD/AAVP vector or non\u2010targeted control in the presence or absence of MG132.

Our recent reports on the novel AAVP identify that these are promising vectors for targeted gene delivery for various diseases, including cancer. However, due to the low evolution profile of bacteriophage as bacteria viruses, the AAVP phage\u2010based vectors have to confront several barriers to accomplish effective gene delivery in mammalian cells. It is additionally widely accepted that human cancer cells possess elevated levels of proteasome activity, and are more sensitive to proteasome inhibitors than normal cells (Chen and Dou, 2010; Kisselev, 2008; Kisselev and Goldberg, 2001; Wu et al., 2010). Taking all of this evidence together, we hypothesized that our novel AAVP vector may have improved reporter gene delivery, and thus increased cancer cell killing, if it is used in conjunction with proteasome inhibitors.",

            "text": "Our initial studies in the HEK293 cells, an in vitro cellular model that has been used to characterize transduction by RGD4C/AAVP, indeed showed only modest gene expression even when using very high vector titers (Hajitou et al., 2007). This further supported the notion that our AAVP vector may be subjected to high levels of proteasomal degradation. We further investigated intracellular barriers to the RGD4C/AAVP vector in HEK293 cells and found that cell transduction in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 resulted in a strong increase in RGD4C/AAVP\u2010mediated gene transfer in vitro. We then confirmed that blocking the proteasome in various cancer cell lines results in increased reporter GFP and Luc transgene expression. These data are consistent with previous studies reporting an increase in GFP positive cells when transducing cells with lambda \u03bb phage in the presence of MG132 (Volcy and Dewhurst, 2009). Importantly, BLI of Luc experiments showed that treatment of tumor\u2010bearing mice with MG132 boosts targeted gene delivery to tumors following intravenous administration of RGD4C/AAVP. This report is the first to show efficacy of proteasome inhibiting drugs on targeted systemic gene delivery to tumors in vivo. In our studies, the increased recovery of integral and undamaged intracellular and intratumoral AAVP particles after blocking the proteasome indicates the AAVP phage particles are in fact susceptible to proteasomal degradation. Moreover, the increased polyubiquitination of AAVP particle coat proteins upon treatment with MG132 further confirms proteasomal degradation of AAVP. Indeed, it well known that the 26S proteasome accomplishes degradation of proteins labeled with polyubiquitin chains (Glickman and Ciechanover, 2002). After recognition by the 19S proteasome regulatory complex, polyubiquitin chains are disassembled and substrates are processed in the 20S core of proteasome. Numerous studies have shown that MG132 increases protein polyubiquitination (Yan et al., 2011). It is important to note that other mechanisms of action of MG132 should also account for its enhancing effect on cell transduction efficiency by RGD4C/AAVP. For instance, MG132 was reported to alter intracellular trafficking of some viruses (Denby et al., 2005; Yu and Lai, 2005). However, while reports showed that MG132 enhances nuclear delivery of viruses such as AAV (Denby et al., 2005), other studies reported lysosomal accumulation of viruses in the presence of MG132 (Yu and Lai, 2005). In the present work, as well as in other studies (Souza et al., 2006), confocal microscopic imaging of intracellular bacteriophage shows that RGD4C/phage particles have discrete and major vesicular localization. Yet, we did not detect any visible alteration of the vesicular pattern of RGD4C/AAVP particles following MG132 treatment (Supplementary Figure 3). Recently, we found that the majority of RGD4C/AAVP is sequestered in lysosomal vesicles upon entry into cells and that the minor cytoplasmic RGD4C/AAVP is invisible with confocal or electronic microscopic imaging (unpublished data). The RGD4C/AAVP phage particles might also have transient cytoplasmic passage, or enter the cytoplasm in a broken or uncoated shape. It should also be noted, however, that MG132 has been reported to inhibit lysosomal cathepsins in addition to the proteasome (Tsubuki et al., 1996). Additionally, it was shown that MG132 increases coxsackie and adenovirus receptor expression in a colon cancer cell line resulting in enhanced adenovirus transfer, targeted gene expression and oncolysis (Zhang et al., 2008). To date, we constantly observed that association of improved AAVP transduction efficiency with any significant change of AAVP distribution or compartmentalization is unnoticeable by microscopic imaging. In particular, MG132 shows some toxicity resulting in decreased experimental efficiency (Caron et al., 2004).",

            "text": "Collectively, our studies confirm the proteasome appears to be a significant barrier to the efficacy of targeted gene delivery by RGD4C/AAVP. Although animal viruses have developed strategies to resist and protect their proteins against proteasomal degradation, the proteasome has been shown to be a barrier to gene delivery by a number of eukaryotic viruses such as lentiviral vectors (Santoni de Sio et al., 2008). Viruses such as adeno\u2010associated virus, also appear to undergo ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome, and transgene expression by AAV vectors can be significantly enhanced in the presence of proteasome inhibitors (Jennings et al., 2005). It is understandable that phage, which has evolved to infect bacteria only, has no developed strategies to overcome the proteasome barrier in mammalian cells, which renders them susceptible to proteasomal degradation.",

However, the findings following analysis of the effect of LLnL on transgene expression by RGD4C/AAVP in M21 cells in vitro merit further discussion. Although, LLnL stimulated transgene expression by RGD4C/AAVP in the M21 cells, quantitative analysis of Luc expression revealed no significant difference between cells transduced with targeted RGD4C/AAVP alone and cells that received the combination of RGD4C/AAVP and LLnL. It is important to note that LLnL is considered to be a weak inhibitor of proteasomes compared to MG132. For example, transduction of human keratinocytes with a rAAV\u20102 in the presence of LLnL did not show any significant difference in transgene expression (Braun\u2010Falco et al., 2005). Additionally, transduction of human primary endothelial cells with rAAV\u20107 and rAAV\u20108 was much more pronounced in the presence of MG132 than with LLnL (Denby et al., 2005). Finally, in our present study, the effective LLnL doses used to improve the efficacy of AAVP were dramatically higher than that of MG132.",
