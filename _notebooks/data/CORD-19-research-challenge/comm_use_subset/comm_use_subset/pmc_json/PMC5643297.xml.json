However, human-to-human transmission underlies rapid spread of MERS-CoV within hospital settings.2 High seroprevalence of antibodies against MERS-CoV has been reported in dromedary camels in the Middle East and various countries in Africa indicating widespread MERS-CoV circulation.3\n",

Ongoing disease control strategies have so far relied on minimising contact with dromedary camels, observing standard infection control measures to limit nosocomial transmission, contact tracing and quarantine. Addressing this unmet need for MERS-CoV interventions has been prioritised by the WHO for urgent action4 and could most rapidly be achieved through a one health approach in which products are co-developed for use in humans (to prevent disease) and camels (to limit virus shedding and block subsequent transmission to humans). Leveraging vaccine technology platforms with an established safety profile in both these target species would allow relatively rapid progression through the product development pipeline.",

Among the most promising human vaccine platforms are replication-deficient simian adenovirus vectors (ChAd), which boasts a very good safety and immunogenicity profile in humans as demonstrated in clinical trials against a wide range of indications including malaria, HIV, tuberculosis, influenza, hepatitis C, Ebola and others.5 One ChAd vector, termed ChAdOx1,6 has undergone testing in dromedary camels, showing excellent safety and immunogenicity when encoding Rift Valley Fever viral glycoproteins.7 We recently made a vaccine construct, ChAdOx1 MERS,8 encoding the full-length MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein (GenBank accession number KJ650098.1) targeted by protective neutralising antibodies.9 The spike glycoprotein transgene sequence was inserted in the ChAdOx1 E1 region, included a human tissue plasminogen activator signal sequence in the N-terminus, and its expression was under the control of the human major immediate early cytomegalovirus promoter including intron A. ChAdOx1 MERS was shown to elicit high-titre MERS-CoV neutralising antibodies and a robust CD8+ T cell response against the spike glycoprotein.8 Here, to determine ChAdOx1 MERS vaccine efficacy we utilised a recently developed transgenic lethal BALB/c mouse model (van Doremalen et al., submitted) expressing the human dipeptidyl peptidase (hDPP4) gene in the Rosa26 locus, which renders mice susceptible to MERS-CoV infection.10 Infection with MERS-CoV in the hDPP4 mouse model is uniformly lethal with a dose of 103 TCID50 or higher. MERS-CoV infection is characterised by an initial respiratory phase and a secondary encephalitic phase, similar to what has been described previously.11\n",
