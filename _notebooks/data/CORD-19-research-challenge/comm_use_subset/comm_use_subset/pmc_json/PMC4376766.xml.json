Adenoviruses are non-enveloped, icosahedral, double-stranded DNA viruses with genomes of 26\u201345 kb [1]. The viral capsid is composed of two types of capsomeres: the hexon and the penton (which consists of the penton base and the fiber). Antigens at the surface of the virion are mainly type-specific [2,3]. Hexons are involved in neutralization, and fibers in neutralization and haemagglutination-inhibition. A recombinant that has a unique combination of these three regions (penton base; hexon loops; fiber knob) derived from previously recognized genotypes will be assign a new genotype (http://hadvwg.gmu.edu).",

In order to elucidate the spectrum of the viral aetiology of acute respiratory infections and provide basic data to guide local disease prevention and control measures, a sentinel surveillance project on the viral aetiology of acute respiratory infections was initiated and sponsored by the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau in 2011. Adenovirus is one of the most common causes of viral acute respiratory infections. In this study, our primary aim was to identify the types of HAdV causing respiratory illness in Beijing since 2011, to avoid the overuse of antibiotics and to improve the level of diagnosis and treatment of respiratory viral disease especially HAdV associated disease in hospitals, and to provide scientific basis for prevention and control of HAdV causing respiratory illness.",

This genome stability of HAdV-3, 4, and 7 was also reported in earlier studies, showing that HAdV-3 has displayed a relatively stable genome for more than 50 years [24]; the genomes of the HAdV-4 and HAdV-7 strains are also remarkably conserved, albeit only extending for at least 20 years [25]. This characteristic has also been found for other HAdVs such as HAdV-5, whose genome was found to be stable even beyond the 45 years of its circulation in the population [26].

Genomics and bioinformatics data indicate that HAdV-55 (earlier name HAdV-11a) is an emergent respiratory pathogen due to recombination between HAdV-11 and HAdV-14 [13,14]. As a newly identified acute respiratory disease pathogen, HAdV-55-associated outbreaks were reported to have occurred in military camps of Singapore and Turkey in 2005[27], and in a senior high school in the Shaanxi province of China in 2006 [13]. Since 2008, this pathogen has been isolated from cases of respiratory infection and community-acquired pneumonia among adults in Beijing, Hebei, Shandong, Chongqing, and Gansu provinces of China [28\u201330]; it was also isolated among military trainees in Hebei province of China in 2012 [30]. This may raise a serious public health concern, because HAdV-55 has the potential to spread and cause severe epidemics in China, and it may become a major etiological agent causing pneumonia among the Chinese population. In this study, two patients who were affected with HAdV-55 also appeared to have relatively severe symptoms (clinical diagnosis was pneumonia), highlighting the significance of HAdV-55 as being an increasing cause of respiratory illness especially pneumonia. Therefore, efforts should be focused on a HAdV-55 vaccine because of its stable genome. In addition, the genome stability of these HAdVs is also a desired property in the application of these viruses as gene delivery vectors.",

Recombination is a well-known feature in HAdV genetics and is one of the most important factors driving the evolution of HAdVs [31]. In this study, the phylogenetic analysis indicated that strain BJ04 and strain BJ09 may have recombined between HAdV-1 genome (penton base gene) and HAdV-2 genome (hexon and fiber genes) within species HAdV-C, which are intraspecies recombination events. Intraspecies recombinations have already been identified in many emergent HAdV pathogens, which were subsequently identified as novel type HAdVs, such as HAdV-53 to 68 [13,31,32]. In this study, strains BJ04 and BJ09 were identified as intraspecies recombinants, and this recombination pattern (P1H2F2) has not yet been found in elsewhere, which indicated that it may also be a novel HAdV type. Although the two patients affected with this undefined type HAdV appeared to have only mild symptoms (clinical diagnosis was upper respiratory tract infection), the pathogenicity remains unclear and the virus has the potential to cause serious symptoms because of its infection of children below 1-year old. Further studies on the whole genomic sequence and virulence determination including a comparison of the growth kinetics and cytopathology of the recombinant virus and the two parental strains (HAdV-1 and HAdV-2) will be required to elucidate the characteristics of this novel HAdV type.",
