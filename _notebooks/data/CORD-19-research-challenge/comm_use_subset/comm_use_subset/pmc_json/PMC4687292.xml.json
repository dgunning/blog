            "text": "The feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is a retrovirus that occurs worldwide in domestic cats and some related small felids [1, 2]. FeLV infection can induce cytoproliferative (tumors) and cytosuppressive (immunodeficiency, anemia) diseases with fatal outcomes. FeLV isolates are categorized into several subgroups according to their viral receptor usage and interference capabilities. FeLV-A is the common subgroup, which is horizontally transmitted, highly contagious, but low in pathogenicity [1, 3]. FeLV-A infected cats may develop diseases, such as lymphoma mainly of T-cell origin. FeLV-B and FeLV-C arise within FeLV-A infected cats by recombination with endogenous FeLV-like sequences (enFeLV) and via mutations or insertions in the surface glycoprotein gene, respectively [4, 5]. FeLV-B is found in ~50 % of the FeLV-infected cats, whereas FeLV-C develops in only ~1 % of FeLV infections and is strongly associated with the development of non-regenerative anemia [3, 6, 7]. Furthermore, FeLV-T, a T-cell tropic cytopathic virus that causes lymphoid depletion and immunodeficiency, may develop from FeLV-A in infected cats via mutations and insertions in the surface glycoprotein gene [8]. Finally, most recently a FeLV-D subgroup was described; FeLV-D are recombinant viruses that arise after transduction of the envelope gene of feline endogenous gammaretrovirus, ERV-DC, into FeLV [9].",

            "text": "There are a variety of outcomes from FeLV infection, which are not only influenced by the strain, subtype and dose of the virus but also by different host factors, such as the age and immune system status of the infected cat [1]. The spectrum of different infection outcomes is classified according to results from FeLV antigen (p27) and nucleic acid detection and serology into abortive, regressive, progressive or atypical infections [10\u201313]. Detection of the p27 antigen is a parameter for viremia in most cats [14]. In addition, latent non-productive infection, characterized by the absence of viremia and the persistence of the virus in the bone marrow, can be identified in cats following regressive infection [15, 16]. Latent infection is detected by the prolonged cultivation of bone marrow cells in the presence of hydrocortisone [16] and usually resolves within a few months of exposure to FeLV but has been detected in some cats up to 30 months after infection [17]. Although persistently infected cats fail to develop a successful immune response to FeLV and succumb to FeLV-associated diseases, cats with regressive infections (previously also referred to as \u201crecovered cats\u201d) [18] mount a cellular and humoral immune response to FeLV and overcome viremia usually after a few weeks; however, these cats typically remain provirus-positive for the remainder of their lives [19]. The prevalence of provirus positive and p27-negative cats varies among different investigated populations and has been observed to be as high as 10 % [19, 20]. The clinical importance of the provirus positive status is not completely understood but may contribute to a long-lasting maintenance of protective immunity against FeLV [21]. However, reactivation of the infection with development of FeLV-associated diseases has been documented in many provirus positive cats [11, 15, 16, 22, 23].",

The virus is also detectable in feces, urine, milk and blood [24\u201328]. Iatrogenic transmission of FeLV may occur via the transfusion of blood from FeLV viremic (p27 antigen-positive) blood donors [29], and blood recipients may be particularly prone to infection and FeLV-associated disease due to pre-existing grave clinical conditions and possible immunosuppression. Common reasons for blood transfusion in cats include hemorrhages, lack of erythropoiesis and immune-mediated hemolytic anemia [30]. Blood banks for cats have been developed, and the demand for high-quality blood products has increased [30, 31]. The screening of blood donors and products for infectious diseases is of increasing importance. It is commonly recommended to test feline blood donors for FeLV infection by antigen detection [32]. So far, the risk of a FeLV transmission by transfusion of provirus positive blood has not been evaluated. However, intradermal inoculation of plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) carrying the FeLV-A provirus (Rickard/FRA) has resulted in productive FeLV infection [33]. Therefore, we hypothesized that whole blood containing white blood cells carrying the FeLV provirus will transfer the infection and result in full-blown infection in recipient cats. The aim of the present study was thus to test whether FeLV infection can be transmitted via the transfusion of blood from a FeLV provirus positive and antigen negative blood donor to a na\u00efve recipient cat.",

Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and IL-6 were assessed as pro-inflammatory cytokines, whereas IL-10 exhibits anti-inflammatory effects. The most pronounced up-regulation was observed in IFN-\u03b3 levels (Th1) in the cats in group B (up to 155-times increase compared with the pre-transfusion level). The IFN-\u03b3 levels changed significantly over time for each of the three groups (A: pF = 0.0239; B: pF = 0.0053; C: pF < 0.0001), with significantly higher levels in weeks 1 and 15 compared with those in weeks 2, 3 and 11 (Fig. 5b).

A significant difference in IL-5 levels among the three groups was observed in week 1 (pKW = 0.0004), with significantly higher IL-5 levels in group B than in group A (pD < 0.01).

A significant change over time was observed for IL-12 p40 (Th1) in group C (pF = 0.0055), with higher levels in week 11 compared with those in weeks 1 and 15 (pD < 0.05); in week 11, a significant difference was observed among the three groups in IL-12 p40 levels (pKW = 0.0273). For IL-6 (Th2 and pro-inflammatory), a significant change over time was observed for group B (pF = 0.0244) but lost significance in the posttests. Significant changes over time were also observed for IL-4 (Th2) for groups A (pF = 0.0085) and C (pF = 0.0031), with significantly higher IL-4 levels in week 2 compared with week 1 for group A and significantly higher levels in week 11 compared with week 1 for group C (both pD < 0.05; Fig. 5e). Significant differences among the groups were observed in week 1 (pKW = 0.0440) and week 11 (pKW = 0.0391), with significantly lower levels of IL-4 in group A compared with those in group B at both time points (pD < 0.05). No significant differences between the three groups and no significant changes over time were observed in the IL-12 p35 transcription levels (Fig. 5c), and only minor up-regulation was observed for TNF-\u03b1 (up to 2.3-fold; Fig. 5a).",

Blood was collected for the transfusion 42 weeks after the blood donors had been exposed to FeLV and contained a low provirus load. Approximately 104 provirus copies within 10 mL of blood were sufficient to result in a productive FeLV infection in all recipients. Young cats were selected for this experiment because they are more susceptible to FeLV infection than adult cats [36]. Although this increased susceptibility in young cats may be because of immaturity of the immune system, increased susceptibility to FeLV may also be expected in blood transfusion recipients because of severe clinical conditions and/or possible immunosuppression. Moreover, the transfused volume, 10 mL, was adjusted to the body weight of the kittens (~1\u20131.5 kg at the time of the transfusion) to reflect the volume of a regular blood transfusion in adult cats (usually 40\u201360 mL for a cat of ~4 kg body weight). Thus, the chosen experimental setup may well mirror the situation in the field for adult blood transfusion recipients. Some of the recipient cats subsequently developed FeLV-associated disease, confirming our hypothesis that whole blood containing white blood cells carrying FeLV provirus will transfer the virus and result in full-blown infection in recipient cats. Our results confirm and extend previous results in which FeLV infection was transmitted by subcutaneous injection of a plasmid carrying the proviral DNA [33]. Additionally, productive infection after intramuscular or intradermal injection of plasmids carrying proviral DNA were reported for the feline immunodeficiency virus in cats [37, 38] and the simian immunodeficiency virus in macaques [39]. Our study provides direct biological relevance and clinical importance: we conclude that there is an imminent risk of FeLV transmission via blood transfusion of provirus-positive blood, which must be considered in the clinic. By performing the commonly used blood donor screening assay (detecting the p27 antigen), both of the FeLV-infected blood donors that were used in the current study would not have been recognized as a risk. Therefore, we highly recommend screening all feline blood donors and blood products not only for FeLV antigen but also for FeLV provirus using sensitive PCR.",

When the cells containing the provirus entered a new susceptible host via blood transfusion, viral replication reignited. We were unable to determine from our data whether this reigniting was primarily because of the absence of a prepared immune system in the recipient cat or also because of a mixed lymphocyte-type reaction resulting in blastogenesis in the donor lymphocytes and FeLV expression contributing to the fast onset of viral replication. Such a reaction would be expected to occur within hours to a few days after the blood transfusion; no blood samples were collected at these time points, e.g., for lymphocyte isolation, flow cytometry analysis of lymphocyte populations or cytokine measurements. One week after transfusion (the earliest time point analyzed), an increase in total lymphocyte numbers was observed only in some cats in groups A and C; by contrast, all cats in group B exhibited a decrease in lymphocyte counts, which does not support the hypothesis of a mixed lymphocyte reaction. Therefore, if one assumes that FeLV was actively suppressed in the blood donors by the immune system but not in the recipients, the immune mechanism predominantly involved in the control of FeLV replication was not or was insufficiently transferable via blood transfusion. The latter would be true for the cellular immune response; it has been demonstrated previously that the cellular immune response plays an important role in suppressing viral replication in FeLV infections [40].",

The severity of the clinical signs was associated with the severity of the infection: the lymphadenomegaly was particularly pronounced in the two viremic cats in group A, P1 and P2. Natural FeLV infection is characterized by leukopenia, lymphopenia and variable degrees of anemia [1]. A decrease in the WBC and lymphocyte counts was also observed in the present study in the FeLV-exposed cats but not in the control cats. The decrease in WBC and to some degree in lymphocyte counts appeared to be directly associated with the initial FeLV infection and the onset of viral replication; furthermore, the cats that recovered quickly from antigenemia exhibited a fast rebound of WBC counts. In addition, the cats in group A did not exhibit an adequate increase in PCV as observed in the control cats and related to the increasing age of the cats [34].",

In addition, all eight of the recipient cats with regressive infection developed antibodies to FeLV, indicating the presence of at least minimal viral replication in these cats. By contrast, persistently infected cats exhibited lower antibody levels, as has been previously described in natural and experimental FeLV infected cats [19, 41]. Incidentally, no antibodies to gp70 were detectable in any of the cats by western blot. The virus preparation used for the blots were produced on FL-74 cells that harbor FeLV-ABC, but mainly C, for practical reasons (considerably higher yield), whereas the cats of the present study had been exposed to FeLV-A. gp70 but not p27 of FeLV-A and \u2013C exhibited antigenetic differences. Moreover, gp70 may also be denatured during the antigen preparation (boiling in SDS), potentially resulting in loss of the three-dimensional structure and a lack of antibody binding. No samples were available for virus neutralization assays in the present study. Consistent with earlier data [41], only a few cats with regressive infection developed antibodies to p27. It is quite unlikely that these antibodies interfered with the detection of the p27 antigen in these cats; sera containing strong antibody reactivity to FeLV p27 did not interfere with antigen detection supposedly because of the high affinity of the anti-p27 monoclonal antibodies used in the p27 ELISA [42]. Subsequently, five of the ten recipient cats succumbed to FeLV-associated diseases. The cats suffered from non-regenerative anemia, T-cell lymphoma and leukemia, which are commonly regarded as FeLV-associated diseases [1]. Finally, the appearance of non-regenerative anemia was associated with the emergence of FeLV-C. This result also parallels natural FeLV-infection, in which the development of FeLV-C from FeLV-A via mutations has been described for FeLV-infected cats suffering from non-regenerative anemia [3, 43].",

Initially, the cats in group B became provirus-positive significantly earlier after transfusion and developed significantly higher viral RNA and proviral loads than did the cats in group A. However, several weeks after the transfusion, the cats in group A exhibited significantly higher viral RNA, proviral and p27 antigen loads compared with those in group B. Moreover, more cats in group A were p27 antigen-positive compared with those in group B, two cats in group A but none in group B developed persistent infection, and some cats in group B but none in group A became viral RNA-negative within the observation period. A possible explanation for these observations could be the more efficient detection of FeLV by the immune system of cats in group B because of the presence of viral RNA and the higher proviral DNA loads in the transfused blood compared with those in group A. In group A, only low loads of provirus hidden within the donor cells were present. The differences in viral loads were paralleled by variations in the leukogram: a marked decrease in WBC and lymphocyte counts was observed in the cats in group B in week 1 when those cats, but not those of group A, tested viral RNA positive. Moreover, 1 week post transfusion in all cats, but particularly in the cats in group B, high IFN-\u0263 levels with a maximum ~ 150-times increase were observed. IFN-\u03b3 plays a critical role in the innate and adaptive immunity against viral infections, partially through direct inhibitory effects on viral replication but primarily by immune stimulatory and modulatory effects on cellular defense mechanisms [44]. In FeLV-specific immunity, an important role of specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes was demonstrated, and FeLV-specific effector cytotoxic T-cell responses were detected as early as 1 week after virus exposure and were over the course of the early infection particularly high in cats that recovered from viremia [40]. Furthermore, the cats in group B exhibited higher IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10 levels compared with those in group A in week 1 after the transfusion; however, the changes in these cytokines were much less pronounced than in IFN-\u0263. IL-4 is a key regulator of humoral immunity and promotes the differentiation of Th2 cells, whereas IL-5 is produced by Th2 cells and stimulates B cells and antibody secretion. IL-4 and IL-5 levels increased in the cats in group A in week 2. Moderately increased levels of IL-10 were observed in group B around week 2 or 3, whereas in group A, these levels were detected only in weeks 11 and 15. IL-10 has multiple effects but is also associated with B cell proliferation and antibody production. Accordingly, more cats with high anti-FeLV antibody levels were observed in group B than in group A 4\u20136 weeks after virus exposure. Altogether, the data indicate that the immune systems of the cats in group B reacted quicker and more pronounced to the transfused blood and the virus that was transmitted with the blood compared with the cats in group A. This result supports our assumption of more efficient detection of FeLV by the recipients of the blood from blood donor B, in which viral RNA and higher proviral loads were present.",

An association between enFeLV loads and FeLV replication has been reported previously: cats with high enFeLV loads exhibited higher viral replication than cats with low enFeLV loads in the early phase of a persistent FeLV infection [45]. Moreover, low enFeLV loads prior to FeLV exposure may be significantly associated with the development of a progressive infection, whereas cats with high enFeLV loads may rather develop a regressive infection [45, 46]. The cats in the present study originated all from the same SPF cattery, and the recipient cats were assigned into the three groups to avoid familial clustering. Nonetheless, the cats in group A tended to have somewhat lower enFeLV loads than the cats in group B, which would, as outlined above, fit to the lower FeLV replication observed early during infection and the higher number of cats who developed progressive infection in group A compared with group B.",

In addition, in our hands, all of the cats with reactivated infection developed fatal FeLV-associated disease [11, 22, 23]. Thus, to detect provirus carriers, e.g., to further decrease FeLV incidence in a feline population, cats with exposure risk should not only be tested for FeLV antigenemia/viremia but also for FeLV provirus. Plasma viral RNA could also be detected in the recipient cats R1 and P5 prior to reactivation, further supporting our hypothesis that the presence of plasma viral RNA may be associated with a higher probability of reactivation of the FeLV infection [11, 12]. Therefore, the detection of plasma viral RNA in provirus positive aviremic cats may serve as a marker for potential reactivation.",

The results of our study underline the biological and epidemiological relevance of retroviral provirus in FeLV aviremic cats, further supporting observations that the proviral DNA in cats with regressive infection may maintain its replication capacity for many months to years [22, 23]. Sensitive PCR is recommended to detect provirus carriers as demonstrated in the current study to be performed in any cat serving as a blood donor to exclude inadvertent transmission of FeLV to the blood recipients but also in general to further decrease the incidence of FeLV infection within the cat population. The FeLV vaccines that are currently available can be efficacious in preventing persistent infection and the development of diseases subsequent to virus exposure; however, these vaccines do not prevent provirus integration [21]. Ideally, in the future, vaccines will be developed that also prevent provirus integration. Moreover, viral eradication treatments should be developed that eliminate proviral DNA in infected hosts. The latter is also a goal envisioned for HIV in humans [47, 48].",

All of the cats were of blood type A, and the recipient cats were compatible with the donors in the crossmatch. The kittens were anesthetized intramuscularly as described above, and 10 mL of whole blood was collected for baseline analysis and to prevent circulatory volume overload. Thereafter, 10 mL of blood from the respective blood donor was transfused slowly over 30 min to each recipient cat.

In addition, antibodies to FeLV were determined by western blotting using 20 \u03bcg of FeLV per blot purified by sucrose gradient from FL-74 cell culture supernatant as previously described [60]. EDTA-anticoagulated plasma samples were diluted 1:200 and the peroxidase conjugated goat-anti-cat antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., PA) were diluted 1:1000. Primary in-house monoclonal mouse ascites antibodies to gp70, p27, p15E [59, 63] diluted 1:400 and a secondary peroxidase conjugated goat-anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) at a dilution of 1:1000 were used as positive controls. Moreover, pooled EDTA plasma samples from immune and SPF cats were used as positive and negative controls, respectively.",
