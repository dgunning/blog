Codon is an important link in the output of nucleic acid information. Genetic code has degenerate feature that a single amino acid, except methionine (Met) and tryptophan (Trp), is encoded by more than one codon known as synonymous codons. The synonymous codons are not used at equal frequencies in coding sequences in many organisms [1]. This phenomenon called \u2018synonymous codon usage bias (SCUB)\u2019 reflects non-uniform usage of synonymous codons encoding the same amino acid during the translation of genes to proteins [2,3].",

SCUB was affected by many factors, including directional mutation, neutral selection [8], GC content, synonymous substitution rate [9], tRNA abundance [10], selection for efficient translation initiation [11], codon hydropathy and DNA replication initiation site [12], gene length [13] and expression level [14], etc. Of these factors, directional mutation and neutral selection are the two main ones, with varying relative importance in different species [15\u201317]. The codon usage patterns always represent balance between the directional mutation and the neutral selection that leads to translational efficiency of genes [8\u201311]. SCUB patterns were also associated with phylogenetic relationship among given species. Distant phylogenetic species usually has greater variations in codon usage bias [18,19].",

            "text": "Cotton (Gossypium spp.) is the main source of renewable textile fibers and is also grown to produce vegetable oil and high protein meals for humans and livestock [23]. The genus Gossypium includes around 46 diploid (2n = 2x = 26) and 6 tetraploid (2n = 4x = 52) and 1 purported species [24\u201326], including four commercial ones, G. arboreum (A2), G. herbaceum (A1), G. hirsutum (AD1) and G. barbadense (AD2). It has been proposed that all diploid cotton species may have evolved from a common ancestor and allopolyploid cotton may have appeared through hybridization and subsequent polyploidization events between the A- and D-subgenome progenitors. The D-genome species G. raimondii (D5) and the A-genome species much like modern G. arboreum (A2) and G. herbaceum (A2) are the donor species for the D and A chromosome groups of the tetraploid cotton species, respectively [27\u201328]. Recently, the nuclear genome sequences of G. arboreum, G. raimondii, G. hirsutum and G. barbadense, and chloroplast and mitochondrial genome sequences of G. hirsutum have successively been released [29\u201338], which has advanced the understanding of cotton genomics and genetics, and made it possible to investigate SCUB patterns in cotton nuclear and organelle genomes. But until now, SCUB analysis has been performed only in chloroplast genome of G. hirsutum [36]. The purpose of this study was to analyze the SCUB patterns of the four sequenced cotton species and explore the key factors influencing codon choice.",

When there is no deviation between mutation and selection pressure of two DNA chains, the fractional content of the four bases follows A = T and G = C (where A + T + G + C = 1) [40]. PR2-bias plots are particularly informative when PR2 biases at the third codon position are plotted. The center of the plot, where both coordinates are 0.5, is the place where A = T and G = C (PR2). The degree of deviation from PR2 allows us to estimate the chain bias affected by mutation, selection, or both [41]. If genes are evenly distributed across the plan view, that is, if the codon usage frequency of A + T is the same as that of G + C at the third position, then the codon usage preference is likely to be entirely caused by mutation [40]. The A3s/(A3s+T3s) and G3s/(G3s+C3s) of each gene were calculated and used as the ordinate and the abscissa to show the relationship between the two base contents of genes, namely purine (A and G) and pyrimidine (T and C) at the third codon position.

Generally speaking, highly expressed genes have a large degree of codon preference and therefore a small ENC value. Low expression genes contain more rare codons and have a larger ENC value. Therefore, the relative level of gene expression is currently generally determined by comparing ENCs. The smaller the ENC value is, the higher the corresponding gene is often expressed. 5% of the sequence data were taken from the upper and lower limit regions of the ordered data set, to establish two high- and low-bias gene datasets. To define optimal codons, we used a T-test to examine the significance of codon usage difference between the two datasets [47]. The RSCU values of the codons from the two databases were compared. If the difference (\u0394RSCU) is equal to or greater than 0.08, and codons with a frequency of usage that was significantly higher (P < 0.01) in high-bias genes than that in genes with low bias were defined as the optimal codons [22,48].

Briefly, the base composition at the third codon position conforms to T > A > G > C. Both the GC3s and GC content were less than 0.5, illustrating that these four cotton species tend to use pyrimidine-rich codons more frequently than purine-rich codons. In G. raimondii, the T3s was even greater than GC content. The average GC contents are higher than GC3S. Such codon base composition preference was also previously reported in upland cotton chloroplast genes whose GC3s (27.38%) and GC (37.89%) were even lower [36].

These correlation results indicated that the base content at the third position of the synonymous codons directly affects the degree of codon usage preference. It could be concluded that genes with stronger codon usage bias (with lower ENC value) would have lower G3s, C3s and higher T3s values.

However, along the abscissa, there were two types of distributions. A slightly more number of genes of G. arboreum, G. barbadense and its two subgenomes distributed on the G > C side than the G < C side while nearly equal amount of genes of G. raimondii, G. hirsutum and its two subgenomes distributed on both sides. These results revealed a codon usage imbalance between A + T and G + C at the third base position and indicated that not only the mutation, but also the selection and other factors determined the codon usage patterns in these four cotton species and four subgenomes, and the degree of the third codon position preferences in G. arboreum and G. barbadense are slightly different from G. raimondii and G. hirsutum.

Similar ENC-plots are found among all the four cotton species genomes and the four subgenomes of the two tetraploid species (Fig 4). CDSs appeared to cluster around the expected ENC of 30\u201360. Although a small number of genes distributed in the vicinity of the expected curve, indicated that compositional constraint was the only determinant factor shaping the codon usage pattern. A majority of genes with low ENC values deviated well below the expected curve, indicating that GC3s value was a major determinant of codon usage bias and that other factors independent of nucleotide composition shaped codon usage as well [65].

They found that nucleotides at degenerate positions consistently produced moderate-strength codon-anticodon binding energy. If the first two bases of a codon are both A or U, the C at the third position will give a closer to average codon binding energy than U. Similarly, if the first two bases are either C or G, the third base of \"right choice\" is U because C gives a strong binding energy. Therefore, we can characterize the translational efficiency of a gene by the frequency of \"correct selection\", called P2 index, between the pyrimidines in codons starting with AA, AU, UA, UU, CC, CG, GC or GG.",

From Table 6, it was seen that both SSU and WWU were higher than SSC and WWC in all species and subgenomes, especially in G. raimondii with the largest SSU and WWU and the lowest SSC and WWC. That is, the choice between two pyrimidines (U and C) in the third position of codon tends to U. Then the P2 index of species and subgenomes was calculated (Table 6). All species and subgenomes had P2 values more than 0.5, which revealed that translational selection played the dominant role over mutation pressure in the codons\u2019 usage.",

The two Dt subgenomes and the D5 genome (G. raimondii) were grouped into different clusters, so as to the two At subgenomes and the A2 genome (G. arboreum). These results are quite inconsistent with the widely accepted taxonomic and phylogenetic relationship of these four cotton species [24,26,28,67\u201370]. The allopolyploid cotton species may have appeared through hybridization and subsequent polyploidization events between the A- and D-subgenome progenitors. The D-genome species G. raimondii (D5) and the A-genome species much like modern G. arboreum (A2) and G. herbaceum (A1) have been supported by molecular methods and other evidence [28,68,71\u201372] to be the donor species for the Dt and At subgenome of the tetraploid cotton species, respectively. The monophyly of polyploid Gossypium species was also studied through cluster analysis based on sequences of a 2.8-kb intergenic region from all diploid species belonging to the genome groups from which the polyploid originates [28], in which all the Dt subgenomes and D5 genome were grouped into one cluster, and all the At subgenomes and the A1 and A2 genomes were grouped into another cluster. The results of the present study indicated that the evolutionary relationship among these four cotton species could not be well reflected by RSCU-based cluster analysis.",

All these genomes and subgenomes exhibited similar weaker codon usage bias revealed by the results of less (< 0.5%) genes with low (< 35) ENC and more genes (> 70%) with high ENC. Codon composition analysis revealed these species and subgenomes had low GC and GC3, tended to use pyrimidine-rich codons more frequently than purine-rich codons at the third positions of codons and follow the T > A > G > C trend, although there was significant difference in codon composition and codon usage preference among them. Correlation analysis indicated that the base content at the third position of codons affected the degree of codon preference. PR2-bias plot and ENC-plot revealed that not only translation selection but also directional mutation and other factors shaped the CUB. The P2 analysis results, with the non-significant correlation between GC12 and GC3, further revealed that translation selection was the main factor influencing the CUB pattern herein. Through RSCU analysis, 25 high frequency codons preferentially ended with T or A, and 31 low frequency codons preferentially ended with C or G common in these genomes and subgenomes were determined. And 19 to 26 optimal codons were determined, including 19 common ones, for each species and subgenome. The optimal codons preferred to end with A or T. Finally, we concluded that these four cotton genomes had weak CUB, translation selection played dominant role over mutation pressure in codon usage preference in these four cotton species, and At and Dt subgenomes had similar codon usage patterns with their A- and D-genome progenitors.",
