There are several key components for an assembly algorithm, including the capacity to handle massive data sets, the accuracy and efficiency of the assembly, the nature of the data set itself, and the intended use of the assembly results. The former two are dependent of the hardware and algorithms implemented, whereas the latter two influences the optimization strategy and the type of information to be extracted during assembly. For example, metagenomic studies commonly aim to understand the composition and relative abundances of the data set as well as the intra-species or inter-population heterogeneity, therefore the assembly depth and length as well as accuracy are prioritized for such data sets [2].",

Two main NGS platforms, 454/Roche pyrosequencing [6] and Illumina Genome Analyzer [7], have been commonly used for recent quasispecies-related studies. Pyrosequencing has longer sequence reads and typically does not require data set assembly [8\u201310], although some studies still performed de novo assembly [11] or reference sequence assembly [12, 13]. Illumina sequencing generates much larger data sets compared to pyrosequencing, but its shorter read length limits the efficiency for de novo assembly [2]. Therefore, Illumina sequenced viral quasispecies data sets are usually assembled using reference sequences as templates [14\u201317] while de novo assembly is applicable but not commonly used [18].",

However, a major challenge for Illumina quasispecies NGS studies is the sequence assembly of the data sets. Sequence assembly using a reference approach is not only subject to bias of the chosen reference sequence, but also assembles less reads and thus less genetic variation information in the assembly [15]. De novo assembly should be able to provide the most complete and accurate genetic information of NGS data, but can be hindered by regions with high levels of diversity. The commonly used de novo assembly algorithms, such as Velvet [19], SOAPdenovo [20], CLC Genomics Workbench (CLC, CLC bio, Aarhus, Denmark), and Euler-SR [21], were not originally intended for the assembly of metagenomics data with high diversity and coverage depth. Recent progress have been made in the development of de novo assembly algorithms for metagenomes, such as MetaVelvet [22] and Genovo [23].",

PDR generates an in situ reference sequence by de novo assembly of a smaller yet less diverse partial data set followed by the reference assembly of the full data set. Results show that the PDR assembly results are more complete and accurate than direct de novo or reference assembly of highly polymorphic metagenomic data sets. We also present a novel BLAST-based assembly pipeline, BBAP, capable of both de novo and reference assembly specifically designed for assembly of metagenomic data sets. The assembly efficiency and accuracy of both PDR and BBAP were examined using actual NGS data sets as well as in silico generated simulated NGS data sets and compared with the assembly results of other assembly methods.",

For de novo assembly of partial data sets (PD) of each data set, five partial data sets were initially randomly generated and assembled independently. Because the PD assembly results of the partial data sets from each library were highly similar (data not shown), a single partial data set and its assembly results were used for representation of the sample in further analyses. The PD assembly yielded fewer number of contigs and longer average maximum contig lengths, indicating the PD assembly results were not as fragmentized as FD assembly. Furthermore, PD assembly required fewer contigs than the FD assembly to span the full genome to recover the full length HBV genome (Fig. 1a, Additional file 2: Figure S1). PD assembly also yielded a higher proportion of mapped HRURs (95.9% vs 70.3%) and RiHRURs (reads included in high redundancy unique representative reads, 80.4% vs. 68.7%) than FD, further demonstrating its better assembly efficiency.\n",

A similar trend was also found in D2_1 PD assembly (Additional file 1: Table S4). The shorter FD assembled contigs (<300 bp) had a significantly higher proportion of polymorphic sites than the longer FD assembled contigs (Additional file 2: Figure S2, Student\u2019s t-test, p < 0.05).

Additionally, the redundancies of the included HRURs in the full and partial data sets were highly correlated (R2 = 0.9997).

Overall, results of SR assembly and PDR assembly were similar in recovering sequence variation, but the latter included more HRURs and RiHRURs with increased accuracy due to the additional mapping options of the shorter HBV variant contigs provided by the de novo assembly of the partial data set, whereas the lower assembly accuracy of the former resulted in low quality alignments and slightly more polymorphic sites.",

Current assembly approaches typically assemble the full data set straightforward with either de novo or reference assembly methods, each with their respective advantages and disadvantages. Reference assembly is a much more direct process than de novo assembly which reduces alignment ambiguities and low coverage issues. However, the quality of reference assembly is reliant on the representation level of the reference sequence, as the assembly result will be biased towards the reference sequence and sequence variations not represented by the reference sequence will not be captured. De novo assembly, which is independent of reference sequences, possesses the potential to generate a more complete assembly result including majority consensus sequences and minor variant sequences, but can be hindered by coverage gaps that lack sequencing information and polymorphic regions with high levels of diversity as shown in Tables 1 and 2.",

De Bruijn graphs contain overlapping sequence information represented by branching nodes and stemming vertices, and is extremely sensitive and results quickly deteriorate even with the slightest amount of polymorphism [21]. The assembly algorithm of Velvet and SOAPdenovo both manipulate the constructed de Bruijn graph with error removal and simplification to generate optimal assembly results, which effectively excludes the essential polymorphism information vital to metagenomics data sets during assembly. In contrast, MetaVelvet decomposes the de Bruijn graphs into individual subgraphs and assembles each subgraphs into separate contigs. On the other hand, BBAP adopts a greedy assembly approach by incorporating and clustering sequence reads through BLAST results, and Genovo implements a Bayesian-based probabilistic model and takes into account the potential presence of multiple genomes in the data set. Therefore, it was reasonably expected for BBAP, MetaVelvet, and Genovo to have better assembly results than Velvet and SOAPdenovo when assembling metagenomics data sets, and this was consistent with our results that support BBAP, MetaVelvet, and Genovo are better equipped to assemble metagenomics data sets than Velvet or SOAPdenovo.",

The grouped reads are then extended into contigs according to positioning/alignment information provided from the BLAST results in a greedy strategy manner.

Data set sizes were set to 1,726,462 (55,799X), 172,646 (5,579X), 17,264 (557X), and 1726 (55X) HQRs. Five independent data sets were generated for each parameter combination, error rate and dataset size. Data sets were assembled using BBAP FD assembly, Velvet, MetaVelvet, SOAPdenovo, and Genovo. All in silico data sets, except for data sets of high error rate (0.01) coupled with small data set sizes (55X and 557X), used the same BBAP parameter values for NGS de novo assembly. For the high error rate-low coverage depth data sets, the redundancy threshold was reduced from 5 to 1 to compensate for its low redundancy. For Velvet, MetaVelvet, and SOAPdenovo assembly, the k-mer size was optimally set to 57, 57, and 63, respectively. For Genovo assembly, different numbers of iterations were used for data sets of different coverage depths because of the extreme long run time for larger data sets; the number of iterations for data sets with coverage depths of 55,799X, 5,579X, 557X and 55X was 10, 2000, 10,000, and 10,000, respectively.",
