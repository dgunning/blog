PCD is characterized by abnormal ciliary motility usually related to an ultrastructural defect. Ciliary dysfunction, affecting mucociliary clearance, leads to chronic airway infections characterized by bronchiectasis and chronic sinusitis, sometimes associated with situs inversus (Kartagener syndrome) and male infertility \n[2]. Although airway symptoms usually begin in early childhood, the diagnosis is sometimes delayed for several years \n[1,3-5]. However, it is of prime importance to recognize this disease early in order to start appropriate therapy of respiratory tract infections and minimize lung damage.",

Nasal nitric oxide (NOn), known to be dramatically reduced (10-15% of normal) in most patients with confirmed PCD, has been proposed to improve diagnostic procedures \n[8-11]. However, NOn is sometimes difficult to measure, especially in young children, and low NOn values have been reported in other disorders with overlapping clinical features such as cystic fibrosis \n[10-12].",

However, in our clinical practice, although description of beat pattern is easy in typical cases as immotile cilia, it becomes highly subjective when ciliary beating is totally or partially maintained. Consequently, our assumption was that quantitative analysis of ciliary beating would improve identification of ciliary beat pattern abnormalities.",

Briefly, in each of the 20 areas, an epithelial edge with a majority of cilia beating was scored 1; an edge with half of cilia beating was scored 0.5 and an edge with a minority of cilia beating was scored 0. The percentage of beating ciliated edges was defined as the sum of the scores divided by 20. Ten cilia able to be followed during a complete beating cycle (excluding cilia whose tip ran out of the focal plane) were then selected in distinct edges. Video sequences were played back frame by frame in order to determine three points characterizing the complete cycle of each cilium. These three points correspond to the position of the base of the cilium (P0) and the positions of the tip before the active and recovery strokes (P1 and P2, respectively) (see Figure \n1). Five time-points were defined at the tip of the cilium corresponding to the steps of one beating cycle: start and arrival of the active stroke (t1 and t2, respectively), start and arrival of the recovery stroke (t3 and t4, respectively) and start of the following beating cycle (t5). These various measurements were used to determine 12 parameters. Global frequency, power stroke duration and recovery duration, the pauses after the active and recovery strokes, total pause, cilia length and beating angle were calculated. The distance travelled by the cilium per second (i.e., the length of the path travelled by the tip in one second) and the area swept per second (i.e., the area swept by the cilium in one second) were also calculated. These two last parameters were then weighted by the percentage of beating ciliated edges. The formula used to calculate these different parameters is shown in the legend to Figure \n1.",

Firstly, all of the proposed quantitative parameters were able to be determined in all patients, meaning that beating cilia were always detected, even in the absence of dynein arms. In our experience, the average duration of a complete assessment (including video recording and analysis) is about one hour per patient, allowing this technique to be applied in clinical practice. The mean ciliary beat frequency measured in this study was significantly lower in PCD patients than in non-PCD patients with chronic airway infections, as reported with conventional techniques \n[3,10,14,26]. The beating angle can be considered to be a parameter evaluating the amplitude of the ciliary beat. Due to the flexible nature of ciliary beat, beating angle remains of course only an indicator of amplitude. In the future, the measurement of the bending angle of the cilia, especially during the power stroke, might be an interesting parameter. However, this measurement will require to increase the amount of measured points on the video of the beating cilia and to develop new algorithms of calculation. All quantitative parameters were significantly different between PCD and non-PCD groups. Weighted distance travelled per second could be useful for PCD diagnosis, as this parameter appeared to be the most discriminative with no overlapping results between PCD and non-PCD groups.",

In the patients with a conclusive gold standard diagnosis, the two methods were always concordant when the ciliary dyskinesia score \u2265 2 or \u2264 0.15, (14 patients, see Table \n2 and Figure \n5), i.e. when ciliary beat pattern was virtually immotile or normal, respectively. In the cases of ciliary dyskinesia score < 2 and or > 0.15 (11 patients see Table \n2 and Figure \n5), i.e. when a moderate alteration of ciliary beat pattern was exhibited, three situations were observed: in 2/11 patients (# 4 and 5), the two methods were discordant and the PCD diagnosis was in accordance with the quantitative analysis; in 8/11 patients (# 12, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 23) the quantitative analysis concluded to the non-PCD diagnosis with a \u2265 98% sensitivity and the qualitative evaluation showed a low dyskinesia score (between 0.25 and 0.5); in 1/11 patient (# 7) with a conclusive PCD diagnosis, qualitative evaluation showed a low dyskinesia score (0.25) while the quantitative parameters were just below the threshold of 96% sensitivity and 95% specificity. It is difficult to pinpoint the reasons of the discrepancies observed between quantitative and qualitative methods, as the two methods are based on the same concept, i.e., describing a movement from the same high speed video recording. We can speculate that qualitative evaluation does not always allow easy assessment of beat pattern. Scoring ciliary dyskinesia from 1 to 3 depending on the extent of abnormal beating along the edge, as proposed by Chilvers et al. \n[20], is clearly more subjective than a physical measurement in a continuous space. Our results suggest that the proposed quantitative analysis is more precise and more sensitive than qualitative evaluation. This gain of precision is especially useful when cilia are still beating but with moderate alterations (more than 40% of patients referred for suspicion of PCD in our center).",

Such a result demonstrates the need to have a new method allowing to better defining PCD. The proposed method is a trial to get a better classification of PCD, based on the dyskinectic pattern. In the inconclusive group, the proposed parameters can be helpful to assess the diagnosis of PCD while the measurement of ciliary beat frequency alone is not helpful. The weighted distance travelled per second is the most discriminating parameter for this purpose. Use of this type of procedure could reclassify two patients as possibly excluded PCD (patients # 26 and 33) and four patients as possibly confirmed PCD (patients # 27, 28, 30 and 34). Very interestingly, for one of these patients (#34), the diagnosis of PCD was confirmed by genetic analysis showing RSPH9 mutations (data not shown). Nevertheless, three patients remained inconclusive for PCD status (patients # 29, 31, 32; see grey symbols in Figure \n4). Molecular genetics studies would greatly improve diagnostic efficiency, but gene mutations have been reported in fewer than 50% of PCD patients to date \n[3,22].",

However, quantitative analysis provides more precise and more sensitive results in the presence of moderate alterations (observed in almost one half of patients in this series). Therefore, it could be very useful in PCD patients representing a challenge for diagnosis, as those with Kartagener syndrome and no ultrastructural defect (patient # 27) \n[7] and those with central complex defect and low percentage of abnormal cilia combined with residual beating cilia (patient # 34) \n[16,27,28]. Quantitative analysis of beat pattern can also be proposed to select patients eligible for TEM by using a cutoff for weighted distance travelled per second ensuring 100% sensitivity (even with a specificity of 55%). This type of selection would decrease by almost one third the indications for TEM analysis in patients with suspected PCD.",
