The precursor polyprotein is processed co- and post-translationally by cellular and viral proteases into 10 proteins: structural proteins (core, E1, and E2), a small membrane-associated protein p7, and six nonstructural (NS) proteins NS2, 3, 4A, 4B, 5A, and 5B [3].",

Only a few percentage of the infected individuals are able to clear and resolve the infection, the remaining majority (50\u201380%) develop chronic hepatitis and other liver complications [2]. The viral mechanisms of chronic infection and the cellular determinants of infection clearance are poorly understood. Many viruses including HCV have developed sophisticated mechanisms to evade or antagonize cellular anti-viral responses, leading to persistent and/or chronic infection. The Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway is one of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades and plays important roles in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, survival, and transmission of oncogenic signals [4]. This pathway is activated by a variety of stimuli including growth factors, mitogens, transforming agents, and virus infections. Upon stimulation, activated Raf kinase activates MEK1/2, which in turn activates ERK1/2 to phosphorylate substrates in the cytoplasm or to translocate to the nucleus to phosphorylate transcription factors and regulate target gene expression. MAPK also phosphorylates and activates other kinases termed MAPK-activated protein kinases including the 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinases, the mitogen-and stress-activated kinases, and the MAPK-interacting kinases [5].",

            "text": "Viruses are intracellular obligate parasites; they have evolved to exploit the host cellular machinery for their replication. The MEK/ERK signaling pathway plays an important role in their replication. Activation of the MEK/ERK signaling cascade enhances replication of viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus [6], influenza virus [7], borna disease virus [8], coronavirus [9], coxsakievirus B3 [10], and herpes simples virus [11]. The underlying molecular mechanisms include interference with viral translational and replication machineries as well as host anti-viral defense. On the other hand, activation of the MEK/ERK signaling leads to inhibitory effects of virus replication as in the case of hepatitis B virus, a hepatotropic virus which like HCV induces hepatocellular carcinoma in infected hosts [12]. Meanwhile, interleukin-1 (IL-1) inhibits HCV replication in HCV subgenomic replicon cells through activation of ERK and induction of interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene 1-8U; MEK inhibitor PD98059 abrogates the inhibitory effects of IL-1 on HCV replication [13]. IL-1 is also involved in IFN-\u03b1-mediated antiviral gene induction in human hepatoma cells [14]. Taken together, these findings indicate that IL-1-mediated ERK activation induces an anti-viral effect. As the nature of the stimuli determines the final outcome of the signaling, it is conceivable that other stimuli of ERK signaling may have different effects on HCV replication. Moreover, it is not known whether and how the MEK/ERK signaling affects HCV replication. Therefore, in this study we aimed to characterize the role of this signaling pathway in HCV replication and production using both HCV subgenomic replicon and full-length genomic systems.",

U0126 inhibits the active and inactive forms of MEK1/2, while PD98059 inhibits the activation of inactive MEK1/2 [20], . In the preliminary experiments, we titrated the concentrations of U0126 and PD98059 for a maximal MEK/ERK inhibitory effect while with little cytotoxicity and confirmed the optimal concentrations for U0126 and PD98059 to be 5 \u00b5M and 10 \u00b5M, respectively for their combined use (data not shown). We then used these concentrations to examine the effects of these inhibitors on HCV replication in HCV RLuc replicon cells. Compared to the DMSO control, treatment of MEK inhibitors resulted in a significant increase in the luciferase reporter gene activity (Fig. 1A). We next determined whether these inhibitors affected HCV RNA synthesis. To distinguish between plus- and minus-strand HCV RNA syntheses, we performed the RNase protection assay using the strand-specific probes. Before using this assay, we tested the strand specificity on in vitro transcribed HCV 5\u2032 UTR RNA of plus- and minus-polarities by hybridization with the anti-sense and sense probes, we found that the sense probe only detected the minus-strand RNA and the anti-sense probe only detected the plus-strand RNA and that there was no cross by hybridization (data not shown). Treatment of the inhibitors increased plus-strand HCV RNA level by about 3.5 fold over the DMSO control (Fig. 1B) and had only a slight increase of minus-strand HCV RNA level over the DMSO control (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these results provide the first evidence that inhibition of the MEK/ERK signaling enhanced HCV gene expression and replication.",

            "text": "HCV replication is inhibited by IFN-\u03b1 treatment [22]. IFN-\u03b1 binds to its cognate receptors and activates the JAK/STAT signaling, which in turn induces effectors such as MxA guanosine triphosphatase, dsRNA activated-protein kinase, and 2\u2032-5\u2032oligoadenylate synthase and accounts for IFN-\u03b1-mediated anti-viral activity [23]. To investigate whether MEK inhibitors enhanced HCV replication by antagonizing the well-characterized anti-viral mechanism of IFN-\u03b1, we treated HCV RLuc replicon cells first with IFN-\u03b1/2b, followed by MEK inhibitors. Lysates were prepared for the luciferase reporter assay. As expected, IFN-\u03b1/2b treatment alone inhibited the luciferase reporter gene activity (p = 0.006). Treatment with IFN-\u03b1/2b followed by MEK inhibitors showed a significantly higher luciferase activity compared to IFN-\u03b1 treatment control alone (p = 0.007), but it was significantly lower than the MEK inhibitors alone (p = 0.010) (Fig. 2A). We also determined HCV RNA replication in these cells. We treated the cells as above, isolated total RNA, and performed RPA to detect plus-strand HCV RNA. In agreement with the luciferase reporter gene activity, IFN-\u03b1/2b inhibited plus-strand HCV RNA synthesis (lane 3, Fig. 2B) when compared to its PBS control (lane 2, Fig. 2B); IFN-\u03b1/2b followed by each or both MEK inhibitors increased plus-strand HCV RNA synthesis (lane5, 6 & 7, Fig. 2B) when compared to the IFN-\u03b1/2b plus DMSO control (lane 4, Fig. 2B). In addition, the effect of both inhibitors on plus-strand HCV RNA synthesis was higher than each inhibitor alone (Fig. 2B). These findings suggest that enhanced HCV replication by MEK inhibitors is probably independent of the IFN-\u03b1 anti-viral activity.",

Thus, we then determined whether the basal level of the MEK/ERK activity was sufficient for the MEK inhibitors-enhanced HCV replication. To address this issue, we cultured HCV RLuc replicon cells in the serum-free medium for 24 hr and then treated with MEK inhibitors. Lysates were prepared for the luciferase reporter activity assay, and total RNA was isolated for plus-strand HCV RNA detection by RPA. In the absence of serum in the culture medium, MEK inhibitors also significantly increased the luciferase reporter gene activity when compared to the DMSO control (p = 0.006) (Fig. 3A). In parallel, MEK inhibitors also increased the plus-strand HCV RNA level (Fig. 3B). However, it is very interesting to note that the overall luciferase activity of the cells cultured in the 10%-FBS-containing medium was considerably higher than that of the cells cultured in serum-free medium, despite that the enhancement effects by these inhibitors showed little difference between cells cultured in the presence of serum and in the absence of serum (Fig. 3A). This can be attributed to activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, which is the other major signaling pathway involved in serum-dependent cell survival and growth. Taken together, these results suggest that prior activation of MEK/ERK signaling is not necessary for MEK inhibitors-enhanced HCV replication, but it is involved in regulation of HCV replication.",

HCV RLuc replicon cells were transfected with dominant negative MEK-1, ERK-1, ERK-2 constructs [17] or an empty vector control.

However, expression of dominant negative ERK-1 had little effect on the luciferase gene activity compared to the control (p = 0.445) (Fig. 4B).

We transfected Huh 7.5 cells with in vitro transcribed full-length JFH-1 RNA and then treated the cells with MEK inhibitors or the control DMSO. Western blot analysis of cell lysates showed that treatment of MEK inhibitors resulted in higher HCV core protein expression compared to the DMSO control (Fig. 6A).

To do this, we collected supernatants from JFH-1 RNA-transfected Huh7.5 cells that were treated with MEK inhibitors or DMSO control, isolated the RNA from the supernatants and quantified HCV RNA in the supernatants by real-time RT-PCR. In agreement with the intracellular increases in HCV protein and RNA syntheses, treatment of MEK inhibitors led to a significantly higher level of extracellular HCV production compared to the DMSO control (p = 0.009) (Fig. 6C).

We found that blockage of MEK/ERK signaling by MEK inhibitors increased HCV gene expression and plus-strand RNA synthesis, which is consistent with previous studies [13], [15], . In this study, we further looked at the effects of these inhibitors on HCV minus-strand RNA synthesis and found only a slight increase. This finding could be well explained by the well-known asymmetric nature of plus- and minus-strands HCV RNA synthesis in HCV-infected cells. HCV RNA replication starts with the synthesis of genome-length negative strand RNA which in turn serves as template for multiple rounds of nascent, positive-strand RNA synthesis, leading to an asymmetric accumulation of nearly 10 plus-strand RNA for every single minus-strand RNA [25]. These results imply that the MEK/ERK signaling pathway plays an important role in HCV replication. We further examined and ruled out the possibility that these inhibitors act off-target to produce the observed effects by the findings that dominant negative MEK-1 expression significantly enhanced HCV replication.",

In the case of viral proteins, for example, phosphorylation of NS5A and NS5B proteins has been shown to regulate HCV replication [28], [29]. Moreover, selective inhibition of cellular kinases has found an inverse correlation between NS5A phosphorylation level and HCV RNA replication [29]. In addition, NS5A protein is phosphophorylated on serine and threonine residues [30], [31] making it a potential substrate for MEK kinase. While one study has shown little change in the level of NS5A phosphorylation after treatment with the MEK kinase inhibitor PD98059 [24], the other one has demonstrated an inverse correlation between inhibition of MEK kinase, the level of NS5A phosphorylation and HCV replication [15]. However, our findings that dominant negative ERK-2 expression enhanced HCV replication clearly suggest that the effectors of MEK kinase-mediated control of HCV replication are located downstream of MEK kinase. Therefore, future investigation of the direct phosphorylation of NS5A by MEK would help determine whether the viral NS5A is a direct substrate for this cellular kinase.",

This led us to evaluate the outcome of MEK inhibitors-enhanced HCV replication on virus production using the recently described HCV JFH-1 cell culture system [16]. We found a positive correlation among the increase in HCV proteins, plus-strand RNA accumulation in the cells, and HCV production in the culture supernatant. These findings support the notion that targeting MEK/ERK signaling as therapeutic intervention to treat hepatocellular carcinoma may lead to acceleration of HCV pathogenic process.
