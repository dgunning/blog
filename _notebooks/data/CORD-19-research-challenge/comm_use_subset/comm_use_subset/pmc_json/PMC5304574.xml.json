The World Health Organization (WHO) established a global surveillance network for disease caused by influenza viruses in 1952.1 Since then, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in collaboration with a network of PHLs has formed a US national influenza surveillance system comprising 85 PHLs performing molecular assays from the CDC to type and subtype the influenza virus, and 60 hospital laboratories reporting influenza test data.2 The consequent network and data monitoring systems have facilitated the detection of numerous important events and viral changes, including the rapid identification in 2009 of the pandemic influenza strain (A/H1pdm09). In 2010, to address concurrent fiscal constraints and emerging diseases, the CDC and the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) initiated the Influenza Virologic Surveillance Right Size Project to assess the vast and complex national surveillance system, determine the most efficient means to monitor influenza activity, and establish a standard reference for the CDC and state PHLs.2 The Influenza Virologic Surveillance Right Size Roadmap (1st Edition released in 2013) attempted to guide surveillance toward a more systematic and statistically relevant process. The roadmap includes sample size calculators, developed to estimate the appropriate numbers of samples needed to achieve influenza surveillance with statistical confidence for situational awareness and rare/novel influenza event detection. The roadmap proposed identification of alternate, non\u2010PHL, data sources as a means to augment state PHL data and, in turn, enhance national surveillance.",

New York State Department of Health staff review the submitted data to determine whether it meets the case definition for laboratory\u2010confirmed influenza, defined as a positive influenza laboratory test result with at least one of the following methods: culture, enzyme immunoassay (EIA), direct immunofluorescence assay (DFA), immunofluorescence assay (IFA), RT\u2010PCR, immunohistochemistry (IHC), or influenza virus antigen detection systems (IVADs, also known as rapid influenza diagnostic tests, RIDTs). If the case definition is met, an influenza case report is created in the Communicable Disease Electronic Surveillance System (CDESS). The system automatically deletes duplicate CDESS case reports on the same patient. If the Wadsworth Center tests and does not confirm an initial positive influenza result from another laboratory, the initial test is considered a false\u2010positive result and the original influenza case report is revoked.

The total number of Flu+ specimens tested at the Wadsworth Center was insufficient to detect a rare/novel event for influenza surveillance at the recommended confidence levels. To augment detection of a rare/novel influenza virus, NYS regional PHL influenza rtRT\u2010PCR data supplemented the Wadsworth Center rtRT\u2010PCR data (Figure 5). From the last week of December 2013 through January 2014 with peak influenza activity, Flu+ data provided 86% to 94% confidence in the likelihood of detecting a novel virus present at 1/700 of cases. During low season, the recommended threshold for detection of a novel virus outside of peak season is 1/200 with a minimum Flu+ sample size of 37; sample sizes with 95% confidence were obtained for 4 of those 6 weeks (Table 2). During off\u2010season, the recommended threshold drops to \u00bc with a minimum Flu+ sample size of 1. In fact, just 1 Flu+ sample is needed every 5 weeks per state, as 11 Flu+ samples are needed per week for 52 states nationally (personal communication, Lynette Brammer, CDC). Sample sizes with 95% confidence were obtained for 40 of 40 off\u2010season weeks when counting 1 Flu+ every 5 weeks.

This data included test results from the random submission of specimens from hospitalized cases as well as those from primary care patients. To augment the total surveillance information, other data sources from clinical and commercial laboratories were investigated. The WHO/NREVSS\u2010collaborating laboratories, geographically spread throughout NYS, generate considerable data for situational awareness and directly transmit these data to the CDC, as well as NYS. All WHO/NREVSS laboratories post negative as well as positive results, providing sufficiently robust data for estimates of influenza prevalence. Beyond the WHO/NREVSS\u2010collaborating laboratories, the remainder of the clinical laboratories that report to ECLRS do not report to CDC, nor are their data shared with CDC by the NYSDOH. These ECLRS/CDESS data consist of only influenza\u2010positive cases, and sufficient numbers are not attained for situational awareness in the off\u2010season months. The CDESS Flu+ cases for NYS surveillance comprise a large alternate data source that is not currently transmitted to the CDC and provides an indicator of prevailing influenza strains.",

Therefore, only the CDC assays are likely to reveal an emerging novel virus. Wadsworth and the regional NYS PHL data combined met the Flu+ sample sizes needed to detect a novel virus at a 1/700 threshold with minimal (\u226585%) confidence, for the five peak weeks of influenza activity. Desired sample sizes, thresholds, and optimal (\u226595%) confidence levels were obtained for the majority of low season (1/200 threshold) and all of off\u2010season (\u00bc threshold). To increase off\u2010season influenza testing, NYSDOH issues an annual notice to NYS clinical laboratories, requesting submission of all clinical samples positive for influenza by any detection method during the summer to the Wadsworth Virology Laboratory for testing with CDC influenza rtRT\u2010PCR assay.",

In a comparison of 11 898 respiratory samples tested by the CDC influenza rtRT\u2010PCR assay and the Luminex xTAG RVP, influenza A positive samples with low viral load were often not detected by the RVP and were mostly detected only by the CDC rtRT\u2010PCR.13 Relying on RVP data alone could therefore introduce inaccurate positivity rates. Although sensitivity and specificities vary between different RVPs such as the BioFire Film Array, GenMark eSensor, Luminex xTAG, and the new NxTAG, a significant advantage is the detection of multiple respiratory pathogens (Table 1).14\n",

In a meta\u2010analysis of 17 studies comparing A/H1pdm09 detection by IVAD to that with rtRT\u2010PCR, the estimated overall sensitivity of IVADs was 51% (ranging from 11% to 88%) (95% confidence interval) and the specificity was 98% (95% confidence interval).15 Another meta\u2010analysis of 159 similar studies assessing IVAD performance determined assay sensitivities to average 62.3% (95% confidence interval) and the specificity to be 98.2% (97.5%\u201098.7% confidence interval.) Result accuracy was variable, depending on whether the specimen was collected from a child or an adult, as well as virus type and subtype.16 Thus, IVADs cannot reliably detect emerging influenza subtypes, and their widespread use presents a risk of missing the spread of a potentially pandemic strain. For influenza surveillance, recommended practices include the confirmation of IVAD results using molecular assays or cell culture at the beginning and end of the influenza season.",

Means of reporting of demographic data, LOINC\u00ae and SNOMED\u00ae coding, and test descriptions need to be standardized. The addition of codes for new strains, as they arise, improves the granularity and accuracy of reporting.

The NYS alternate data could enhance national influenza surveillance for situational awareness due to its volume, geographic representation within NYS, and reliability. During 2013\u20102014, NYS experienced a second wave of influenza activity, mostly type B, as intense and long lasting as the first wave of influenza A/H1pdm09 activity. Several other northeast states also experienced this second wave of activity, but most of the United States did not.
