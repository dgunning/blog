Two decades ago, it was thought that viruses played a minor role in the pathogenesis of severe CAP, notwithstanding influenza epidemics [3]. Recent literature contradicts this and suggests that viruses are frequently found in severe CAP [4, 5].",

The availability of highly multiplexed commercial tests kits for common viral and bacterial pathogens has enabled these tests to be performed in large numbers of patients simultaneously, and across a variety of clinical settings [8, 9]. Multiple respiratory viruses may be present concurrently, or co-exist with bacterial pathogens to cause disease [10\u201312]. The reported incidence of viruses in severe CAP resulting in respiratory failure ranges 7.7% to 57% [4, 5]. This variation in the detection rate of viruses reflects potential limited availability of test assays and heterogeneity of physician practices in viral microbial diagnostic tests performed [13, 14]. Postulated prohibitive factors against the routine performance of viral diagnostics tests in patients with severe CAP may include a lack of clear clinical guidelines, perceived low cost-effectiveness and the paucity of effective anti-viral therapies for respiratory viruses other than influenza.",
