            "text": "Plasminogen activators are serine proteases which convert plasminogen to plasmin, thus promoting fibrinolysis. The identification of Pg-activators is very important due to their function in blood clot formation. The fibrinolytic system more appropriately referred as plasminogen (Pg) activator system, controls not only the intravascular fibrin deposition, but also participates in a wide variety of physiologic and pathologic processes. The Pg-activators cleave plasminogen to produce two chains of active plasmin by a single proteolytic cleavage of the Arg560-Val562 peptide bond [1]. Plasmin is responsible for the degradation of blood clots. Broadly, the Pg-activators are classified into two types based on their mechanism of function; direct and indirect activators. Pg-activators such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), widely found in tissues, and urokinase (UK), originally identified in urine, are classified into direct or multiple domain activators, since they have the functional capacity to convert plasminogen to active plasmin by cleaving the Arg-Val bond on the single-chain plasminogen to release two plasmin chains. UK is a 411 residue protein, consisting of three domains and is activated by proteolytic cleavage between L158 and I159 [2,3]. In contrast, Pg-activators of bacterial origins, such as Streptokinase (SK) and Staphylokinase (SAK), are often indirect activators [4-6]. Usually, indirect Pg-activators serve as co\u2013factors of plasminogen, forming an active 1:1 stoichiometric complex with plasminogen/plasmin that degrades fibrin clots [7]. SK is a single chain polypeptide made up of 414 amino acid residue and has a molar mass of 47 kDa. SK by itself is not a plasminogen activator, but it binds with free circulating plasminogen to form a complex (1:1), which can convert additional plasminogen to plasmin. Similarly, bacterial SAK, consists of a single polypeptide chain of 136 amino acids. The SAK\u2013plasminogen complex is however inactive, until it is converted to an active SAK-plasmin complex by other Pg-activators [8,9]. The Pg-activators of eukaryotic origin UK and tPA are trypsin like serine protease that activate plasminogen directly and are non-immunogenic. By contrast, bacterial pg-activators are generally indirect plasminogen activators which produce systemic fibrinolysis. tPA and SK are widely used thrombolytic agents for therapy. As tPA is a eukaryotic protein, it is difficult and costly to produce, but SK and SAK can be easily produced. However, it is widely accepted that these two therapeutic molecules suffer from serious complications such as immunogenicity (in SK), brain hemorrhage (SK as well tPA) and unwanted bleeding episodes. Therefore, identifying novel molecules which are really good therapeutics without complications is a desired but challenging task. This may require extensive bacterial screening or the development of other methods to search for new molecules. Nevertheless, there is a need to improve the efficacy of these Pg-activators and also a need to identify novel Pg-activators with more favorable Pg-activation characteristics.",

There are many statistical, similarity and evolutionary analysis available for protein and DNA [10-12] and, various prediction databases are available [13]. However, to our knowledge, no prediction tools are currently available to predict Pg-activators from protein sequences. According to the NCBI database, 82 genome, 2003 genes and 6200 proteins have been identified as plasminogen activator related sequence sources. With the sequencing of an increasing number of genomes, a large number of novel Pg-activator may remain to be discovered. For example, beside bacterial peptides, pg-activators have been identified in snake venom and Vampire bat saliva [14,15].",

We have designed a method, which is able to recognize the four subfamilies of SAK, SK, tPA and UK. The classification and assignment of pg-activators to various subfamilies was done on the basis of amino (AC), dipeptide composition (DC), PSSM profile and Hybrid approach using a machine learning based support vector Machine (SVM) methodology. The SVM based predictive approach is widely used to handle large data and it has been shown to perform well in multiple areas of biological data analysis, including classification, protein functions and type identification [16]. In this study, we have implemented SVM classifiers and used five-fold cross validation to evaluate the performance of all classifiers. For this, the dataset was randomly partitioned into five equal sets and evaluated five times with each distinct set used as input and the remaining four sets used for training. Our prediction tool can directly predict Pg-activator and their classification. Apart from this prediction study, a tool should provide additional basic information on input sequences. For this, we have also implemented programs to calculate the molecular weight, amino acid residues calculation and percentage of amino acid composition. Therefore, this tool will serve not only for prediction but also to know the basic properties of input sequences.",

The scoring graph represents the score of the prediction for all individual sequences tested (indexed on the horizontal axes), showing how the score of sequences in the positive set (left side of the graph) is separated from the negative set (right side) by a threshold (typically set to zero) that can be used to classify positive and negative predictions. However, not all positive or negative sequences may be correctly classified, leading to false negative and false positive prediction outcomes. To represent this aspect of the performance, the confusion matrix summarizes the outcomes of the prediction (Table 3) [22]. The analysis shows that only two Pg-activator sequences are negatively predicted in the PSSM model while amino, dipeptide and Hybrid models predicted all sequences in the test set correctly (Figures 3 and 4). In subfamilies classification, all subclasses were predicted correctly. The only misclassification was that tPA sequences were also often positively predicted by UK models and, conversely, UK sequences were sometimes positively predicted by tPA classifiers. This observation suggests some overlap between UK and tPA sequence composition. More interestingly, there is no confusion in the correct recognition of positive sequences of their corresponding models. The false positive rate (FPR) estimated on the negative dataset was 0.17, 0.25 and 0.18 in AC, DC and PSSM profile respectively.",

Streptokinase is a 414 amino-acid peptide secreted by many \u03b2-hemolytic streptococcal species. Streptokinase is composed of three domains (residues 1\u2013150), \u03b2 (residues 151\u2013287), and \u03b3 (residues 288\u2013414). Unlike urokinase (UK) and tPA that cleave the plasminogen bond Arg561-Val562 to generate plasmin, Streptokinase (SK) lacks intrinsic protease activity. Instead, SK forms a stoichiometric complex with Pg and coverts it to an activator complex. Staphylokinase is a single domain protein of 136 amino acids. It also like SK, forms a stoichiometric complex with plasminogen and the SK + Pg complex then activates plasminogen.",

Here, through a comprehensive approach we used amino acid, dipetide composition, PSSM profile and Hybrid methods to predict the putative Pg activation abilities of novel protein sequences. However, the approach is purely based on sequence composition and this does not explain any mechanistic details of Pg activation. So identifying and predicting the amino acid sequence which are related to differential mechanism and different specificity may need more rigorous computational as well as experimental methods. However, the results show that good predictions can be obtained from sequence composition alone, suggesting that certain features of sequence allow the useful discrimination of Pg-activators. However, SVM does not easily permit the direct identification of the feature having the most influence in any details, and this aspect will need to be explored further.",

It has been observed that all methods implemented are comparable predictors, including the simple amino acid composition model. A confusion matrix has been produced to cross check the predicted results, showing all prokaryotic pg-activators (SK, SAK) are correctly classified while few eukaryotic Pg-activators are misclassified. Remarkably, Cysteine (C) residues are absent in all prokaryotic Pg-activators. Tremendous amount of lysine (K) is present in prokaryotic Pg-activators, so this residue may play important contributions to indirect plasminogen activators.
