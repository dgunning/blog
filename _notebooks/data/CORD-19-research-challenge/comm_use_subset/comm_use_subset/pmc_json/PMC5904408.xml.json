The opportunistic fungus Candida albicans is among the most common causes of infection in health care institutions, and disseminated candidiasis is linked to mortality rates of greater than 40% (1\u20136). Major risk factors include the use of antibiotics, catheters, chemotherapy, and surgical intervention. The efficacy of existing antifungal drugs is limited, and consequently there is an urgent need to explore the interplay between C. albicans and the host defense response to decipher mechanisms that enable or disable systemic fungal invasion (7\u201310).",

            "text": "Interferons (IFNs) are critical mediators of innate immune defense that were originally discovered for their protection against viral infections (11\u201314). Subsequently they were found to elicit various biological responses, including inhibition of cancer malignancies, and so their clinical use was expanded (11, 15). IFNs are also produced in defense response to bacterial and fungal infections; however, IFNs are reported to have both protective and deleterious effects during infection with these microbes. Type I IFNs (predominantly IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2) bind to the same cell surface receptor composed of two subunits, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. Signal transduction by type I IFNs triggers the expression of hundreds of genes known as IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that confer varied biological effects in viral defense, differentiation, proliferation, and metabolism (16\u201319). In this report, we evaluated the role in invasive candidiasis of the IFN-induced gene with tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (IFIT2), also known as ISG54 (20). IFIT2 is a member of a family of ISGs with TPRs, structurally conserved motifs involved in multiple protein-protein interactions (21, 22). IFIT2 can form homodimers or stable complexes with two of its family members, IFIT1 and IFIT3 (23\u201325). Mice that lack the IFIT2 gene succumb to several negative-strand RNA virus infections, and expression of IFIT2 has been reported to inhibit proliferation and migration of cancer cells as well as promote their apoptosis (24, 26\u201330).",

The murine model of invasive candidiasis recapitulates the severe sepsis that can occur in clinical cases, resulting in a systemic hyperinflammatory response and renal failure (31). In contrast to the effect that IFIT2 loss has on host susceptibility to viral replication, we found that loss of IFIT2 improved host survival of invasive C. albicans infection. Comparative analyses of wild-type (WT) and IFIT2 knockout (ifit2\u2212/\u2212) mice revealed that ifit2\u2212/\u2212 mice respond with a heightened chemokine profile, a decrease in C. albicans titer, and improved overall survival. The loss of IFIT2 also correlated with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in bone marrow cells, potentially contributing to survival of C. albicans infection. This result implied a negative effect of IFIT2 on ROS production, and mechanistic evaluation identified the cytosolic regulator of the phagocytic NADPH oxidase, p67phox, as a binding partner of IFIT2. These findings indicate induction of IFIT2 during the host response to systemic C. albicans infection contributes to increased disease severity.",

The gene targeting scheme and expression of IFIT2 in ifit2+/+ (WT), ifit2+/\u2212, or ifit2\u2212/\u2212 (knockout [KO]) mice are shown in Fig. S1 in the supplemental material. Previous studies with an independently generated IFIT2 KO strain reported the mice are susceptible to viruses with a negative-sense RNA genome (26). Likewise our IFIT2 KO strain displayed a decreased survival of infection with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Fig. S1). However, in contrast to their response to VSV, the IFIT2 KO mice had a different response to disseminated C. albicans relative to their WT counterparts (Fig. 1A). IFIT2 KO mice receiving a bloodstream C. albicans inoculum of 2.5 \u00d7 105 CFU were better able to survive the infection. Ten days postinfection (p.i.), 95% of WT animals succumbed to infection, whereas nearly 50% of IFIT2 KO mice were alive. Thirty days postinfection, only 4% of WT mice were alive in contrast to 12% of the IFIT2 KO mice. Because renal insufficiency and kidney fungal burden correlate with lethality in this sepsis model, we evaluated kidneys of WT and IFIT2 KO mice (31, 38). Measurement of C. albicans titers in mice showed a decreased fungal burden in IFIT2 KO mice in comparison to WT mice at 24, 48, and 72 h postinfection (hpi) (Fig. 1B; see Fig. S2A in the supplemental material). Reduced kidney fungal burden in the IFIT2 KO mice appears to be predictive of survival. Western blot analyses demonstrated a clear induction of IFIT2 protein expression in WT kidneys during C. albicans infection (Fig. S2B). Although the average kidney weights in WT and IFIT2 KO mice were similar (Fig. S2C), fungal growth in IFIT2 KO mice was attenuated. The initial fungal burden was similar, but by 72 hpi, prior to signs of illness, the kidneys from IFIT2 KO mice had significantly reduced C. albicans CFU by 10-fold (Fig. 1B).",

Professional phagocytes express a number of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) that are stimulated in response to C. albicans, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectin receptors, and complement receptors (45, 46). Engagement of these receptors promotes engulfment of fungal cells and microbicidal action within phagolysosomes, as well as release of antimicrobial proteins. To determine the influence of IFIT2 on C. albicans phagocytosis, we measured the ability of freshly isolated bone marrow (BM) from WT or IFIT2 KO mice to phagocytize either live or heat-killed C. albicans. Phagocytosis of living C. albicans was measured by C. albicans green fluorescent protein (CaGFP) expression (47). BM cells were labeled with antibodies to CD45 conjugated with allophycocyanin (APC) and incubated with GFP-expressing C. albicans in the presence or absence of IFN-\u03b2. Flow cytometry was used to calculate the percentage of CD45-positive cells with CaGFP fluorescence. The percentage of CD45-positive cells with CaGFP appeared significantly higher in BM samples from WT cells compared with IFIT2 KO cells, either with or without IFN-\u03b2 treatment (Fig. 3B). Since this assay did not distinguish between CaGFP-expressing cells engulfed and bound to the surface of cells, we evaluated phagocytosis of heat-killed C. albicans. Heat-killed C. albicans cells were stained with SYBR-Safe green fluorescent dye and incubated with BM cells left untreated or treated with murine IFN-\u03b2. Propidium iodide was added to quench extracellular green fluorescence, and flow cytometry was used to quantify green fluorescence per BM cell. Results indicate WT BM cells phagocytize heat-killed C. albicans more efficiently than IFIT2 KO cells following stimulation with IFN-\u03b2 (Fig. 3B). Together the results indicate the loss of IFIT2 reduces phagocytosis of C. albicans.",

The primary enzyme complex responsible for ROS production is the membrane-associated NADPH oxidase that catalyzes the production of superoxide from oxygen and NADPH. Superoxide is converted into other damaging ROS, including hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorous acid. The importance of NADPH oxidase in fungal killing is evident in chronic granulomatous disease in which NADPH oxidase deficiency leads to susceptibility to recurrent fungal and bacterial infections (51). To evaluate the influence of IFIT2 on ROS production, we used the cell-permeable probe, 2\u2032,7\u2032-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) (52). Oxidation of DCFDA results in the formation of a fluorescent dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCF) product that is trapped inside the cell and can be monitored using flow cytometry. BM cells were isolated from WT or IFIT2 KO mice, incubated with DCFDA, and remained uninfected or were infected with C. albicans. Both uninfected BM cells and infected BM cells from the IFIT2 KO mice produced elevated levels of DCF in comparison to WT mice, indicating increased ROS production (Fig. 3C). The increase in ROS could contribute to the reduced fungal burden and increased survival of IFIT2 KO mice following C. albicans infection.",

NADPH oxidases are a family of enzyme complexes, and the phagocytic NADPH oxidase has been designated NOX2, or gp91phox (49, 50, 53). NOX2 associates with p22phox in plasma membranes, phagosomal membranes, and membranes of other intracellular vesicles. It is regulated by recruitment of cytosolic subunits p40phox, p47phox, and p67phox and the Rac GTPase. Since the loss of IFIT2 resulted in increased ROS production, the inference was that IFIT2 may inhibit the activity of NOX2. To determine if IFIT2 interacts with the NOX subunits, we expressed hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged human NOX subunits in cells with V5-tagged human IFIT2 and evaluated their association in immunocomplexes. Immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged NOX subunits identified specific association of IFIT2-V5 with p67phox by Western blots (Fig. 4A). We also demonstrated physical association of the murine IFIT2 with murine p67phox in immunocomplexes (Fig. 4B). Association of IFIT2 with p67phox was confirmed using reciprocal epitope tags for coimmunoprecipitations. Since chaperone heat shock proteins have been reported to regulate NOX and to complex with signaling proteins on mitochondria in pathogen defense, we also tested the association of IFIT2 with members of the heat shock protein family (54\u201356). We found specific association of IFIT2 with hsc70, a constitutively expressed cytosolic chaperone (Fig. 4C; see Fig. S3A in the supplemental material). Moreover, we further identified hsc70 to be a binding partner of p67phox, suggesting that all three proteins may form a functional complex (Fig. 4C). Both p67phox and hsc70 contain TPR domains, and it remains to be determined if specific binding to IFIT2 is mediated by TPR interactions. It is possible that the binding of IFIT2 to p67phox and hsc70 regulates p67phox recruitment to NOX2 or association with Rac (Fig. 4D).",

Neutrophil-depleted mice displayed accelerated behavioral signs of infection, and for this reason kidney fungal burden was measured at 48 hpi. The C. albicans titer was higher in both infected WT and IFIT2 KO animals treated with Ly6G antibody compared to mice lacking Ly6G treatment (Fig. 5A). A lower titer was still evident in IFIT2 KO mice compared to WT mice, indicating that although neutrophils were critical for defense against C. albicans infection, they were not responsible for the IFIT2 KO phenotype. The effectiveness of the Ly6G antibody was demonstrated by flow cytometry analysis of blood cells with Gr1 antibodies (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental material).",

Studies to investigate the role of specific cytokines and chemokines in the response to infection have shown that these mediators can be beneficial (e.g., IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, and CXCR1) (62\u201365), or they can be detrimental (CCR1) (66). IFNs are known for their protective effects during infectious disease, yet it is becoming more apparent that IFNs also can have detrimental consequences that exacerbate pathology (13, 59, 60). IFNs can promote production of chemokines and cytokines in a hyperinflammatory response that leads to tissue damage. To assess immune cell activation and recruitment, we measured chemokine and cytokine profiles during infection. The IFIT2 KO mice, in comparison to WT mice, produced significantly higher levels of proinflammatory chemokines such as CCL3, CXCL1, and CXCL5 during systemic infection with C. albicans (67) (Fig. 2A; Table S1). The increased synthesis of chemokines in the IFIT2 KO mice during systemic infection may promote the recruitment or activation of phagocytes and thereby contribute to survival and reduced fungal burden. Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry analyses showed a trend of higher leukocyte infiltration of IFIT2 KO mouse kidneys.",

            "text": "NADPH oxidases and mitochondria are two primary sources of cellular ROS, and are responsible for antimicrobial defense and signaling (44, 48\u201350, 56, 70, 71). The NADPH oxidase that is prevalent in phagocytic cells is designated gp91phox, or NOX2, and is associated in plasma and phagocyte membranes with p22phox (50, 53). Activation of NOX2 occurs following the translocation and association with a cytoplasmic complex of phosphorylated p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and Rac-GTP. Since the C. albicans-infected BM cells from the IFIT2 KO mice elicited higher ROS levels than WT cells, we postulated a potential IFIT2 mechanism of action that includes binding of IFIT2 with one of the subunits of the NADPH oxidase. This was demonstrated by specific coimmunoprecipitation of IFIT2 with p67phox, a key regulatory protein that binds Rac-GTP and NOX2 (Fig. 4) (72). This finding suggests the possibility that IFIT2 binds to p67phox and inhibits its ability to stimulate or associate with other subunits of the oxidase. Since NOX enzyme activity is regulated by heat shock proteins (54, 55), we evaluated the association of heat shock proteins with IFIT2. We found IFIT2 to be a binding partner of hsc70, a constitutively expressed heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) family member with TPR motifs (73). In addition, we demonstrated hsc70 binding to p67phox, suggesting that IFIT2, hsc70, and p67phox may cooperate to modulate NOX enzyme activity (54, 55).",

Since hsc70 is known to bind TOM70, a component of the mitochondrial import machinery (74, 75), and TOM70 contains TPR motifs, we tested the interaction of IFIT2 and TOM70. Specific coimmunoprecipitation indicated IFIT2 also associates with TOM70 (Fig. S3C). Therefore, it is possible that IFIT2 influences ROS production by both modulation of NADPH oxidase and mitochondrial protein import, especially since the TPR motifs of IFIT2, hsc70, and TOM70 could influence their association. Invasive C. albicans infections are prevalent in patients with chronic granulomatous disease caused by mutations in phagocyte NADPH oxidase subunits and the consequent reduced ROS. The improved survival and reduced fungal burden in IFIT2 KO mice systemically infected with C. albicans may reflect protective effects of enhanced ROS production.",

In addition, although IFN-\u03b2 treatment of infected mice increased pathology, in vitro, IFN-\u03b2 promoted antifungal activity of BM cells. These results indicate that the complexity of immune defense in vivo during invasive C. albicans infection cannot be reproduced in vitro under the conditions described. The ROS produced in vivo may serve to destroy pathogens, but may also serve as critical signaling molecules in the activation or recruitment of cells and mediators of defense. Differential chemokine/cytokine profiles affect responses of various recruited inflammatory cells and kidney cells in the animal that are not reflected in the in vitro assay.",

Neutrophil depletion resulted in increased fungal burden and pathogenesis in both WT and IFIT2 KO mice, and the IFIT2 KO mice were still better able to limit C. albicans replication in comparison with WT mice (Fig. 5A). In contrast, depletion of monocytes and macrophages with clodronate eliminated the differential ability of IFIT2 KO mice to reduce fungal burden (Fig. 5B). The kidney titer of C. albicans in clodronate-treated mice was significantly higher in IFIT2 KO mice than in WT mice (Fig. 5B).

Since the elimination of just one ISG (IFIT2) led to increased survival of systemic C. albicans in mice, it suggested that type I IFNs could have a generalized detrimental effect. For this reason, we determined the influence of IFN-\u03b2 administration during C. albicans infection. The most common approach to investigate the role of type I IFNs in murine models of disease has been to evaluate survival and pathology of mice that lack the gene encoding IFNAR1 (50, 78). Notably, experiments performed with systemic C. albicans infection of IFNAR1 KO mice have produced conflicting results. Studies reported IFNAR1 KO mice are either more susceptible to C. albicans infection (35, 36) or, alternatively, have increased survival of C. albicans infection (33, 34). Since type I IFNs are administered therapeutically to patients for the treatment of viral infections, cancer, and multiple sclerosis (11), we administered IFN-\u03b2 to mice and determined their response to invasive C. albicans. IFN-\u03b2 treatment was found to promote pathology and death from systemic C. albicans infection (Fig. 6). C. albicans titers in kidneys increased, and macrophage numbers in kidneys decreased with IFN-\u03b2 treatment. Moreover, IFN-\u03b2 treatment led to a dramatic increase in chemokine and cytokine production correlating with increased fungal burden in both WT and KO mice (Fig. 6 and 7; Tables S3 and S4). However, the fungal burden was consistently lower in IFIT2 KO mice, as it was without IFN-\u03b2 treatment. The difference between WT and IFIT2 KO mice did not appear to be due to different IFN levels since both groups displayed similar levels of IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 in the kidney lysates (Tables S2 and S4). While IFIT2 does not directly participate in regulation of IFN production, it is clearly involved in the response to IFN signaling. The moderate increase in chemokine and cytokine levels in infected IFIT2 KO mice without IFN-\u03b2 administration correlated with protection; however, the dramatic boost of chemokine and cytokine production following IFN-\u03b2 administration was deleterious. Proper regulation of IFN response is essential for development of a balanced immune response that is adequately strong to eliminate the pathogen but not severe enough to cause damage to the host. To our knowledge, this is the first study that directly evaluates the administration of type I IFN on the host response to C. albicans infection in a mouse model, and the results clearly caution the use of IFN therapy in patients at risk for infection.",
