PED is a serious health problem in suckling and nursing pigs that are typically 1-2 weeks of age. The mortality rate can be as high as 100% in 10-day-old or younger piglets. Pigs of all ages are susceptible to PEDV infection [2, 3]. PED occurrence has been reported in many countries, including Japan, Korea, France, Belgium, and Switzerland [4\u20136]; it was first reported in China in 1976 [7]. Since late 2010, millions of piglets have been killed in China during PED outbreaks, which significantly affected the pork meat supply and price [8]. PED becomes a severe disease and has led to a significant loss in the swine industry.",

The M protein, that is, structural M glycoprotein, plays an important role in the assembly process of the viral nucleocapsid and membrane [12].

Despite the administration of the vaccine, PED still affected farms in many provinces in late 2010 [8]. The reason for this remains unknown. To understand the genetic variations of PEDV and explain the remaining instances of PEDV, PEDV RNA was extracted directly from nasal and rectal samples of naturally infected piglets. The partial S, ORF3, M genes were amplified, sequenced, and analyzed. The amino acid (aa) sequences were predicted, based on which the phylogenetic trees were constructed and the hydrophobicity was analyzed. The similarities and differences between current and reference PEDVs were elucidated. These analyses were also useful for further molecular biology studies of PEDV strains that were prevalent in China.",

In this study, the data demonstrated that there was significant variation in S genes between the attenuated and virulent strains. Previous studies corroborated these results [8, 19]. Additionally, the newly isolated PEDV strains were highly homologous with each other but less similar to the vaccine strain CV777 or the virulent strain Chinju99 from Korea and CH/S from previous Chinese outbreaks. In the phylogenic trees, the current strains from different districts were genetically divided into different subgroups, but within each subgroup, the strains did not share the same geographical features. Also, these subgroups were genetically different from the groups of both attenuated strains (i.e., CV777 and attenuated DR13) and previous virulent strains (i.e., DR13, CH/S, and Chinju99). We can therefore draw a conclusion that the current strains in China represent a distinctive PEDV group and it is stable and virulent. The current strains displayed significant genetic variation from both the vaccine strains and previous strains. This may provide one possible answer for the nationwide outbreak and the poor efficacy of the vaccines. Previous studies showed that the S glycoprotein played an important role in viral attachment and penetration and was the neutralizing antibodies-inducing region due to the 2 B-cell linear epitopes [15]. In this study, the partial S proteins of current isolates, containing different aa to the previous strains due to mutations, were analyzed to determine the possible change on the protein hydrophobicity. When compared to the vaccine strain CV777, the current strains showed a significant hydrophobic alternation. This change was induced by a 4\u20139 aa mutations in the neutralizing epitope region of the current isolates and could provide one explanation for the poor immunity.",

In this study, the PEDV strains isolated from the current Chinese outbreaks had intact ORF3 genes that encoded 225 aa, which was in accordance with a previous study [13]. The phylogenic tree analysis demonstrated that the current strains should be clustered into the same group, despite of the different temporal and geographical origins (Figure 2(a)). This suggested that the ORF3 sequence was relatively conserved among stains from different temporal and geographical origins. A hydrophobicity analysis indicated that current isolates were different from the attenuated PEDV DR13 and vaccine strain CV777, which might be due to their adaptability and viral replication [14].",
